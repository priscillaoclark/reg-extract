Proposal Under OMB Delegated Authority To Extend for Three Years, With 
Revision, the Following Information Collection

    Collection title: Financial Statements for Holding Companies.\1\
---------------------------------------------------------------------------

    \1\ In addition to the FR Y-9, the Board proposes to revise 
without extension the Capital Assessments and Stress Testing Reports 
(FR Y-14A/Q/M; OMB No. 7100-0341) as a part of this clearance 
package. The revisions are explained below.
---------------------------------------------------------------------------

    Collection identifier: FR Y-9 reports.
    OMB control number: 7100-0128.
    General description of collection: The Board requires bank holding 
companies, most savings and loan holding companies, securities holding 
companies, and U.S. intermediate holding companies (collectively, HCs) 
to provide standardized financial statements through one or more of the 
FR Y-9 reports. The information collected on the FR Y-9 reports is 
necessary for the Board to identify emerging financial risks and 
monitor the safety and soundness of HC operations.
    The Consolidated Financial Statements for Holding Companies (FR Y-
9C) consists of standardized financial statements for HCs similar to 
the Call Reports filed by commercial banks. The FR Y-9C collects 
consolidated data and is filed quarterly by top-tier HCs with total 
consolidated assets of $3 billion or more.
    The Parent Company Only Financial Statements for Large Holding 
Companies (FR Y-9LP), must be submitted quarterly by each HC that files 
the FR Y-9C, as well as by each of its subsidiary HCs. The report 
consists of standardized financial statements, including the following 
schedules: Income Statement, Cash Flow Statement, Balance Sheet, 
Investments in Subsidiaries and Associated Companies, Memoranda, and 
Notes to the Parent Company Only Financial Statements.
    The Parent Company Only Financial Statements for Small Holding 
Companies (FR Y-9SP), is filed semiannually by HCs with total 
consolidated assets of less than $3 billion. In a banking organization 
with total consolidated assets of less than $3 billion that has tiered 
HCs, each HC in the organization must submit, or have the top-tier HC 
submit on its behalf, a separate FR Y-9SP. This report collects basic 
balance sheet and income data for the parent company, as well as data 
on its intangible assets and intercompany transactions.
    The Financial Statements for Employee Stock Ownership Plan Holding 
Companies (FR Y-9ES) is filed annually by each employee stock ownership 
plan (ESOP) that is also an HC. The report collects financial data on 
the ESOP's benefit plan activities. The FR Y-9ES consists of four 
schedules: Statement of Changes in Net Assets Available for Benefits, 
Statement of Net Assets Available for Benefits, Memoranda, and Notes to 
the Financial Statements.
    The instructions to each of the FR Y-9C, FR Y-9LP, FR Y-9SP, and FR 
Y-9ES state that respondent HCs should retain workpapers and other 
records used in the preparation of the reports for a period of three 
years following submission. In addition, HCs must maintain in their 
files a manually signed and attested printout of the data submitted 
under each form for a period of three years.
    The Supplement to the Consolidated Financial Statements for Holding 
Companies (FR Y-9CS) is a voluntary, free-form supplemental report that 
the Board may utilize to collect critical additional data deemed to be 
needed from HCs in an expedited manner. The FR Y-9CS data collections 
are used to assess and monitor emerging issues related to HCs, and the 
report is intended to supplement the other FR Y-9 reports. The data 
requested by the FR Y-9CS would depend on the Board's data needs in any 
given situation. For example, changes made by the Financial Accounting 
Standards Board may introduce into generally accepted accounting 
principles new data items that are not currently collected by the other 
FR Y-9 reports. The Board could use the FR Y-9CS report to collect 
these

[[Page 80246]]

data until the items are implemented into the other FR Y-9 reports.
    Proposed revisions:
    The Board proposes to revise the FR Y-9C by (1) adding new line 
items to gather additional information regarding loans to nondepository 
financial institutions (NDFIs), (2) revising the instructions to 
include additional detail on the types of loans that should be reported 
as loans to NDFIs, (3) adding a new line item to capture the amount of 
structured financial products guaranteed by U.S. Government or 
sponsored agencies, (4) revising the instructions to permit HCs to use 
electronic signatures to comply with the FR Y-9C signature and 
attestation requirement, and (5) making other minor clarifications and 
conforming edits to the form and instructions. These revisions would 
also be consistent with proposed revisions \2\ to the Federal Financial 
Institutions Examination Council (FFIEC) Consolidated Reports of 
Condition and Income (Call Reports) (FFIEC 031, FFIEC 041, and FFIEC 
051; OMB No. 7100-0036).
---------------------------------------------------------------------------

    \2\ See 89 FR 45046 (May 22, 2024).
---------------------------------------------------------------------------

    The Board also proposes to revise the FR Y-9LP to instruct holding 
companies to report leases in accordance with Accounting Standards 
Update 2016-02, ``Leases'' (ASU 2016-02). There are no proposed 
revisions at this time for the FR Y-9SP, FR Y-9ES, or FR Y-9CS.
    The Board also proposes to revise the Capital Assessments and 
Stress Testing Reports (FR Y-14A/Q/M; OMB No. 7100 0341) FR Y-14Q to 
align Schedule H.1, item 26, with the FR Y-9C proposed line items 
related to NDFIs. This change would have no effect on the hourly burden 
for the FR Y-14Q. There are no proposed revisions to the FR Y-14A/M as 
a part of this clearance. There is a separate notice for comment on the 
extension, with revision, of the FR Y-14A/Q/M, which published in the 
Federal Register on June 21, 2024 (89 FR 52042), and contains a full 
description of the FR Y-14A/Q/M information collection, including 
respondent burden estimates. The revisions proposed in that notice are 
unrelated to this revision. After considering any comments received 
related to all proposed revisions of the FR Y-14A/Q/M, the Board may 
finalize all FR Y-14A/Q/M revisions in a single Federal Register notice 
and supporting statement, separate from any Federal Register notice and 
supporting statement related to the FR Y-9.
    All proposed changes mentioned above would take effect as of the 
December 31, 2024, report date.
    Frequency: Quarterly, semiannual, annual, and as needed.
