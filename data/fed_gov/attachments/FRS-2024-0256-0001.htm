Proposal Under OMB Delegated Authority To Extend for Three Years, 
Without Revision, the Following Information Collection

    Collection title: Complex Institution Liquidity Monitoring Report.
    Collection identifier: FR 2052a.
    OMB control number: 7100-0361.
    General description of collection: The FR 2052a collects 
quantitative information on select assets, liabilities, funding 
activities, and contingent liabilities of certain banking 
organizations. The Board uses this information to monitor the liquidity 
profile of these banking organizations.
    The data collected by the FR 2052a provide detailed information 
about the liquidity risks within different business lines (e.g., 
financing of securities positions or prime brokerage activities) of 
certain large banking organizations supervised by the Board. The 
Board's supervisory surveillance program relies on this data, which 
provide timely information about banking organization-specific 
liquidity risks during periods of stress. The Board uses analyses of 
liquidity risk to inform its supervisory processes, including the 
preparation of analytical reports that detail funding vulnerabilities. 
FR 2052a data also contribute to the Board's supervisory monitoring 
efforts by identifying potential impediments to the movement of 
liquidity across legal entities. In addition, the FR 2052a provides 
detailed information that the Board uses to monitor compliance with the 
Liquidity Coverage Ratio (LCR) and Net Stable Funding Ratio (NSFR) 
rules under the Board's Regulation WW--Liquidity Risk Measurement, 
Standards, and Monitoring (12 CFR part 249)
    Frequency: Daily, monthly.

how long it takes to comply with these requirements such as the number
