SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION: 
    Title of Collection: Survey Screening Questions.
    OMB Control Number: 3170-00XX.
    Type of Review: New information collection.
    Affected Public: Individuals.
    Estimated Number of Respondents: 50,000.
    Estimated Total Annual Burden Hours: 12,500.
    Abstract: The CFPB conducts a variety of research efforts to 
ascertain financial issues the American public may be experiencing. The 
CFPB developed a list of potential screener questions formulated to 
allow their research efforts to focus on the appropriate consumers for 
each study and strengthen our ability to address financial needs and 
concerns of the public and to improve the CFPB's delivery of services 
and programs. Usage of the included questions will ensure CFPB's future 
survey efforts target applicable respondents, reduce administrative 
burden on the CFPB, and grant greater flexibility in conducting 
research on emergent financial issues.
    Request for Comments: Comments are invited on: (a) Whether the 
collection of information is necessary for the proper performance of 
the functions of the CFPB, including whether the information will have 
practical utility; (b) The accuracy of the CFPB's estimate of the 
burden of the collection of information, including the validity of the 
methods and the assumptions used; (c) Ways to enhance the quality, 
utility, and clarity of the information to be collected; and (d) Ways 
to minimize the burden of the collection of information on respondents, 
including through the use of automated collection techniques or other 
forms of information technology. Comments submitted in response to this 
notice will be summarized and/or included in the request for OMB 
approval. All comments will become a matter of public record.

Anthony May,
Paperwork Reduction Act Officer, Consumer Financial Protection Bureau.
