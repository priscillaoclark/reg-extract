SECURITIES AND EXCHANGE COMMISSION

[Release No. 34-100247; File No. SR-MEMX-2024-21]


Self-Regulatory Organizations; MEMX LLC; Notice of Filing and 
Immediate Effectiveness of a Proposed Rule Change To Implement an 
Equity Rights Program

May 30, 2024.
    Pursuant to Section 19(b)(1) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 
(``Act''),\1\ and Rule 19b-4 thereunder,\2\ notice is hereby given that 
on May 22, 2024, MEMX LLC (``MEMX'' or ``Exchange'') filed with the 
Securities and Exchange Commission (``Commission'') the proposed rule 
change as described in Items I, II, and III below, which Items have 
been prepared by the Exchange. The Commission is publishing this notice 
to solicit comments on the proposed rule change from interested 
persons.

I. Self-Regulatory Organization's Statement of the Terms of Substance 
of the Proposed Rule Change

    The Exchange is filing with the Commission a proposed rule change 
to implement an equity rights program (the ``Warrants Program'' or the 
``Jump Ball Program'') related to fees charged for the trading of 
options on the Exchange's options platform (``MEMX Options''). The 
Exchange proposes to implement the changes to the Fee Schedule pursuant 
to this proposal immediately.

II. Self-Regulatory Organization's Statement of the Purpose of, and 
Statutory Basis for, the Proposed Rule Change

    In its filing with the Commission, the Exchange included statements 
concerning the purpose of and basis for the proposed rule change and 
discussed any comments it received on the proposed rule change. The 
text of these statements may be examined at the places specified in 
Item IV below. The Exchange has prepared summaries, set forth in 
sections A, B, and C below, of the most significant aspects of such 
statements.

A. Self-Regulatory Organization's Statement of the Purpose of, and 
Statutory Basis for, the Proposed Rule Change

1. Purpose
    The Exchange proposes to implement the Warrants Program pursuant to 
which warrants representing the right to acquire equity in the 
Exchange's parent holding company upon vesting would be issued to 
participants on MEMX Options who also participate in the Warrants 
Program (``Participants''), in exchange for payment of the initial 
prepayment fee (``Prepayment Fee'') and the achievement of certain 
liquidity volume thresholds on the Exchange's options platform (``MEMX 
Options'') over a 24-month period (the ``Term''). The Warrants Program 
commenced on May 1, 2024 (the ``Effective Date'') and will end on May 
1, 2026.\3\ The purpose of the Warrants Program is to promote the long-
term interests of MEMX by providing incentives designed to encourage 
MEMX market participants to contribute to the growth and success of 
MEMX Options via actively providing and taking liquidity on the MEMX 
Options market. Participants in the Warrants Program will be able to 
vest their warrants through the process described in the following 
paragraphs and consequently will have the opportunity to share in the 
benefits of MEMX's increased enterprise value.
---------------------------------------------------------------------------

    \3\ The Exchange initially filed the proposal to implement the 
Warrants Program on April 25, 2024 (SR-MEMX-2024-15) (the ``Initial 
Proposal''). On May 10, 2024, the Exchange withdrew the Initial 
Proposal and replaced the proposal with SR-MEMX-2024-18 (the 
``Second Proposal''). The Exchange recently withdrew the Second 
Proposal and is replacing it with the current filing (SR-MEMX-2024-
21).
---------------------------------------------------------------------------

    Participants who executed a Purchase Agreement and who provide a 
Prepayment Fee in the amount of $500,000 in advance of April 30, 2024 
(the ``Commitment Deadline'') or such later date specified by the 
Exchange were issued a ``ticket'' indicating that the Participant has 
been accepted into the Warrants Program. Participants may purchase more 
than one ticket. The total number of tickets available for purchase is 
capped at 25 tickets. Upon making the Prepayment Fee corresponding to 
the number of tickets purchased, a Participant will be able to apply 
the Prepayment Fee to various fees for trading on MEMX Options, 
including MEMX Options connectivity fees,\4\ MEMX Options market data 
fees,\5\ MEMX Options membership fees,\6\ and MEMX Options transaction 
fees.\7\ The Prepayment Fee does not expire and a Participant may apply 
the Prepayment Fee to any of the above listed fees at any time. A 
Participant will obtain 279,600 unvested warrants per ticket that will 
vest on an equalized basis each calendar month during the Term (each 
such calendar month during the Term of the Warrants Program, a 
``Measurement Period'') if such Participant satisfies certain volume 
commitments on MEMX Options, as described below.
---------------------------------------------------------------------------

    \4\ See the MEMX Connectivity Fee Schedule, available at <a href="https://info.memxtrading.com/connectivity-fees/">https://info.memxtrading.com/connectivity-fees/</a>.
    \5\ See the MEMX Options Fee Schedule, available at <a href="https://info.memxtrading.com/us-options-trading-resources/us-options-fee-schedule/">https://info.memxtrading.com/us-options-trading-resources/us-options-fee-schedule/</a>.
    \6\ See the MEMX Membership Fee Schedule, available at <a href="https://info.memxtrading.com/membership-fees/">https://info.memxtrading.com/membership-fees/</a>.

---------------------------------------------------------------------------

    Participants shall vest warrants on a pro-rata basis based upon 
meeting or outperforming volume commitments during each Measurement 
Period, as is discussed below. The volume commitments may be met by 
trading activity in any listed equity option or exchange-traded fund 
option on MEMX Options.\8\ Participants that trade options which are 
not in the Penny Program \9\ (such options, ``Non-Penny'' options) will 
receive double credit for such Non-Penny activity for purposes of 
calculating the Participant's performance during the Measurement 
Period. Each vested warrant entitles a Participant to purchase equity 
ownership of one Nonvoting Common Unit \10\ of Holdco at a particular 
strike price. Only vested warrants are eligible to be exercised, and 
un-vested warrants are not exercisable. The total equity ownership of 
Holdco Units, including any purchased through the exercise of vested 
warrants, shall be subject to the ownership limitations of the Seventh 
Amended and Restated Limited Liability Company Agreement of MEMX 
Holdings LLC, as amended (the ``Holdco LLC Agreement'').\11\
---------------------------------------------------------------------------

    \8\ The Exchange does not currently list or trade index options.
    \9\ See Exchange Rule 21.5(d).
    \10\ ``Nonvoting Common Units'' is defined in Section 
3.2(g)(iii) of the Seventh Amended and Restated Limited Liability 
Company Agreement of MEMX Holdings LLC.
    \11\ See, e.g., Section 3.5(a)(ii) of the Holdco LLC Agreement, 
which states that ``[n]o Exchange Member, either alone or together 
with its Related Persons, may own, directly or indirectly, of record 
or beneficially, Units constituting more than twenty percent (20%) 
of any class of Units.''

---------------------------------------------------------------------------

[[Page 48204]]

Volume Requirements
    The target performance (``Target Performance'') for any Participant 
is 25 basis points of Total Consolidated Volume \12\ (``TCV'') on MEMX 
Options per Measurement Period, per ticket. Thus, if a Participant 
achieves the Target Performance during any Measurement Period, the 
Participant's full allotment of unvested warrants for that Measurement 
Period will vest (i.e., 11,650 warrants per calendar month, per 
ticket). The Target Performance for any Participant is on a per ticket 
basis, thus, a Participant with two tickets has a Target Performance of 
50 basis points of TCV per Measurement Period, a Participant with three 
tickets has a Target Performance of 75 basis points of TCV per 
Measurement Period, and so forth. During any Measurement Period, 
Participants that do not meet the Target Performance but meet certain 
minimum performance levels will have their warrants vest proportionally 
to their performance, as illustrated in the following table. If a 
Participant reaches a minimum percentage of the volume commitment set 
out in the second column of the below table (equivalent to the number 
of basis points set out in the third column of the below table), the 
Participant will earn a reduced number of warrants on a proportional 
basis applicable to such Measurement Period.
---------------------------------------------------------------------------

    \12\ Total Consolidated Volume is calculated as the volume 
reported by all exchanges and trade reporting facilities to a 
consolidated transaction reporting plan for the month for which the 
fees apply.

------------------------------------------------------------------------

            Measurement period                 minimum     minimum basis

Month 1 through Month 3...................            40              10
Month 4 through Month 6...................            50            12.5
Month 7 through Month 24..................            60              15
------------------------------------------------------------------------

    For example, if a Participant with one ticket achieves 10 basis 
points of volume on MEMX Options in the month 1 Measurement Period, the 
Participant will vest 40% of their warrants for such month (4,660 
vested warrants). As another example, if a Participant with two tickets 
achieves 13 basis points of volume on MEMX Options during the month 1 
Measurement Period, the Participant will vest 26% of their warrants for 
such month (i.e., 13 basis points of the 50 basis point Target 
Performance based on two tickets) on a proportional basis (6,058 vested 
warrants). However, if a Participant with any number of tickets 
achieves 8 basis points of volume on MEMX Options in the month 1 
Measurement Period, the Participant will vest no warrants for such 
month.
    If a Participant fails to meet the performance minimum for any 
Measurement Period corresponding to month 1 through month 11, such 
Participant will have the opportunity to vest their unvested warrants 
if such Participant over-performs in a subsequent Measurement Period 
that corresponds to month 2 through month 12. For example, if a 
Participant with one ticket achieves 25 basis points of volume on MEMX 
Options in month 1, 12.5 basis points in month 2, 37.5 basis points in 
month 3, and 25 basis points in months 4 through 12, such Participant 
can recover their un-vested 5,825 warrants from month 2 based on such 
Participant's activity in month 3. Using the same example, if the 
Participant achieves the same number of basis points noted in the above 
example in this paragraph for months 1, 2, and 4 through 12 but only 
achieves 31 basis points in month 3, such Participant can recover 2,796 
of the un-vested 5,825 warrants from month 2, and would forfeit the 
remaining 3,029 warrants. Partial basis points and partial warrants 
achieved will be rounded according to standard rounding conventions 
(i.e., rounded up if equal to or greater than 0.5, rounded down if 
below 0.5). To again use the same example, if the Participant achieves 
the same number of basis points noted in the first example of this 
paragraph in months 1, 2, and 4 through 12 but only achieves 30.65 
basis points in month 3, such Participant can recover 2,633 of the un-
vested 5,825 warrants from month 2 (rounding up from 2,632.9 un-vested 
warrants), and would forfeit the remaining 3,192 warrants.
    As another example, if a Participant with one ticket achieved 10 
basis points of volume on MEMX Options in each of months 1, 2, and 3, 
12.5 basis points in each of months 4, 5, and 6, 40 basis points in 
each of months 7, 8, and 9, and 37.5 basis points in each of months 10, 
11, and 12, such Participant can recover 6,990 un-vested warrants from 
each of months 1, 2, and 3 and 5,825 un-vested warrants from each of 
months 4, 5, and 6, for a total of 38,445 warrants recovered. If the 
Participant in the example above had three tickets, the warrants would 
vest such that such participant would earn 4,660 warrants in each of 
months 1, 2, and 3, would earn 5,825 warrants in each of months 4, 5, 
and 6, would earn 18,640 warrants in each of months 7, 8, and 9, and 
would earn 17,475 warrants in each of months 10, 11, and 12, for a 
total of 139,800 warrants vested. Such participant would recover none 
of the 279,600 warrants forfeited for the year. Further, if a 
Participant with one ticket achieves 25 basis points of volume on MEMX 
Options in month 1, 12.5 basis points in each of months 2 through 4, 25 
basis points in each of months 5 through 12, and 50 basis points in 
month 13, the Participant's over-performance in month 13 cannot be 
applied to vest units from under-performing activity in months 1-11.
    If a Participant fails to meet the performance minimum for a 
Measurement Period corresponding to month 13 through month 23, such 
Participant will similarly have the opportunity to vest their unvested 
warrants if such Participant over-performs in a subsequent Measurement 
Period that corresponds to month 14 through month 24. For example, if a 
Participant achieves 15 basis points of volume on MEMX Options in month 
13, 25 basis points in month 14, 45 basis points in month 15, and 25 
basis points in each of months 16 through 24, such Participant can 
recover their un-vested 4,660 warrants from month 13 based on such 
Participant's activity in month 15. As a further example, if a 
Participant achieves the same number of basis points noted in the above 
example in this paragraph for months 13, 14, and 16 through 24, but 
achieves 27.14 basis points in month 15, such Participant can recover 
997 of the un-vested 4,660 warrants from month 13 (rounded down from 
997.24 un-vested warrants), and would forfeit the remaining 3,663 
warrants.
Restrictions on Vesting
    Each vested warrant shall be exercisable from the time of vesting

[[Page 48205]]

until the seventh anniversary of the first day of the first calendar 
month after the Effective Date. Vested warrants may be exercised when a 
Participant pays the exercise price of the warrant. Warrants have not 
been registered under the Securities Act of 1933. Each Participant will 
have a standard piggyback registration right to include the Nonvoting 
Common Units issuable upon exercise of the warrants should Holdco at a 
later date file a Registration Statement under the Securities Act of 
1933. The Nonvoting Common Units may not be transferred except pursuant 
to an effective registration statement under the Securities Act of 1933 
and such state securities laws, or an exemption from such registration 
thereunder, and are subject to transfer restrictions set forth in the 
Holdco LLC Agreement.\13\ In the event of a Qualified Public Offering 
as defined in the Holdco LLC Agreement, the Nonvoting Common Units are 
subject to the transfer restrictions in Section 10.3 of the Holdco LLC 
Agreement, and MEMX shall have right of first offer on the transfer of 
such Nonvoting Common Units. In the event that Holdco sells Nonvoting 
Common Units to the public in an initial public offering pursuant to a 
registration statement declared effective by the SEC, then Holdco will 
give any Participant who holds warrants notice of the date when the 
initial public offering will take place. In such case, the fair market 
value of the Nonvoting Common Units will be as specified in the final 
prospectus regarding the initial public offering as filed with the SEC.
---------------------------------------------------------------------------

    \13\ See, e.g, Sections 10.3, 10.4, and 10.5 of the Holdco LLC 
Agreement. The Exchange notes that such Sections refer to Common 
Members throughout, rather than specifically referring to Nonvoting 
Common Units. Section 1.1 of the Holdco LLC Agreement defines a 
``Common Member'' as a member in Holdco ``holding Common Units in 
its capacity as such, together with its Affiliates that hold Common 
Units. . . .'' Accordingly, the term Common Member includes any 
Holdco member, and does not distinguish between Holdco members 
holding Voting Common Units and members holding Nonvoting Common 
Units. As such, the transfer restrictions noted in the Holdco LLC 
Agreement, which refer to Common Members, are applicable to 
Nonvoting Common Units.
---------------------------------------------------------------------------

    All applicants will be subject to the same eligibility and 
designation criteria, and all Participants will participate in the 
Program on the same terms, conditions and restrictions. To be 
designated as a Participant, an applicant must: (i) be a registered 
broker-dealer pursuant to Section 15 of the Securities Exchange Act of 
1934 (the ``Act''); (ii) qualify as an ``accredited investor'' as such 
term is defined in Regulation D of the Securities Act of 1933; \14\ and 
(iii) have executed all required documentation for participation in the 
Warrants Program. Participants may be, but are not required to be, 
current investors in Holdco, and the Exchange anticipates both current 
and new investors to participate in the Warrants Program. Participants 
must have executed the definitive documentation, satisfied the 
eligibility criteria required of Warrants Program participants 
enumerated above, and tendered the Prepayment Fee by the Commitment 
Deadline.
---------------------------------------------------------------------------

    \14\ The purpose of this criterion relates to the ability of 
Holdco to sell shares of common stock pursuant to an exemption from 
registration under the Securities Act of 1933. The definition of 
``accredited investor'' under Rule 501(a)(1) of the Securities Act 
of 1933 includes any broker or dealer registered pursuant to Section 
15 of the Act. As noted above, a Participant will be required to be 
registered as a broker or dealer pursuant to Section 15 of the Act, 
therefore all Participants will satisfy this criterion.
---------------------------------------------------------------------------

    As discussed above, the purpose of the Program is to encourage 
Participants to direct greater trade volume to MEMX Options to enhance 
trading volume on MEMX's options platform. Increased volume will 
provide for greater liquidity and enhanced price discovery, which 
benefits all market participants. Other exchanges have previously 
engaged in the practice of incentivizing increased order flow in order 
to attract liquidity providers through equity sharing arrangements.\15\ 
The Warrants Program similarly intends to attract order flow, which 
will increase liquidity, thereby providing greater trading 
opportunities and tighter spreads for other market participants and 
causing a corresponding increase in order flow from these other market 
participants. The Warrants Program will similarly reward the liquidity 
providers that provide this additional volume with a potential 
proprietary interest in MEMX.

---------------------------------------------------------------------------

2. Statutory Basis
    The Exchange believes that its proposed rule change is consistent 
with Section 6(b) of the Act \16\ in general, and furthers the 
objectives of Section 6(b)(5) of the Act \17\ in particular, in that it 
is designed to prevent fraudulent and manipulative acts and practices, 
to promote just and equitable principles of trade, to foster 
cooperation and coordination with persons engaged in facilitating 
transactions in securities, to remove impediments to and perfect the 
mechanisms of a free and open market and a national market system and, 
in general, to protect investors and the public interest. Additionally, 
the Exchange believes the proposed rule change is consistent with the 
Section 6(b)(5) of the Act \18\ requirement that the rules of an 
exchange not be designed to permit unfair discrimination between 
customers, issuers, brokers, or dealers. The Exchange also believes the 
proposed rule change is consistent with Section 6(b)(4) of the Act,\19\ 
which requires that Exchange rules provide for the equitable allocation 
of reasonable dues, fees, and other charges among its members and other 
persons using its facilities.
---------------------------------------------------------------------------

    \16\ 15 U.S.C. 78f.
    \17\ 15 U.S.C. 78f(b)(5).
    \18\ See id.
    \19\ 15 U.S.C. 78f(b)(4).
---------------------------------------------------------------------------

    The Exchange believes that the proposed rule change is equitable 
and not unfairly discriminatory, because all Participants may elect to 
participate (or elect not to participate) in the Warrants Program and 
vest warrants on the same terms and conditions, assuming they satisfy 
the same eligibility criteria as described above. The eligibility 
criteria are objective; thus, all Participants have the ability to 
satisfy the eligibility criteria to obtain a ``ticket'' for 
participation. Any Participant that becomes a ticket holder and pays 
the Prepayment Fee and otherwise satisfies the eligibility criteria has 
the same opportunity for their warrants to vest through volume 
contributions. The volume performance requirements are the same for all 
Participants, all Participants have the same opportunity to earn vested 
warrants on a proportional basis based upon meeting fixed volume 
threshold amounts during the Measurement Periods that will apply to all 
Participants. This ensures that all Participants will have the same 
opportunity to vest warrants and to exercise those warrants to purchase 
Non-Voting Common Units if they so choose. As noted above, Participants 
may be, but are not required to be, current investors in Holdco, and 
the Exchange anticipates both current and new investors to participate 
in the Warrants Program.
    The Exchange believes that the methodology used to calculate the 
volume thresholds is fair, reasonable

[[Page 48206]]

and not unfairly discriminatory because it is based on objective 
criteria that is designed to increase trading volume on the Exchange's 
recently launched Options platform. The Warrants Program is designed to 
reward Participants for bringing their orders and quotes to the 
Exchange to be executed on the Exchange. The Exchange believes it is 
appropriate to exclude options on indices from the volume calculation 
because the Exchange wishes to support volume in equity options and 
ETFs on the MEMX Options platform and MEMX Options does not currently 
trade index options. The Exchange also believes it is appropriate to 
provide double credit for activity in Non-Penny options for purposes of 
calculating the Participant's performance during the Measurement Period 
to encourage and reward such activity because the Exchange's fees for 
such products generate additional revenue for the Exchange as compared 
to options that are in the Penny Program.
    The Exchange believes the Warrants Program is equitable and 
reasonable because an increase in volume and liquidity would benefit 
all market participants by providing more trading opportunities and 
tighter spreads, even to those market participants that do not 
participate in the Warrants Program. Additionally, the Exchange 
believes the proposed rule change is consistent with the Act because, 
as described above, the Warrants Program is designed to bring greater 
volume and liquidity to the Exchange, which will benefit all market 
participants by providing tighter quoting and better prices, all of 
which perfects the mechanism for a free and open market and national 
market system.

B. Self-Regulatory Organization's Statement on Burden on Competition

    The Exchange does not believe that the proposed rule change will 
impose any burden on competition not necessary or appropriate in 
furtherance of the purposes of the Act. The Exchange believes that the 
proposed rule change will improve competition by providing market 
participants the opportunity to execute orders and post liquidity on 
the Exchange's options market.
    The Exchange believes that the proposed change would increase both 
intermarket and intramarket competition by incentivizing Participants 
to direct their orders to the Exchange, which will enhance the quality 
of quoting and increase the volume of contracts traded on the Exchange. 
To the extent that there is an additional competitive burden on non-
Participants, the Exchange believes that this is appropriate because 
the Program should incent Participants to direct additional order flow 
to the Exchange and thus provide additional liquidity that enhances the 
quality of its market and increases the volume of contracts traded on 
the Exchange. To the extent that this purpose is achieved, the Exchange 
believes that all of the Exchange's market participants would benefit 
from the improved market liquidity. Enhanced market quality and 
increased transaction volume that results from the anticipated increase 
in order flow directed to the Exchange will benefit all market 
participants and improve competition on the Exchange.
    Given the robust competition for volume among options markets, many 
of which offer the same products, implementing a program to attract 
order flow like the one proposed in this filing is consistent with the 
above-mentioned goals of the Act. This is especially true for the 
smaller options markets, such as MEMX, which is competing for volume 
with much larger exchanges that dominate the options trading industry. 
As a new exchange, MEMX has a nominal percentage of the average daily 
trading volume in options, so it is unlikely that the Warrants Program 
could cause any competitive harm to the options market or to market 
participants. Rather, the Warrants Program is a modest attempt to 
attract order volume away from larger competitors by adopting an 
innovative pricing strategy. The Exchange notes that if the Warrants 
Program results in a modest percentage increase in the average daily 
trading volume on MEMX, while such percentage would represent a large 
volume increase for MEMX, it would represent a minimal reduction in 
volume of its larger competitors in the industry. The Exchange believes 
that the Program will help further competition, because market 
participants will have yet another additional option in determining 
where to execute orders and post liquidity if they factor the benefits 
of MEMX equity participation into the determination.

C. Self-Regulatory Organization's Statement on Comments on the Proposed 
Rule Change Received From Members, Participants, or Others

    The Exchange neither solicited nor received comments on the 
proposed rule change.

III. Date of Effectiveness of the Proposed Rule Change and Timing for 
Commission Action

    The foregoing rule change has become effective pursuant to Section 
19(b)(3)(A)(ii) of the Act \20\ and Rule 19b-4(f)(2) \21\ thereunder.
---------------------------------------------------------------------------

    \20\ 15 U.S.C. 78s(b)(3)(A)(ii).
    \21\ 17 CFR 240.19b-4(f)(2).
---------------------------------------------------------------------------

    At any time within 60 days of the filing of the proposed rule 
change, the Commission summarily may temporarily suspend such rule 
change if it appears to the Commission that such action is necessary or 
appropriate in the public interest, for the protection of investors, or 
otherwise in furtherance of the purposes of the Act. If the Commission 
takes such action, the Commission shall institute proceedings to 
determine whether the proposed rule change should be approved or 
disapproved.

IV. Solicitation of Comments

    Interested persons are invited to submit written data, views and
