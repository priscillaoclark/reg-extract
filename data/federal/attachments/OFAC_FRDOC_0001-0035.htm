Act, 50 U.S.C. 1701-1706, and the United Nations Participation Act of 
1945, 22 U.S.C. 287c. In the Order, the President declared a national 
emergency to address grave acts of terrorism and threats of terrorism 
committed by foreign terrorists, including the September 11, 2001, 
terrorist attacks in New York, Pennsylvania, and at the Pentagon. The 
Order imposes economic sanctions on persons who have committed, pose a 
significant risk of committing, or support acts of terrorism. The 
President identified in the Annex to the Order, as amended by Executive 
Order 13268 of July 2, 2002, 13 individuals and 16 entities as subject 
to the economic sanctions. The Order was further amended by Executive 
Order 13284 of January 23, 2003, to reflect the creation of the 
Department of Homeland Security.

the security of U.S. nationals or the national security, foreign 
policy, or economy of the United States; (3) persons determined by the 
Director of OFAC, in consultation with the Departments of State, 
Homeland Security and Justice, to be owned or controlled by, or to act 
for or on behalf of those persons listed in the Annex to the Order or 
those persons determined to be subject to subsection 1(b), 1(c), or 
1(d)(i) of the Order; and (4) except as provided in section 5 of the 
Order and after such consultation, if any, with foreign authorities as 
the Secretary of State, in consultation with the Secretary of the 
Treasury, the Secretary of the Department of Homeland Security and the 
Attorney General, deems appropriate in the exercise of his discretion, 
persons determined by the Director of OFAC, in consultation with the 
Departments of State, Homeland Security and Justice, to assist in, 
sponsor, or provide financial, material, or technological support for, 
or financial or other services to or in support of, such acts of
