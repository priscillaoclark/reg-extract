that the continued existence of the receiverships will serve no useful 
purpose. Consequently, notice is given that the receiverships shall be 
terminated, to be effective no sooner than thirty days after the date 
of this notice. If any person wishes to comment concerning the 
termination of any of the receiverships, such comment must be made in 
writing, identify the receivership to which the comment pertains, and 
be sent within thirty days of the date of this notice to: Federal 
Deposit Insurance Corporation, Division of Resolutions and 
Receiverships, Attention: Receivership Oversight Section, 600 North 
Pearl, Suite 700, Dallas, TX 75201. No comments concerning the 
termination of the above-mentioned receiverships will be considered 
which are not sent within this timeframe.
