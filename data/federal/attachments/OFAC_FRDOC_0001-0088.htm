reexportation of agricultural commodities, medicine, and medical 
devices to the Specified Areas of Sudan, as well as the conduct of 
related transactions. The Specified Areas of Sudan are defined as 
Southern Sudan, Southern Kordofan/Nuba Mountains State, Blue Nile 
State, Abyei, Darfur, and marginalized areas in and around Khartoum.

Background

    The Sudanese Sanctions Regulations, 31 CFR part 538 (the ``SSR''), 
were promulgated to implement Executive Order 13067 of November 3, 1997 
(62 FR 59989, November 5, 1997) (``E.O. 13067''), in which the 
President declared a national emergency with respect to the policies 
and actions of the Government of Sudan.
    To deal with that emergency, E.O. 13067 imposed comprehensive trade 
sanctions with respect to Sudan and blocked all property and interests 
in property of the Government of Sudan in the United States or within 
the possession or control of United States persons.
    Subsequently, on October 13, 2006, the President signed the Darfur 
Peace and Accountability Act of 2006 (Pub. L. 109-344, 120 Stat. 1869) 
(``DPAA'') and issued Executive Order 13412 of October 13, 2006 (71 FR 
61369, October 17, 2006) (``E.O. 13412''). The DPAA and E.O. 13412, 
inter alia, exempt the Specified Areas of Sudan from certain 
prohibitions set forth in E.O. 13067, and define the term Specified 
Areas of Sudan to include Southern Sudan, Southern Kordofan/Nuba 
Mountains State, Blue Nile State, Abyei, Darfur, and marginalized areas 
in and around Khartoum. While E.O. 13412 exempted the Specified Areas 
of Sudan from certain prohibitions in E.O. 13067, it continued the 
country-wide blocking of the Government of Sudan's property and 
interests in property and imposed a new country-wide prohibition on

[[Page 46362]]

transactions relating to Sudan's petroleum or petrochemical industries. 
E.O. 13412 also removed the regional Government of Southern Sudan from 
the definition of the term Government of Sudan set forth in E.O. 13067. 
OFAC issued amendments to the SSR implementing E.O. 13412 on October 
31, 2007 (72 FR 61513, October 31, 2007).
    OFAC today is further amending the SSR to resolve a tension between 
E.O. 13412 and the DPAA on the one hand, and the Trade Sanctions Reform 
and Export Enhancement Act of 2000 (22 U.S.C. 7201-7211) (``TSRA'') on 
the other. Pursuant to E.O. 13412 and the DPAA, most trade and related 
activities--other than trade with the Government of Sudan or relating 
to Sudan's petroleum or petrochemical industries--are allowed with the 
Specified Areas of Sudan. These Specified Areas, however, remained 
subject to regulations promulgated pursuant to section 906(a)(1) of 
TSRA, which provides that the export of agricultural commodities, 
medicine, and medical devices to the government of a country that has 
been determined by the Secretary of State, under section 6(j) of the 
Export Administration Act of 1979, 50 U.S.C. App. 2405(j) (the 
``EAA''), to have repeatedly provided support for acts of international 
terrorism, or to any entity in such a country, shall be made pursuant 
to one-year licenses issued by the United States government.
    Because Sudan has been determined by the Secretary of State to be a 
country that has repeatedly provided support for acts of international 
terrorism pursuant to section 6(j) of the EAA, the entire country 
remained subject to TSRA's licensing requirements under the SSR. The 
overlap of TSRA with E.O. 13412 and the DPAA--as previously implemented 
in the SSR--resulted in the requirement that OFAC authorize the export 
of agricultural and medical items to the Specified Areas of Sudan, even 
though no OFAC authorization was required to export most other items to 
those areas.
    Therefore, in view of the underlying policy objectives and findings 
concerning the Specified Areas of Sudan that resulted in the 
elimination of most of the previous economic sanctions against these 
areas within Sudan, including export sanctions analogous to those 
covered by TSRA, OFAC has determined that specific licenses for TSRA-
related transactions with respect to the Specified Areas of Sudan 
should no longer be required. Instead, OFAC is authorizing such 
transactions through a general license, set forth at SSR Sec.  
538.523(a)(2), provided that such transactions do not involve any 
property or interests in property of the Government of Sudan or relate 
to the petroleum or petrochemical industries in Sudan. In accordance 
with the requirements set forth in section 906(a)(1) of TSRA, this 
general license covers exports shipped within the twelve-month period 
beginning on the date of the signing of the export contract. In 
addition, each year by the anniversary of its effective date on 
September 9, 2009, OFAC will determine whether to revoke the general 
license. Unless revoked, the general license will remain in effect. 
However, specific licenses for TSRA-related transactions with respect 
to the Government of Sudan, to any individual or entity in an area of 
Sudan other than the Specified Areas of Sudan, or to persons in third 
countries purchasing specifically for resale to the foregoing are still 
required.
    Existing prohibitions and safeguards satisfy TSRA's requirement 
that procedures be in place to deny the general license for exports to 
entities within Sudan promoting international terrorism. For instance, 
the requirement that no U.S. person engage in any transaction with 
anyone on OFAC's List of Specially Designated Nationals and Blocked 
Persons, including persons designated under the terrorism programs 
administered by OFAC, provides a mechanism for denying TSRA-related 
exports to certain entities within the Specified Areas of Sudan. In 
addition, if it deems necessary, OFAC may amend, modify, or revoke the 
new general license pursuant to Sec.  501.803 of the Reporting, 
Procedures and Penalties Regulations, 31 CFR part 501 (the ``RPPR''), 
which set forth standard reporting and recordkeeping requirements and 
license application and other procedures governing transactions 
regulated pursuant to other parts of 31 CFR chapter V. Section 538.502 
of the SSR similarly provides OFAC with the authority to exclude any 
person, property, or transaction from the operation of the general 
license or to restrict the applicability of the general license with 
respect to any persons, property, or transactions. Finally, the 
requirement that all U.S. persons maintain records of any transaction 
subject to OFAC-administered sanctions for a period of not less than 
five years pursuant to RPPR Sec.  501.601, and OFAC's authority to 
obtain these records pursuant to RPPR Sec.  501.602, allow OFAC to 
monitor activities under the general license in order to determine 
whether it should exercise these authorities.
    Those transactions now authorized by the general license set forth 
at Sec.  538.523(a)(2) of the SSR include the sale, exportation, and 
reexportation of agricultural commodities, medicine, and medical 
devices, the financing of and payment for such sales, and the brokering 
of TSRA sales. However, the transshipment or transit of TSRA-related 
exports through areas of Sudan other than the Specified Areas of Sudan, 
and any related financial transactions that are routed through 
depository institutions located in an area of Sudan other than the 
Specified Areas, remain prohibited under Sec. Sec.  538.417 and 538.418 
of the SSR.

Public Participation

    Because the amendment of 31 CFR part 538 involves a foreign affairs 
function, the provisions of Executive Order 12866 and the 
Administrative Procedure Act (5 U.S.C. 553), requiring notice of 
proposed rulemaking, opportunity for public participation, and delay in 
effective date, are inapplicable. Because no notice of proposed 
rulemaking is required for this rule, the Regulatory Flexibility Act (5 
U.S.C. 601-612) does not apply.

Paperwork Reduction Act

    The collections of information related to 31 CFR part 538 are 
contained in 31 CFR part 501 (the ``Reporting, Procedures and Penalties 
Regulations''). Pursuant to the Paperwork Reduction Act of 1995 (44 
U.S.C. 3507), those collections of information have been approved by 
the Office of Management and Budget under control number 1505-0164. An 
agency may not conduct or sponsor, and a person is not required to 
respond to, a collection of information unless the collection of 
information displays a valid control number.

destruction or missile proliferation. Executory contracts entered into 
pursuant to paragraph (b)(2) of this section prior to the issuance of 
the one-year specific license described in this paragraph shall be
