SECURITIES AND EXCHANGE COMMISSION

[SEC File No. 270-658, OMB Control No. 3235-0716]


Proposed Collection; Comment Request; Extension: Form C

Upon Written Request Copies Available From: Securities and Exchange 
Commission, Office of FOIA Services, 100 F Street NE, Washington, DC 
20549-2736

    Notice is hereby given that, pursuant to the Paperwork Reduction 
Act of 1995 (44 U.S.C. 3501 et seq.), the Securities and Exchange 
Commission (``Commission'') is soliciting comments on the collection of 
information summarized below. The Commission plans to submit this 
existing collection of information to the Office of Management and 
Budget for extension and approval.
    Form C (17 CFR 239.900) is used by issuers offering securities in 
reliance on the crowdfunding exemption in Section 4(a)(6) (15 U.S.C. 
77d(a)(6)) of the Securities Act of 1933 (``Securities Act'') (15 
U.S.C. 77a et seq.) Form C will also be used by issuers that have 
completed transactions in reliance on Section 4(a)(6) to file annual 
reports or to provide notice of the termination of reporting 
obligations.. The information collected is intended to create a 
framework for the filing and disclosure requirements of Title III 
Section 4A of the Jumpstart Our Business Startups Act (Pub. L. 112-106, 
126 Stat. 306) to implement the exemption from Securities Act 
registration for offerings made in reliance on Section 4(a)(6). Form C 
takes approximately 49.9696 hours per response and is filed by 
approximately 3,476 respondents. We estimate that 75% of the 49.9696 
hours per response (37.4772 hours) is prepared by the issuer for a 
total annual reporting burden of 130,271 hours (37.4772 hours per 
response x 3, 476 responses).
    Written comments are invited on: (a) whether this proposed 
collection of information is necessary for the proper performance of 
the functions of the agency, including whether the information will 
have practical utility; (b) the accuracy of the agency's estimate of 
the burden imposed by the collection of information; (c) ways to 
enhance the quality, utility, and clarity of the information collected; 
and (d) ways to minimize the burden of the collection of information on 
respondents, including through the use of automated collection 
techniques or other forms of information technology. Consideration will 
be given to comments and suggestions submitted in writing within 60 
days of this publication by April 15, 2024.
    An agency may not conduct or sponsor, and a person is not required 
to respond to, a collection of information unless it displays a 
currently valid control number.
    Please direct your written comment to David Bottom, Director/Chief 
Information Officer, Securities and Exchange Commission, c/o John 
Pezzullo, 100 F Street NE, Washington, DC 20549 or send an email to:

Assistant Secretary.
