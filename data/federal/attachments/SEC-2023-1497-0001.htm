SECURITIES AND EXCHANGE COMMISSION

[Release No. IA-6507]


Notice of Intention To Cancel Registration Pursuant to the 
Investment Advisers Act of 1940

    Notice is given that the Securities and Exchange Commission (the 
``Commission'') intends to issue an order, pursuant to section 203(h) 
of the Investment Advisers Act of 1940 (the ``Act''), cancelling the 
registration of Vista Financial Advisors, LLC File No. 801-122832, 
hereinafter referred to as the ``registrant.''
    Section 203(h) provides, in pertinent part, that if the Commission 
finds that any person registered under section 203, or who has pending 
an application for registration filed under that section, is no longer 
in existence, is not engaged in business as an investment adviser, or 
is prohibited from registering as an investment adviser under section 
203A, the Commission shall by order, cancel the registration of such 
person.
    The registrant indicated on its most recent Form ADV filing that it 
is a large advisory firm that has regulatory assets under management of 
$100 million or more.\1\ The Commission believes, based on the facts it 
has, that the registrant did not at the time of the Form ADV filing, 
and does not currently, maintain the required assets under management 
to remain registered with the Commission, nor does it appear eligible 
to register with the Commission pursuant to any other provision of the 
Advisers Act. Accordingly, the Commission believes that reasonable 
grounds exist for a finding that this registrant is no longer eligible 
to be registered with the Commission as an investment adviser and that 
the registration should be cancelled pursuant to section 203(h) of the 
Act.
---------------------------------------------------------------------------

    \1\ Section 203A of the Act generally prohibits an investment 
adviser from registering with the Commission unless it meets certain 
requirements. See Advisers Act section 203A(a); 17 CFR 275.203A-2.
---------------------------------------------------------------------------

    Notice is also given that any interested person may, by January 12, 
2024, at 5:30 p.m., submit to the Commission in writing a request for a 
hearing on the cancellation, accompanied by a statement as to the 
nature of his or her interest, the reason for such request, and the 
issues, if any, of fact or law proposed to be controverted, and he or 
she may request that he or she be notified if the Commission should 
order a hearing thereon. Any such communication should be emailed to 
the Commission's Secretary at <a href="/cdn-cgi/l/email-protection#beeddbddccdbcadfccc7cd93f1d8d8d7dddbfecddbdd90d9d1c8"><span class="__cf_email__" data-cfemail="f1a2949283948590838882dcbe9797989294b1829492df969e87">[email&#160;protected]</span></a>.
    At any time after January 12, 2024, the Commission may issue an 
order cancelling the registration, upon the basis of the information 
stated above, unless an order for a hearing on the cancellation shall 
be issued upon request or upon the Commission's own motion. Persons who 
requested a hearing, or who requested to be advised as to whether a 
hearing is ordered, will receive any notices and orders issued in this 
matter, including the date of the hearing (if ordered) and any 
postponements thereof.
    Any adviser whose registration is cancelled under delegated 
authority may appeal that decision directly to the Commission in 
accordance with rules 430 and 431 of the Commission's rules of practice 
(17 CFR 201.430 and 431).
