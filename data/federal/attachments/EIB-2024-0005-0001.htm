SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION: The ``Report of Premiums Payable for 
Exporters Only'' form is used by exporters to report and pay premiums 
on insured shipments to various foreign buyers under the terms of the 
policy and to certify that premiums have been correctly computed and 
remitted. Individual transactions that an exporter may have with the 
same foreign borrower can be sub-totaled and entered as a single line 
item for the specific month provided the length of payment term is 
identical. The use of sub-totals reduces the administrative burden on 
the exporter. The `Report of Premiums Payable for Exporters Only' is 
used by the Bank to determine the eligibility of the shipment(s) and to 
calculate the premium due to Ex-Im Bank for its support of the 
shipment(s) under its insurance program.
    No changes are being made to the form in use.
