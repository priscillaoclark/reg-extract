Background

    On September 23, 2001, the President issued Executive Order 13224 
(the ``Order'') pursuant to the International Emergency Economic Powers 
Act, 50 U.S.C. 1701-1706, and the United Nations Participation Act of 
1945, 22 U.S.C. 287c, imposing economic sanctions on persons who 
commit, threaten to commit, or support acts of terrorism. The President 
identified in the Annex to the Order various individuals and entities 
as subject to the economic sanctions. The Order authorizes the 
Secretary of the Treasury, in consultation with the Secretary of State, 
the Attorney General, and (pursuant to Executive Order 13284) the 
Secretary of the Department of Homeland Security, to designate 
additional persons or entities determined to meet certain criteria set 
forth in Executive Order 13224.
    On April 19, 2002, one additional person and, on August 28, 2002, 
twelve additional entities were designated by the Secretary of the 
Treasury. The Department of the Treasury's Office of Foreign Assets 
Control has determined that these three individuals no longer meet the 
criteria for designation under the Order and are appropriate for 
removal from the list of Specially Designated Nationals and Blocked
