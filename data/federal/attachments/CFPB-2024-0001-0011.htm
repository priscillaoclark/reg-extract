SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION:

I. Background

    Section 3 of the charter of the Board states that: The purpose of 
the CAB is outlined in section 1014(a) of the Dodd-Frank Act, which

exercise of its functions under the Federal consumer financial laws'' 
and ``provide information on emerging practices in the consumer 
financial products or services industry, including regional trends, 
concerns, and other relevant information.''
    To carry out the CAB's purpose, the scope of its activities shall 
include providing information, analysis, and recommendations to the 
CFPB. The CAB will generally serve as a vehicle for trends and themes 
in the consumer finance marketplace for the CFPB. Its objectives will 
include identifying and assessing the impact on consumers and other 
market participants of new, emerging, and changing products, practices, 
or services.
