Trading Commission, Three Lafayette Centre, 1155 21st Street NW,

SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION: The CFTC's advisory committees were created 
to provide input and make recommendations to the Commission on a 
variety of regulatory and market issues that affect the integrity and 
competitiveness of the United States (U.S.) derivatives markets. The 
committees facilitate communication between the Commission and U.S. 
derivatives markets, trading firms, market participants, and end users. 
The CFTC currently has five advisory committees. The Agricultural 
Advisory Committee, Global Markets Advisory Committee, Market Risk 
Advisory Committee, and the Technology Advisory Committee are 
discretionary committees under the Federal Advisory Committee Act 
(FACA), 5 U.S.C. 1001 et seq. The Energy and Environmental Markets 
Advisory Committee was established by the Dodd-Frank Wall Street Reform 
and Consumer Protection Act, Public Law 111-203, and subsequently 
codified in the Commodity Exchange Act, 7 U.S.C. 1 et seq., at 7 U.S.C. 
2(a)(15), and is not subject to the FACA. The Commission also 
establishes and maintains subcommittees that report to advisory 
committees as needed. Advisory committee and subcommittee members are 
generally representatives, but depending on the issues to be addressed, 
the Commission will appoint special government employees (SGEs) and 
officials from other Federal agencies from time to time. The CFTC 
identifies candidates for advisory committee and subcommittee 
membership through a variety of methods, including public requests for 
nominations; recommendations from existing advisory committee members; 
consultations with knowledgeable persons outside the CFTC (industry, 
consumer groups, other state or Federal government agencies, academia, 
etc.); requests to be represented received from individuals and 
organizations; and Commissioners' and CFTC staff's professional 
knowledge of those experienced in the derivatives and other underlying 
commodities markets. The CFTC collects and maintains information on 
CFTC advisory committee and subcommittee applicants and members, and 
those who make recommendations for committee or subcommittee 
memberships, or otherwise interact with the CFTC regarding its advisory 
committees and subcommittees. The records are used for the 
administration of the CFTC's advisory committees and subcommittees.

SYSTEM NAME AND NUMBER:
    Advisory Committees CFTC 58.

SECURITY CLASSIFICATION:
    Unclassified.

SYSTEM LOCATION:
    This system is located at the Commodity Futures Trading Commission, 
Three Lafayette Centre, 1155 21st Street NW, Washington, DC 20581. 
Records may also be located at the regional offices in Chicago, 
Illinois; Kansas City, Missouri; and New York, New York. The system 
will be hosted on the CFTC's cloud and data center computing 
infrastructure. Duplicate versions of some or all system information 
may be at satellite locations where the CFTC has granted direct access 
to support CFTC operations, system backup, emergency preparedness, and/
or continuity of operations.

SYSTEM MANAGER(S):
    Committee Management Officer and Deputy General Counsel for General 
Law, <a href="/cdn-cgi/l/email-protection#0a6c6b696b4a696c7e69246d657c"><span class="__cf_email__" data-cfemail="0a6c6b696b4a696c7e69246d657c">[email&#160;protected]</span></a>, Office of the General Counsel, Commodity Futures 
Trading Commission, Three Lafayette Centre, 1155 21st Street NW,

committee and subcommittee applicants and members, and those who make

subcommittees. The records are used for the administration of the 
CFTC's advisory committees and subcommittees. For example, as part of 
the member evaluation and selection process, the CFTC collects and 
maintains information to determine the experience and expertise of 
potential advisory committee and subcommittee members, ensure that the 
membership on a committee or subcommittee is balanced, and ensure that 
committee and subcommittee members are properly designated as 
representatives or SGEs. The records are also used to document and 
manage committee and subcommittee memberships, to receive public input 
regarding the work of the advisory committees and subcommittees, and to 
complete the annual mandatory FACA report to the General Services 
Administration (GSA).
