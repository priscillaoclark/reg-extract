October 15, 2010.
    Pursuant to Section 11A(a)(3) of the Securities Exchange Act of 
1934 (``Act'') \1\ and Rule 608 thereunder,\2\ notice is hereby given 
that on October 7, 2010, C2 Options Exchange, Incorporated (``C2'' or 
``Exchange'') filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission 
(``Commission'') an amendment to the Options Order Protection and 
Locked/Crossed Market Plan (``Plan'').\3\ The amendment proposes to add 
C2 as a Participant \4\ to the Plan. The Commission is publishing this 
notice to solicit comments on the proposed rule change from interested 
persons.
---------------------------------------------------------------------------

    \1\ 15 U.S.C. 78k-1(a)(3).
    \2\ 17 CFR 242.608.
    \3\ On July 30, 2009, the Commission approved a national market 
system plan relating to Options Order Protection and Locked/Crossed 
Markets proposed by Chicago Board Options Exchange, Incorporated 
(``CBOE''), International Securities Exchange, LLC (``ISE''), The 
NASDAQ Stock Market LLC (``Nasdaq''), NASDAQ OMX BX, Inc. (``BOX''), 
NASDAQ OMX PHLX, Inc. (``Phlx''), NYSE Amex, LLC (``NYSE Amex''), 
and NYSE Arca, Inc. (``NYSE Arca''). See Securities Exchange Act 
Release No. 60405 (July 30, 2009), 74 FR 39362 (August 6, 2009). See 
also Securities Exchange Act Release No. 61546 (February 19, 2010), 
75 FR 8762 (February 25, 2010) (adding BATS Exchange, Inc. 
(``BATS'') as a Participant).
    \4\ The term ``Participant'' is defined as an Eligible Exchange 
whose participation in the Plan has become effective pursuant to 
Section 3(c) of the Plan.
---------------------------------------------------------------------------

I. Description and Purpose of the Amendment

    The current Participants in the Linkage Plan are CBOE, BATS, ISE, 
Nasdaq, BOX, Phlx, NYSE Amex, and NYSE Arca. The proposed amendment to 
the Plan would add C2 as a Participant in the Plan. C2 has submitted a 
signed copy of the Plan to the Commission in accordance with the 
procedures set forth in the Plan regarding new Participants. Section 
3(c) of the Plan provides for the entry of new Participants to the 
Plan. Specifically an Eligible Exchange \5\ may become a Participant in 
the Plan by: (i) Executing a copy of the Plan, as then in effect; (ii) 
providing each current Participant with a copy of such executed Plan; 
(iii) effecting an amendment to the Plan, as specified in Section 4(b) 
of the Plan.
---------------------------------------------------------------------------

    \5\ Section 2(6) of the Plan defines an ``Eligible Exchange'' as 
a national securities exchange registered with the Commission 
pursuant to Section 6(a) of the Act, 15 U.S.C. 78f(a), that: (a) Is 
a ``Participant Exchange'' in the Options Clearing Corporation 
(``OCC'') (as defined in OCC By-laws, Section VII); (b) is a party 
to the Options Price Reporting Authority (``OPRA'') Plan (as defined 
in the OPRA Plan, Section 1); and (c) if the national securities 
exchange chooses not to become part to this Plan, is a participant 
in another plan approved by the Commission providing for comparable 
Trade-Through and Locked and Crossed Market protection. C2 has 
represented that it has met the requirements for being considered an 
Eligible Exchange. See letter from Edward J. Joyce, President and 
Chief Operating Officer, C2, to Elizabeth Murphy, Secretary, 
Commission, dated October 6, 2010.
---------------------------------------------------------------------------

    Section 4(b) of the Plan puts forth the process by which an 
Eligible Exchange may effect an amendment to the Plan. Specifically, an 
Eligible Exchange must: (a) Execute a copy of the Plan with the only 
change being the addition of the new participant's name in Section 3(a) 
of the Plan; and (b) submit the executed Plan to the Commission. The 
Plan then provides that such an amendment will be effective when the 
amendment is approved by the Commission or otherwise becomes effective 
pursuant to Section 11A of the Act and Rule 608 thereunder.

II. Effectiveness of the Proposed Linkage Plan Amendment

    The foregoing proposed Plan amendment has become effective pursuant 
to Rule 608(b)(3)(iii) of the Act \6\ because it involves solely 
technical or ministerial matters. At any time within sixty days of the 
filing of this amendment, the Commission may summarily abrogate the 
amendment and require that it be refiled pursuant to paragraph (b)(1) 
of Rule 608,\7\ if it appears to the Commission that such

action is necessary or appropriate in the public interest, for the 
protection of investors or the maintenance of fair and orderly markets, 
to remove impediments to, and perfect the mechanisms of, a national 
market system or otherwise in furtherance of the purposes of the Act.
