COMMODITY FUTURES TRADING COMMISSION


Agency Information Collection Activities: Notice of Intent To 
Renew Collection 3038-0107, Generic Clearance for the Collection of 
Qualitative Feedback on Agency Service Delivery

AGENCY: Commodity Futures Trading Commission.

ACTION: Notice.

-----------------------------------------------------------------------

SUMMARY: The Commodity Futures Trading Commission (``Commission'' or 
``CFTC'') is announcing an opportunity for public comment on the 
renewal of collection of certain information by the Commission's Office 
of Customer Education and Outreach (``OCEO''). Under the Paperwork 
Reduction Act (``PRA''), Federal agencies are required to publish 
notice in the Federal Register concerning each proposed or renewal of a 
collection of information and to allow 60 days for public comment. The 
Commission is soliciting comments for the renewal of its generic 
information collection that will help the CFTC satisfy responsibilities 
under the Dodd-Frank Wall Street Reform and Consumer Protection Act 
(``Dodd-Frank Act''), found in Section 748 of the Dodd-Frank Act. The 
generic information collection will provide the OCEO a means to gather 
qualitative consumer and stakeholder feedback in an efficient, timely 
manner to facilitate service delivery.

DATES: Comments must be submitted on or before February 27, 2023.

ADDRESSES: You may submit comments, identified by ``Generic Clearance 
for the Collection of Qualitative Feedback on Agency Service 
Delivery,'' and Collection Number 3038-0107, by any of the following

email: <a href="/cdn-cgi/l/email-protection#1074626564787562767f627450737664733e777f66"><span class="__cf_email__" data-cfemail="0f6b7d7a7b676a7d69607d6b4f6c697b6c21686079">[email&#160;protected]</span></a>, and refer to OMB Control No. 3038-0107.

SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION: Under the PRA, Federal agencies must obtain 
approval from the Office of Management and Budget (``OMB'') for each 
collection of information they conduct or sponsor. ``Collection of 
Information'' is defined in 44 U.S.C. 3502(3) and 5 CFR 1320.3 and 
includes agency requests or requirements that members of the public 
submit reports, keep records, or provide information to a third party. 
Section 3506(c)(2)(A) of the PRA, 44 U.S.C. 3506(c)(2)(A), requires 
Federal agencies to provide a 60-day notice in the Federal Register 
concerning each proposed collection of information, including each 
proposed extension of an existing collection of information, before 
submitting the collection to OMB for approval. To comply with this 
requirement, the CFTC is publishing notice of the proposed collection 
of information listed below. An agency may not conduct or sponsor, and 
a person is not required to respond to, a collection of information 
unless it displays a currently valid OMB control number.

    Title: Generic Clearance for Collection of Qualitative Feedback on 
Agency Service Delivery (OMB Control No. 3038-0107). This is a request 
for an extension of a currently approved information collection.
    Abstract: In accordance with section 748 of the Dodd-Frank Act, the 
OCEO anticipates undertaking a variety of service delivery focused 
activities over the next few years that include consumer outreach and 
information-sharing with stakeholders which are responsive to 
stakeholders' needs and sensitive to changes in the market. The 
proposed information collection activity will use similar methods for 
information collection or otherwise share common elements, and provide 
a means to gather qualitative customer and stakeholder feedback in an 
efficient, timely manner. By qualitative feedback we mean information 
that provides useful information on perceptions and opinions. The 
solicitation of information on delivery of consumer services will 
address such areas as appropriate messages, effective message delivery 
methods, effective event outreach tactics and characteristics, new 
outreach program ideas and content, and current consumer beliefs, 
psychographics and social norms that will assist the agency in 
developing outreach and communications campaigns. Since these systems 
will use similar methods for information collection or otherwise share 
common elements, the OCEO is proposing a generic clearance for this 
process, which will allow the OCEO to implement these systems and meet 
the obligations of the PRA without the delays of the normal clearance 
process. Collection methods may include focus groups and surveys as 
well as other relevant collection methods that meet the conditions 
appropriate for a generic clearance as outlined below. The OCEO will 
only submit a collection for approval under this generic clearance if 
it meets the following conditions:
    <bullet> The collections are voluntary;
    <bullet> The collections are low-burden for respondents (based on 
considerations of total burden hours, total number of respondent, or 
burden-hours per respondent) and are low-cost for both the respondents 
and the Federal Government;
    <bullet> The collections are non-controversial and do not raise 
issues of concern to other Federal agencies;
    <bullet> Any collection is targeted to the solicitation of opinions 
from respondents who have experience with the program or may have 
experience with the program in the near future;
    <bullet> Personally identifiable information (PII) is collected 
only to the extent necessary and is not retained;
    <bullet> Information gathered is intended to be used only 
internally for general service improvement and program management 
purposes and is not intended for release outside of the Commission (if 
released, the Commission must indicate the qualitative nature of the 
information);
    <bullet> Information gathered will not be used for the purpose of 
substantially informing influential policy decisions; and
    <bullet> Information gathered will yield qualitative information; 
the collections will not be designed or expected to yield statistically 
reliable results or used as though the results are generalizable to the 
population of study.
    With respect to the collection of information, the Commission 
invites comments on:
    <bullet> Whether the proposed collection of information is 
necessary for the proper performance of the functions of the 
Commission, including whether the information will have a practical 
use;
    <bullet> The accuracy of the Commission's estimate of the burden of 
the proposed collection of information, including the validity of the 
methodology and assumptions used;
    <bullet> Ways to enhance the quality, usefulness, and clarity of 
the information to be collected; and
    <bullet> Ways to minimize the burdens of collection of information 
on those who are to respond, including through the use of appropriate 
automated electronic, mechanical, or other technological collection 
techniques or other forms of information technology, e.g., permitting 
electronic submission of responses.
    You should submit only information that you wish to make available 
publicly. If you wish the Commission to consider information that you 
believe is exempt from disclosure under the Freedom of Information Act, 
a petition for confidential treatment of the exempt information may be 
submitted according to the procedures established in Sec.  145.9 of the 
Commission's regulations.\1\

    \1\ 17 CFR 145.9.
---------------------------------------------------------------------------

    The Commission reserves the right, but shall have no obligation, to 
review, pre-screen, filter, redact, refuse or remove any or all of your 
submission from <a href="https://www.cftc.gov">https://www.cftc.gov</a> that it may deem to be 
inappropriate for publication, such as obscene language. All 
submissions that have been redacted or removed that contain comments on 
the merits of the Information Collection Request will be retained in 
the public comment file and will be considered as required under the 
Administrative Procedure Act and other applicable laws, and may be 
accessible under the Freedom of Information Act.

estimated to be as follows:
