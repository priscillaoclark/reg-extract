I. Self-Regulatory Organization's Statement of the Terms of the 
Substance of the Proposed Rule Change

    NASDAQ proposes to modify pricing for NASDAQ members using the 
NASDAQ Market Center. NASDAQ will implement the proposed change on 
September 7, 2010. The text of the proposed rule change is available at 
<A HREF="http://frwebgate.access.gpo.gov/cgi-bin/leaving.cgi?from=leavingFR.html&log=linklog&to=http://nasdaq.cchwallstreet.com/">http://nasdaq.cchwallstreet.com/</A>, at NASDAQ's principal office, and at 
the Commission's Public Reference Room.

II. Self-Regulatory Organization's Statement of the Purpose of, and 
Statutory Basis for, the Proposed Rule Change

    In its filing with the Commission, NASDAQ included statements 
concerning the purpose of and basis for the proposed rule change and 
discussed any comments it received on the proposed rule change. The 
text of these statements may be examined at the places specified in 
Item IV below. NASDAQ has prepared summaries, set forth in Sections A, 
B, and C below, of

[[Page 57092]]

the most significant aspects of such statements.

A. Self-Regulatory Organization's Statement of the Purpose of, and 
Statutory Basis for, the Proposed Rule Change

1. Purpose
    NASDAQ is modifying its fee for routing orders to the New York 
Stock Exchange (``NYSE'') closing auction to reflect a change recently 
made by NYSE to the fee that it charges for orders executed in the 
auction.\3\ As a result of the change, the fee charged by NASDAQ for 
DOT Orders for stocks priced at $1.00 or more that execute in the NYSE 
closing process as a ``market-at-the-close'' or ``limit-at-the-close'' 
order will increase from $0.0007 to $0.00085 per share executed. 
Similarly, for most ``market-at-the-close'' or ``limit-at-the-close'' 
orders executed at NYSE, NYSE has raised the fee from $0.0007 to 
$0.00085 per share executed.\4\
---------------------------------------------------------------------------

    \3\ Securities Exchange Act Release No. 62826 (September 1, 
2010) (SR-NYSE-2010-63).
    \4\ The exception is for stocks with a share price less than 
$1.00, for which NYSE formerly charged the lesser or [sic] $0.0007 
per share executed or 0.3% of the transaction cost, and for which it 
will now charge the lesser of $0.00085 per share executed or 0.3% of 
the transaction cost. NASDAQ charges a uniform fee of 0.3% of the 
transaction cost for all routed orders for stocks with a share price 
of less than $1.00.
---------------------------------------------------------------------------

2. Statutory Basis

    NASDAQ believes that the proposed rule change is consistent with 
the provisions of Section 6 of the Act,\5\ in general, and with Section 
6(b)(4) of the Act,\6\ in particular, in that it provides for the 
equitable allocation of reasonable dues, fees and other charges among 
members and issuers and other persons using any facility or system 
which NASDAQ operates or controls. The change reflects an increase in 
the fee that NYSE charges to NASDAQ when it routes orders to the NYSE 
closing auction, and is equitably allocated to members based on their 
use of orders that route to NYSE.

    \5\ 15 U.S.C. 78f.
    \6\ 15 U.S.C. 78f(b)(4).
---------------------------------------------------------------------------

B. Self-Regulatory Organization's Statement on Burden on Competition

    NASDAQ does not believe that the proposed rule change will result 
in any burden on competition that is not necessary or appropriate in 
furtherance of the purposes of the Act, as amended.

C. Self-Regulatory Organization's Statement on Comments on the Proposed 
Rule Change Received from Members, Participants, or Others

    Written comments were neither solicited nor received.

III. Date of Effectiveness of the Proposed Rule Change and Timing for 
Commission Action

    The foregoing rule change has become effective pursuant to Section 
19(b)(3)(A)(ii) of the Act.\7\ At any time within 60 days of the filing 
of the proposed rule change, the Commission summarily may temporarily 
suspend such rule change if it appears to the Commission that such 
action is necessary or appropriate in the public interest, for the 
protection of investors, or otherwise in furtherance of the purposes of 
the Act. If the Commission takes such action, the Commission shall 
institute proceedings to determine whether the proposed rule should be 
approved or disapproved.
