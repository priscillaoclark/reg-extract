Background

    On August 4, 2003, the Office of Foreign Assets Control (``OFAC'') 
promulgated the Rough Diamonds Control Regulations, 31 CFR part 592 
(the ``Regulations''), to implement Executive Order 13312 (``E.O. 
13312'') of July 29, 2003. E.O. 13312 was issued to implement the Clean 
Diamond Trade Act (Pub. L. 108-19) and the multilateral Kimberley 
Process Certification Scheme for rough diamonds (KPCS). The Regulations 
were amended on September 23, 2004, to revise certain reporting 
requirements (69 FR 56936). Today, OFAC is further amending the 
Regulations to enhance the compilation of statistical data relating to 
the importation and exportation of rough diamonds.
    Specifically, OFAC is amending the Regulations by adding an 
additional note to the definition of the term Controlled through the 
Kimberley Process Certification Scheme, contained in section 592.301. 
Section 592.301 sets forth requirements that apply, as appropriate, to 
the importation into, or exportation from, the United States of any 
shipment of rough diamonds. The new note to this section explains that 
the U.S. Customs and Border Protection (CBP) will not release custody 
of an importation of rough diamonds, unless the import conforms with 
the CBP's formal entry for consumption requirements, as defined in the 
CBP regulations (see 19 CFR 141.0a(f)). In addition, OFAC is amending 
the Regulations to add a new section 592.502, which requires all 
importers and exporters of rough diamonds to file an annual report with 
the Department of State detailing their import, export and stockpile 
information.

Public Participation

    Because the amendments to the Regulations involve a foreign affairs 
function, Executive Order 12866 and the provisions of the 
Administrative Procedure Act (5 U.S.C. 553) requiring notice of 
proposed rulemaking, opportunity for public participation, and delay in 
effective date are inapplicable. Because no notice of proposed 
rulemaking is required for this rule, the Regulatory Flexibility Act (5 
U.S.C. 601-612) does not apply.

Paperwork Reduction Act

    The collections of information related to 31 CFR Part 592 are 
contained in 31 CFR Part 501 (the ``Reporting, Procedures and Penalties 
Regulations''). Pursuant to the Paperwork Reduction Act of 1995 (44 
U.S.C. 3507), those collections of information have been approved by 
the Office of Management and Budget under control number 1505-0198. An 
agency may not conduct or sponsor, and a person is not required to 
respond to, a collection of information unless the collection of 
information displays a valid control number.
