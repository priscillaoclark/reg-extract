SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION: The Board's GSIB surcharge rule establishes 
a methodology to identify global systemically important bank holding 
companies in the United States (GSIBs) based on indicators that are 
correlated with systemic importance.\1\ Under the GSIB surcharge rule, 
a firm must calculate its GSIB score using a specific formula (method 
1). Method 1 uses five equally weighted categories that are correlated 
with systemic importance--size, interconnectedness, cross-
jurisdictional activity, substitutability, and complexity--and 
subdivided into twelve systemic indicators.
---------------------------------------------------------------------------

    \1\ See 12 CFR 217.402, 217.404.
---------------------------------------------------------------------------

    A firm divides its own measure of each systemic indicator by an 
aggregate global indicator amount. A firm's method 1 score is the sum 
of its weighted systemic indicator scores expressed in basis points. A 
firm that calculates a method 1 score of 130 basis points or more is 
identified as a GSIB under the GSIB surcharge rule. The GSIB surcharge 
for a firm is the higher of the GSIB surcharge determined under method 
1 and a second method, method 2, which is calculated based on measures 
of size, interconnectedness, cross-jurisdictional activity, complexity, 
and the firm's reliance on short-term wholesale funding.\2\
---------------------------------------------------------------------------

    \2\ Method 2 uses similar inputs to those used in method 1, but 
replaces the substitutability category with a measure of a firm's 
use of short-term wholesale funding. In addition, method 2 is 
calibrated differently from method 1. See 12 CFR 217.405.
---------------------------------------------------------------------------

    The aggregate global indicator amounts used in the score 
calculation under method 1 are based on data collected by the Basel 
Committee on Banking Supervision (BCBS). The BCBS amounts are 
determined based on the sum of the systemic indicator amounts as 
reported by the 75 largest U.S. and foreign banking organizations as 
measured by the BCBS, and any other banking organization that the BCBS 
includes in its sample total for that year. The BCBS publicly releases 
these amounts, denominated in euros, each year.\3\ Pursuant to the GSIB 
surcharge rule, the Board publishes the aggregate global indicator 
amounts each year as denominated in U.S. dollars using the euro-dollar 
exchange rate provided by the BCBS.\4\ Specifically, to determine the 
2023 aggregate global indicator amounts, the Board uses the year-end 
2022 euro-denominated indicator

[[Page 87427]]

amounts published by the BCBS and multiplies each of the euro-
denominated indicator amounts by 1.0666, the euro to U.S. dollar spot 
exchange rate on December 31, 2022.\5\
---------------------------------------------------------------------------

    \3\ The data used by the Board are available on the BCBS website 
at <a href="https://www.bis.org/bcbs/gsib/denominators.htm">https://www.bis.org/bcbs/gsib/denominators.htm</a>.
    \4\ 12 CFR 217.404(b)(1)(i)(B); see also 80 FR 49082, 49086-87 
(August 14, 2015). In addition, the Board maintains the GSIB 
Framework Denominators on its website, available at <a href="https://www.federalreserve.gov/supervisionreg/basel/denominators.htm">https://www.federalreserve.gov/supervisionreg/basel/denominators.htm</a>.

217.404(b)(1)(i)(B) of the GSIB surcharge rule are:
