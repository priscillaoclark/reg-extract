I. Self-Regulatory Organization's Statement of the Terms of Substance 
of the Proposed Rule Change

    Cboe EDGA Exchange, Inc. (the ``Exchange'' or ``EDGA Equities'') 
proposes to amend its Fees Schedule. The text of the proposed rule 
change is provided in Exhibit 5.
    The text of the proposed rule change is also available on the 
Exchange's website (<a href="http://markets.cboe.com/us/equities/regulation/rule_filings/edga/">http://markets.cboe.com/us/equities/regulation/rule_filings/edga/</a>), at the Exchange's Office of the Secretary, and at 
the Commission's Public Reference Room.

II. Self-Regulatory Organization's Statement of the Purpose of, and 
Statutory Basis for, the Proposed Rule Change

    In its filing with the Commission, the Exchange included statements 
concerning the purpose of and basis for the proposed rule change and 
discussed any comments it received on the proposed rule change. The 
text of these statements may be examined at the places specified in 
Item IV below. The Exchange has prepared summaries, set forth in 
sections A, B, and C below, of the most significant aspects of such 
statements.

[[Page 99941]]

A. Self-Regulatory Organization's Statement of the Purpose of, and 
Statutory Basis for, the Proposed Rule Change

1. Purpose
    The Exchange proposes to amend its fee schedule to adopt fees for 
Dedicated Cores.\3\
---------------------------------------------------------------------------

    \3\ The Exchange initially introduced Dedicated Cores and 
corresponding pricing on March 1, 2024 (SR-CboeEDGA-2024-008). On 
March 20, 2024, the Exchange refiled the proposed fees (SR-CboeEDGA-
2024-009). The Exchange amended the Dedicated Cores fees on April 1, 
2024 (SR-CboeEDGA-2024-012). On April 12, 2024, the Exchange 
withdrew that filing and submitted SR-CboeEDGA2024-014. On May 13, 
2024, the Exchange withdrew SR-CboeEDGA-2024-009. On June 3, 2024, 
the Exchange also withdrew SR-CboeEDGA-014 and SR-CboeEDGA-2024-020. 
On August 1, the Exchange withdrew that filing and submitted SR-
CboeEDGA-2024-032. On business date September 30, 2024, the Exchange 
withdrew that filing and submitted SR-CboeEDGA-2024-039. On November 
26, 2024, the Exchange withdrew that filing and submitted this 
filing.
---------------------------------------------------------------------------

    By way of background, the Exchange recently began to allow Users 
\4\ to assign a Single Binary Order Entry (``BOE'') logical order entry 
port \5\ to a single dedicated Central Processing Unit (CPU Core) 
(``Dedicated Core''). Historically, CPU Cores had been shared by 
logical order entry ports (i.e., multiple logical ports from multiple 
firms may connect to a single CPU Core). Use of Dedicated Cores 
however, can provide reduced latency, enhanced throughput, and improved 
performance since a firm using a Dedicated Core is utilizing the full 
processing power of a CPU Core instead of sharing that power with other 
firms. This offering is completely voluntary and is available to all 
Users that wish to purchase Dedicated Cores. Users may utilize BOE 
logical order entry ports on shared CPU Cores, either in lieu of, or in 
addition to, their use of Dedicated Core(s). As such, Users are able to 
operate across a mix of shared and dedicated CPU Cores which the 
Exchange believes provides additional risk and capacity management. 
Further, Dedicated Cores are not required nor necessary to participate 
on the Exchange and as such Users may opt not to use Dedicated Cores at 
all.
---------------------------------------------------------------------------

    \4\ A User may be either a Member or Sponsored Participant. The 
term ``Member'' shall mean any registered broker or dealer that has 
been admitted to membership in the Exchange, limited liability 
company or other organization which is a registered broker or dealer 
pursuant to Section 15 of the Act, and which has been approved by 
the Exchange. A Sponsored Participant may be a Member or non-Member 
of the Exchange whose direct electronic access to the Exchange is 
authorized by a Sponsoring Member subject to certain conditions. See 
Exchange Rule 11.3.
    \5\ Users may currently connect to the Exchange using a logical 
port available through an application programming interface 
(``API''), such as the Binary Order Entry (``BOE'') protocol. A BOE 
logical order entry port is used for order entry.
---------------------------------------------------------------------------

    The Exchange proposes to assess the following monthly fees for 
Users that wish to use Dedicated Cores and adopt a maximum limit. 
First, the Exchange proposes to provide up to two Dedicated Cores to 
all Users who wish to use Dedicated Cores, at no additional cost. For 
the use of more than two Dedicated Cores, the Exchange proposes to 
assess the following fees: $650 per Dedicated Core for 3-10 Dedicated 
Cores; $850 per Dedicated Core for 11-15 Dedicated Cores; and $1,050 
per Dedicated Core for 16 or more Dedicated Cores. The proposed fees 
are progressive and the Exchange proposes to include the following 
example in the Fees Schedule to provide clarity as to how the fees will 
be applied. Particularly, the Exchange will provide the following 
example: if a User were to purchase 11 Dedicated Cores, it will be 
charged a total of $6,050 per month ($0 * 2 + $650 * 8 + $850 * 1). The 
Exchange also proposes to make clear in the Fees Schedule that the 
monthly fees are assessed and applied in their entirety and are not 
prorated. The Exchange notes the current standard fees assessed for BOE 
Logical Ports, whether used with Dedicated or shared CPU cores, will 
remain applicable and unchanged.\6\
---------------------------------------------------------------------------

    \6\ The Exchange currently assesses $550 per port per month. 
Port fees will also continue to be assessed on the first two 
Dedicated Cores that Users receive at no additional cost. See Cboe 
EDGA Equities Fee Schedule.
---------------------------------------------------------------------------

    Since the Exchange currently has a finite amount of physical space 
in its data centers in which its servers (and therefore corresponding 
CPU Cores) are located, the Exchange also proposes to prescribe a 
maximum limit on the number of Dedicated Cores that Users may purchase 
each month. The purpose of establishing these limits is to manage the 
allotment of Dedicated Cores in a fair manner and to prevent the 
Exchange from being required to expend large amounts of resources in 
order to provide an unlimited number of Dedicated Cores. The Exchange 
previously established a limit for Members of a maximum number of 60 
Dedicated Cores and Sponsoring Members a limit of a maximum number of 
25 Dedicated Cores for each of their Sponsored Access relationships.\7\ 
The Exchange has since been able to procure additional servers with CPU 
Cores and also has a better understanding of User demand relative to 
its available space and available Dedicated Cores since the initial 
launch of Dedicated Cores. After seeing increased User demand, the 
Exchange proposed to increase that cap and provided that Members will 
be limited to a maximum number of 80 Dedicated Cores and Sponsoring 
Members will be limited to a maximum number of 35 Dedicated Cores for 
each of their Sponsored Access relationships.\8\ The Exchange noted at 
that time that it would continue monitoring Dedicated Core interest by 
all Users and allotment availability with the goal of increasing these 
limits to meet Users' needs if and when the demand is there and/or the 
Exchange is able to accommodate additional Dedicated Cores. Since then, 
the Exchange has determined that it is able to accommodate an increased 
cap relative to current demand. As such, the Exchange proposes to 
increase the cap to 120 Dedicated Cores for Members, effective December 
1, 2024.\9\ Sponsoring Members will continue to be limited to a maximum 
of 35 Dedicated Cores for each of their Sponsored Access 
relationships.\10\
---------------------------------------------------------------------------

    \7\ See Securities Exchange Act Release No. 100300 (June 10, 
2024), 89 FR 50653 (June 14, 2024) (SR-CboeEDGA-2024-020).
    \8\ See Securities Exchange Act Release No. 101304 (October 10, 
2024), 89 FR 83748 (October 17, 2024) (SR-CboeEDGA-2024-039).
    \9\ The prescribed maximum quantity of Dedicated Cores for 
Members applies regardless of whether that Member purchases the 
Dedicated Cores directly from the Exchange and/or through a Service 
Bureau. In a Service Bureau relationship, a customer allows its MPID 
to be used on the ports of a technology provider, or Service Bureau. 
One MPID may be allowed on several different Service Bureaus.
    \10\ The fee tier(s) applicable to Sponsoring Members are 
determined on a per Sponsored Access relationship basis and not on 
the combined total of Dedicated Cores across Sponsored Users. For 
example, under the proposed changes, a Sponsoring Member that has 
three Sponsored Access relationships is entitled to a total of 105 
Dedicated Cores for those 3 Sponsored Access relationships but would 
be assessed fees separately based on the 35 Dedicated Cores for each 
Sponsored User (instead of combined total of 105 Dedicated Cores). 
For example, a Sponsoring Member with 3 Sponsored Access 
relationships would pay $30,450 per month if each Sponsored Access 
relationship purchased the maximum 35 Dedicated Cores. More 
specifically, the Sponsoring Member would be provided 2 Dedicated 
Cores at no additional cost for each Sponsored User under Tier 1 
(total of 6 Dedicated Cores at no additional cost) and provided an 
additional 8 Dedicated Cores at $650 each for each Sponsored User, 5 
Dedicated Cores at $850 each for each Sponsored User and 20 
Dedicated Cores at $1,050 each for each Sponsored User (combined 
total of 99 additional Dedicated Cores).
---------------------------------------------------------------------------

2. Statutory Basis
    The Exchange believes the proposed rule change is consistent with 
the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 (the ``Act'') and the rules and 
regulations thereunder applicable to the Exchange and, in particular, 
the requirements of Section 6(b) of the Act.\11\ Specifically, the 
Exchange believes the proposed rule change is consistent with the 
Section

[[Page 99942]]

6(b)(5) \12\ requirements that the rules of an exchange be designed to 
prevent fraudulent and manipulative acts and practices, to promote just 
and equitable principles of trade, to foster cooperation and 
coordination with persons engaged in regulating, clearing, settling, 
processing information with respect to, and facilitating transactions 
in securities, to remove impediments to and perfect the mechanism of a 
free and open market and a national market system, and, in general, to 
protect investors and the public interest. Additionally, the Exchange 
believes the proposed rule change is consistent with the Section 
6(b)(5) \13\ requirement that the rules of an exchange not be designed 
to permit unfair discrimination between customers, issuers, brokers, or 
dealers. The Exchange also believes the proposed rule change is 
consistent with Section 6(b)(4) \14\ of the Act, which requires that 
Exchange rules provide for the equitable allocation of reasonable dues, 
fees, and other charges among its Members and other persons using its 
facilities.

---------------------------------------------------------------------------

    The Exchange believes the proposal is reasonable because the 
Exchange is offering any User who wishes to utilize Dedicated Cores up 
to two Dedicated Cores at no additional cost. For example, of the Users 
that currently maintain Dedicated Cores, 32% maintain only 1 or 2 
Dedicated Cores and therefore pay no additional fees. The Exchange 
believes the proposed fees are reasonable because Dedicated Cores 
provide a valuable service in that it can provide reduced latency, 
enhanced throughput, and improved performance compared to use of a 
shared CPU Core since a firm using a Dedicated Core is utilizing the 
full processing power of a CPU Core. The Exchange also emphasizes 
however, that the use of Dedicated Cores is not necessary for trading 
and as noted above, is entirely optional. Users can also continue to 
access the Exchange through shared CPU Cores at no additional cost. 
Indeed, only 21% of the Exchange's Members currently use Dedicated 
Cores and as noted above, of those 21%, 32% take only 1 or 2 Dedicated 
Cores at no additional cost. Depending on a firm's specific business 
needs, the proposal enables Users to choose to use Dedicated Cores in 
lieu of, or in addition to, shared CPU Cores (or as emphasized, not use 
Dedicated Cores at all). If a User finds little benefit in having 
Dedicated Cores based on its business model and trading strategies, or 
determines Dedicated Cores are not cost-efficient for its needs or does 
not provide sufficient value to the firm, such User may continue its 
use of the shared CPU Cores, unchanged. The Exchange also has no plans 
to eliminate shared CPU Cores nor to require Users to purchase 
Dedicated Cores.
    The Exchange has seen general interest in Dedicated Cores from a 
variety of market participants, with varying size and business models. 
Such market participants include proprietary trading firms (who tend to 
be more latency sensitive), as well as sell-side market participants 
and buy-side market participants (who tend to be less latency 
sensitive). For background, proprietary trading firms utilize their own 
capital to trade without taking outside money from clients. Due to the 
nature of their respective businesses, the Exchange has classified 
proprietary trading firms as latency sensitive, and other groups, such 
as buy-side hedge funds, sell-side banks and sell-side non-banks (such 
as agency brokers) as non-latency sensitive. Proprietary trading firms' 
strategies may range from, marketing making, to relative value trading 
and arbitrage--these all rely on profiting from general market activity 
and, generally, requires faster entry and exit into trades and 
positions making proprietary trading firms more latency sensitive than 
other market segments. Buy-side hedge funds, banks and agency brokers 
are not as latency sensitive as strategy for hedge funds is based on 
overall long-term positioning in the market and banks and agency 
brokers may profit from commissions of customer order flow; both are 
generally strategies that are not reliant on speed to the same extent 
proprietary trading firms are. Further, Members have various reasons 
for obtaining Dedicated Cores. Some Members for example, may be seeking 
to further reduce latency, whereas others may use Dedicated Cores as a 
general risk mitigation by siloing their respective activity. Of 
further note, only 47% of Members that are propriety trading firms (who 
again, generally tend to be more latency sensitive) utilize Dedicated 
Cores, and of that 47%, 33% are only utilizing the 1 to 2 free 
Dedicated Cores available to all Users. As mentioned above, some non-
latency sensitive firms have chosen to also adopt Dedicated Cores. 15% 
of Members that are not latency sensitive utilize Dedicated Cores, and 
of that 15%, 33% are only utilizing the 1 to 2 free Dedicated Cores 
available to all Users.
    The lack of universal, or even widespread, adoption by all such 
users therefore demonstrates that purchasing Dedicated Cores is not 
effectively a requirement to compete for any one type of market 
participant, including latency sensitive market participants. Instead, 
Dedicated Cores are an optional and voluntary connectivity offering, 
which market participants are free to choose whether or not to utilize 
based on whether they meet their unique business needs. Moreover, the 
Exchange has received overwhelming positive feedback and support for 
Dedicated Cores, with some Members even noting that they have moved 
more of their order flow to the Exchange and its affiliated equities 
exchanges (the ``Equities Exchanges'') as they have noticed both better 
fills and greater consistency of order execution at the Equities 
Exchanges. This demonstrates that despite any incurred costs for 
Members that choose to purchase Dedicated Cores, it is ultimately a net 
win for them as they benefit from better execution. The Exchange 
believes it also demonstrates that Members find the proposed fees to be 
both reasonable and have benefited from purchasing or, at alternatively 
benefiting from the proposed one or two free Dedicated Cores available 
at no additional cost. The Exchange believes this is shown by both the 
level of demand for Dedicated Cores and the feedback from market 
participants, including as described above. The Exchange also believes 
it's notable that no negative comment letters in connection with the 
proposed pricing have been received since the Exchange first filed 
proposed fees for Dedicated Cores back on March 1, 2024. Additionally, 
as noted earlier, Members can (and many have) decide that utilizing 
even a free Dedicated Core is not needed for their business. 
Ultimately, this is a business decision that each Member must make and 
is best suited to determine and will ultimately depend on the 
priorities and strategies of that Member's respective business needs.
    The Exchange also believes that the proposed Dedicated Core fees 
are equitable and not unfairly discriminatory because they continue to 
be assessed uniformly to similarly situated users in that all Users who 
choose to purchase Dedicated Cores will be subject to the same proposed 
tiered fee schedule. Moreover, all Users are entitled to up to 2 
Dedicated Cores at no additional cost and as previously discussed, 32% 
of all Users that take Dedicated Cores (including both latency 
sensitive and non-latency sensitive Users) take only 1 or 2 Dedicated 
Cores at no additional cost. The Exchange believes the proposed 
ascending fee structure is also reasonable, equitable

[[Page 99943]]

and not unfairly discriminatory as it is designed so that firms that 
use a higher allotment of the Exchange's finite number of Dedicated 
Cores pay higher rates, rather than placing that burden on market 
participants that have more modest needs who will have the flexibility 
of obtaining Dedicated Cores at lower price points in the lower tiers. 
As such, the proposed fees do not favor certain categories of market 
participants in a manner that would impose a burden on competition; 
rather, the ascending fee structure reflects the (finite) resources 
consumed by the various needs of market participants--that is, the 
lowest Dedicated Core consuming Users pay the least, and highest 
Dedicated Core consuming Users pay the most. Other exchanges similarly 
assess higher fees to those that consume more Exchange resources.\15\ 
Moreover, those consuming more Dedicated Cores do so if they find a 
benefit in having higher quantities of Dedicated Cores based on their 
respective business needs. The proposed tier structure is also designed 
to encourage firms to manage their needs in a fair manner and to 
prevent the Exchange from being required to expend large amounts of 
resources in order to provide an additional number of Dedicated Cores. 
Moreover, as discussed above and in more detail below, the Exchange 
cannot currently offer an unlimited number of Dedicated Cores due in 
part to physical space constraints in the third-party data center. The 
Exchange believes the proposed ascending fee structure is therefore 
another appropriate means, in conjunction with an established cap, to 
manage this finite resource and ensure the resource is apportioned more 
fairly.
---------------------------------------------------------------------------

    \15\ See e.g., Cboe U.S. Options Fees Schedule, BZX Options, 
Options Logical Port Fees, Ports with Bulk Quoting Capabilities.
---------------------------------------------------------------------------

    The Exchange believes it is reasonable to limit the number of 
Dedicated Cores Users can purchase because the Exchange has a finite 
amount of space in its third-party data centers to accommodate CPU 
cores, including Dedicated Cores. The Exchange must also take into 
account timing and cost considerations in procuring additional 
Dedicated Cores and related hardware such as servers, switches, optics 
and cables, as well as the readiness of the Exchange's data center to 
accommodate additional Dedicated Cores in the Exchange's respective 
Order Handler Cabinets.\16\ Moreover, procuring data center space has 
grown to be more challenging than it was five years ago with the 
increased demand for data center space. For example, the U.S. 
colocation data center market has doubled in size in just four years. 
In addition to the Exchange's rollout of Dedicated Cores, the Exchange 
is mindful of its other business areas and the need to continue to be 
mindful of its existing, external restraints in procuring additional 
space in this area. The Exchange has, and will continue to, monitor 
market participant demand and space availability and endeavor to adjust 
the limit if and when the Exchange is able to acquire additional space 
and power within the third-party data centers and/or additional CPU 
Cores to accommodate additional Dedicated Cores.\17\ The Exchange 
monitors its capacity and data center space and thus is in the best 
place to determine these limits and modify them as appropriate in 
response to changes to this capacity and space, as well as market 
demand. Indeed, since the launch of Dedicated Cores on February 26, 
2024, the Exchange has already increased the prescribed maximum limit 
three times not including the increase proposed herein, as a result of 
evaluating the demand relative to Dedicated Cores availability and 
procuring additional physical space and CPU Cores.\18\ The proposed 
increased limits continue to apply uniformly to similarly situated 
market participants (i.e., all Members are subject to the same limit 
and all Sponsored Participants are subject to the same limit, 
respectively). The Exchange believes it's not unfairly discriminatory 
to provide for different limits for different types of Users. For 
example, the Exchange believes it's not unfairly discriminatory to 
provide for an initial lower limit to be allocated for Sponsored 
Participants because unlike Members, Sponsored Participants are able to 
access the Exchange without paying a Membership Fee. Members also have 
more regulatory obligations and risk that Sponsored Participants do 
not. For example, while Sponsored Participants must agree to comply 
with the Rules of the Exchange, it is the Sponsoring Member of that 
Sponsored Participant that remains ultimately responsible for all 
orders entered on or through the Exchange by that Sponsored 
Participant. The industry also has a history of applying fees 
differently to Members as compared to Sponsored Participants.\19\ 
Lastly, the Exchange believes its proposed maximum limits, and 
distinction between Members and Sponsored Users, is another appropriate 
means to help the Exchange manage its allotment of Dedicated Cores and 
better ensure this finite resource is apportioned fairly.
---------------------------------------------------------------------------

    \16\ The Exchange notes that it cannot currently convert shared 
CPU cores into Dedicated Cores.
    \17\ The Exchange does not expect any Users that take Dedicated 
Cores to be at or near the maximum limits and the average number of 
Dedicated Cores used for the Exchange is 11.

---------------------------------------------------------------------------

B. Self-Regulatory Organization's Statement on Burden on Competition

    The Exchange does not believe that the proposed rule change will 
impose any burden on intramarket competition that is not necessary in 
furtherance of the purposes of the Act because the proposed tiered fee 
structure will apply equally to all similarly situated Users that 
choose to use Dedicated Cores. As discussed above, Dedicated Cores are 
optional and Users may choose to utilize Dedicated Cores, or not, based 
on their views of the additional benefits and added value provided by 
utilizing a Dedicated Core. The Exchange believes the proposed fee will 
be assessed proportionately to the potential value or benefit received 
by Users with a greater number of Dedicated Cores and notes that Users 
may determine at any time to cease using Dedicated Cores. As discussed, 
Users can also continue to access the Exchange through shared CPU Cores 
at no additional cost. Finally, all Users will be entitled to two 
Dedicated Cores at no additional cost.
    Next, the Exchange believes the proposed rule change does not 
impose any burden on intermarket competition that is not necessary or 
appropriate in furtherance of the purposes of the Act. As previously 
discussed, the Exchange operates in a highly competitive market, 
including competition for exchange memberships. Market Participants 
have numerous alternative venues that they may participate on, 
including 15 other equities exchanges, as well as off-exchange venues, 
where competitive products are available for trading. Indeed, 
participants can readily choose to submit their order flow to other 
exchange and off-exchange venues if they deem fee levels at those other 
venues to be more favorable. Moreover, the Commission has repeatedly 
expressed its preference for competition over regulatory intervention 
in determining prices, products, and services in the securities 
markets. Specifically, in Regulation NMS, the

[[Page 99944]]

Commission highlighted the importance of market forces in determining 
prices and SRO revenues and, also, recognized that current regulation 
of the market system ``has been remarkably successful in promoting 
market competition in its broader forms that are most important to 
investors and listed companies.'' \20\ The fact that this market is 
competitive has also long been recognized by the courts. In 
NetCoalition v. Securities and Exchange Commission, the D.C. Circuit 
stated as follows: ``[n]o one disputes that competition for order flow 
is `fierce.' . . . As the SEC explained, `[i]n the U.S. national market 
system, buyers and sellers of securities, and the broker-dealers that 
act as their order-routing agents, have a wide range of choices of 
where to route orders for execution'; [and] `no exchange can afford to 
take its market share percentages for granted' because `no exchange 
possesses a monopoly, regulatory or otherwise, in the execution of 
order flow from broker dealers' . . . .''.\21\ Accordingly, the 
Exchange does not believe its proposed change imposes any burden on 
competition that is not necessary or appropriate in furtherance of the 
purposes of the Act.

Rule Change Received From Members, Participants, or Others

    The Exchange neither solicited nor received comments on the 
proposed rule change.

III. Date of Effectiveness of the Proposed Rule Change and Timing for 
Commission Action

    The foregoing rule change has become effective pursuant to Section 
19(b)(3)(A) of the Act \22\ and paragraph (f) of Rule 19b-4 \23\ 
thereunder. At any time within 60 days of the filing of the proposed 
rule change, the Commission summarily may temporarily suspend such rule 
change if it appears to the Commission that such action is necessary or 
appropriate in the public interest, for the protection of investors, or 
otherwise in furtherance of the purposes of the Act. If the Commission 
takes such action, the Commission will institute proceedings to 
determine whether the proposed rule change should be approved or 
disapproved.
