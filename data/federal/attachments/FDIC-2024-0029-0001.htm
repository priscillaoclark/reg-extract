    General Description of Collection: Part 354 of the FDIC regulations 
(part 354) establishes filing requirements for industrial banks or 
industrial loan companies (ILCs) and companies that are not subject to 
Federal consolidated supervision by the Federal Reserve Board but 
control an industrial bank or an ILC (covered company). Specifically, 
part 354 requires any covered company and industrial bank or ILC 
subsidiary of a covered company to enter into one or more written 
agreements with the FDIC. However, the requirements under part 354 do 
not apply to any industrial bank subsidiaries of covered companies that 
were subsidiaries of covered companies prior to the effective date of 
part 354--April 1, 2021. The requirements under part 354 give rise to 
this information collection.
    The total estimated annual burden for this information collection 
is 401 hours, which is a decrease of 56 hours from the 2021 information 
collection submission (457 hours). This decrease is a result of a 
reduction in the estimated annual number of respondents.
    Request for Comment: Comments are invited on: (a) Whether the 
collection of information is necessary for the proper performance of 
the FDIC's functions, including whether the information has practical 
utility; (b) the accuracy of the estimates of the burden of the 
information collection, including the validity of the methodology and 
assumptions used; (c) ways to enhance the quality, utility, and clarity 
of the information to be collected; and (d) ways to minimize the burden 
of the collection of information on respondents, including through the 
use of automated collection techniques or other forms of information 
technology. All comments will become a matter of public record.

Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation.

    Dated at Washington, DC, on April 12, 2024.

Assistant Executive Secretary.
