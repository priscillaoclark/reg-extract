Final Approval under OMB Delegated Authority of the Extension for Three 
Years, Without Revision, of the Following Information Collection

    Collection title: Recordkeeping and Disclosure Requirements 
Associated with CFPB's Regulation Z.
    Collection identifier: FR Z.
    OMB control number: 7100-0199.
    General description of collection: The Truth in Lending Act (TILA) 
and Regulation Z require creditors to provide consumers with 
disclosures about the costs, terms, and related information regarding a 
wide range of credit products for personal, family, or household 
purposes. Depending on the credit product, required disclosures include 
information that must be provided at the time of the consumer's 
application for credit, at consummation (for closed-end credit) or 
account-opening (for open-end credit), and throughout the term of the 
loan. The TILA and Regulation Z also contain rules concerning 
recordkeeping and credit advertising.
    The FR Z is the Board's information collection associated with the 
Consumer Financial Protection Bureau's (CFPB's) Regulation Z. FR Z is 
used to promote the informed use of credit by consumers for personal, 
family, or household purposes by requiring these disclosures about the 
terms and costs of these products, as well as ensuring that consumers 
are provided with timely information on the nature and costs of the 
residential real estate settlement process.
    Frequency: Event-generated.
    Respondents: State member banks with assets of $10 billion or less 
that are not affiliated with an insured depository institution with 
assets over $10 billion (irrespective of the consolidated assets of any 
holding company); non-depository affiliates of such state member banks; 
and non-depository affiliates of bank holding companies that are not 
affiliated with an insured depository institution with assets over $10 
billion.
    Total estimated number of respondents: 3,695.
    Total estimated annual burden hours: 387,079.
    Current actions: On June 7, 2024, the Board published a notice in 
the Federal Register (89 FR 48645) requesting public comment for 60 
days on the extension, without revision, of the FR Z. The comment 
period for this notice expired on August 6, 2024. The Board did not 
receive any comments.
