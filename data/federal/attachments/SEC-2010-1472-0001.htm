SECURITIES AND EXCHANGE COMMISSION

 
Submission for OMB Review; Comment Request

Upon Written Request, Copies Available From: Securities and Exchange 
Commission, Office of Investor Education and Advocacy, Washington, DC 
20549-0213.

Extension:
    Rule 17a-7; Sec File No. 270-147; OMB Control No. 3235-0131.

    Notice is hereby given that pursuant to the Paperwork Reduction Act 
of 1995 (44 U.S.C. 3501 et seq.), the Securities and Exchange 
Commission (``Commission'') has submitted to the Office of Management 
and Budget (``OMB'') a request for extension of the previously approved 
collection of information discussed below.
    Rule 17a-7 (17 CFR 240.17a-7) under the Securities Exchange Act of 
1934 (15 U.S.C. 78a et seq.) (``Exchange Act'') requires non-resident 
broker-dealers registered or applying for registration pursuant to 
Section 15 of the Exchange Act to maintain--in the United States--
complete and current copies of books and records required to be 
maintained under any rule adopted under the Exchange Act. 
Alternatively, Rule 17a-7 provides that non-resident broker-dealers may 
sign written undertakings to furnish the requisite books and records to 
the Commission upon demand.
    There are approximately 63 non-resident broker-dealers. Based on 
the Commission's experience in this area, it is estimated that the 
average amount of time necessary to preserve the books and records 
required by Rule 17a-7 is one hour per year. Accordingly, the total 
burden is 63 hours per year. With an average cost per hour of 
approximately $294, the total cost of compliance for the respondents is 
approximately $18,522 per year.
    An agency may not conduct or sponsor, and a person is not required 
to respond to, a collection of information unless it displays a 
currently valid control number.
    Comments should be directed to (i) Desk Officer for the Securities 
and Exchange Commission, Office of Information and Regulatory Affairs, 
Office of Management and Budget, Room 10102, New Executive Office 
Building, Washington, DC 20503, or by sending an e-mail to: <A HREF="mailto:Shagufta_Ahmed@omb.eop.gov">Shagufta_
Ahmed@omb.eop.gov</A>; and (ii) Jeff Heslop, Acting Director/Chief 
Information Officer, Securities and Exchange Commission, c/o Remi 
Pavlik-Simon, 6432 General Green Way, Alexandria, VA 22312, or send an 
e-mail to: <A HREF="mailto:PRA_Mailbox@sec.gov">PRA_Mailbox@sec.gov</A>. Comments must be submitted within 30 
days of this notice.

    Dated: September 20, 2010.
Florence E. Harmon,
Deputy Secretary.
