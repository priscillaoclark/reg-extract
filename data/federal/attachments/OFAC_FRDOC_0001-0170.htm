Background

    The Kingpin Act became law on December 3, 1999. The Kingpin Act 
establishes a program targeting the activities of significant foreign 
narcotics traffickers and their organizations on a worldwide basis with 
the objective of denying their businesses and agents access to the U.S. 
financial system and to the benefits of trade and transactions 
involving U.S. companies and individuals.
    The Kingpin Act blocks all property and interests in property, 
subject to U.S. jurisdiction, owned or controlled by significant 
foreign narcotics traffickers as identified by the President. In 
addition, the Secretary of the Treasury may in consultation with the 
Attorney General, the Director of the Central Intelligence Agency, the 
Director of the Federal Bureau of Investigation, the Administrator of 
the Drug Enforcement Administration, the Secretary of Defense, the 
Secretary of State, and the Secretary of Homeland Security, designate 
and block the property and interests in property, subject to U.S. 
jurisdiction, of persons he determines to be: (1) Materially assisting 
in, or providing financial or technological support for or to, or 
providing goods or services in support of, the international narcotics 
trafficking activities of a person designated pursuant to the Kingpin 
Act; (2) owned, controlled, or directed by, or acting for or on behalf 
of, a person designated pursuant to the Kingpin Act; or (3) playing a 
significant role in international narcotics trafficking.
    On October 19, 2010, OFAC identified 2 entities that are blocked 
pursuant to section 805(b) of the Foreign Narcotics Kingpin Designation 
Act.
