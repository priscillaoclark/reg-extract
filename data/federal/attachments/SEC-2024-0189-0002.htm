    \9\ The CAT NMS Plan defines ``Industry Member'' as ``a member 
of a national securities exchange or a member of a national 
securities association.'' See CAT NMS Plan, infra note 10, at 
Section 1.1.
    \10\ Unless otherwise specified, capitalized terms used in this 
rule filing are defined as set forth in the CAT NMS Plan. The CAT 
NMS Plan is a national market system plan approved by the Commission 
pursuant to Section 11A of the Act and the rules and regulations 
thereunder. See Securities Exchange Act Release No. 79318 (November 
15, 2016), 81 FR 84696 (November 23, 2016). The CAT NMS Plan 
functions as the limited liability company agreement of the jointly 
owned limited liability company formed under Delaware state law 
through which the Participants conduct the activities of the CAT 
(``Company''). On August 29, 2019, the Participants replaced the CAT 
NMS Plan in its entirety with the limited liability company 
agreement of a new limited liability company named Consolidated 
Audit Trail, LLC, which became the Company. See Securities Exchange 
Act Release No. 87149 (September 27, 2019), 84 FR 52905 (October 3, 
2019).
    \11\ 15 U.S.C. 78s(b)(3)(A). A proposed rule change may take 
effect upon filing with the Commission if it is designated by the 
exchange as ``establishing or changing a due, fee, or other charge 
imposed by the self-regulatory organization on any person, whether 
or not the person is a member of the self-regulatory organization.''

    Section 19(b)(2) of the Act \14\ provides that, after instituting 
proceedings, the Commission shall issue an order approving or 
disapproving a proposed rule change not later than 180 days after the 
date of publication of notice of filing of the proposed rule 
change.\15\ The Commission may, however, extend the period for issuing 
an order approving or disapproving the proposed rule change by not more 
than 60 days if the Commission determines that a longer period is 
appropriate and publishes the reasons for such determination.\16\ The

---------------------------------------------------------------------------

    The Commission is extending the 180-day time period for Commission 
action on each of the proposed rule changes. The Commission finds it 
appropriate to designate a longer period within which to issue an order 
approving or disapproving the proposed rule changes so that it has 
sufficient time to consider the proposed rule changes.
    Accordingly, the Commission, pursuant to Section 19(b)(2) of the 
Act,\17\ designates October 10, 2024 as the date by which the 
Commission shall either approve or disapprove the proposed rule changes 
(File Nos. SR-BOX-2024-03; SR-BX-2024-002; SR-C2-2024-002; SR-CBOE-
