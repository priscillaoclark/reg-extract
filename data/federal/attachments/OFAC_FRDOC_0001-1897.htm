alia, the International Emergency Economic Powers Act (50 U.S.C. 1701 
et seq.) (IEEPA), issued Executive Order (E.O.) 14068, ``Prohibiting 
Certain Imports, Exports, and New Investment With Respect to Continued 
Russian Federation Aggression'' (87 FR 14381, March 15, 2022). Among

Treasury, in consultation with the Secretary of State and the Secretary

    On December 22, 2023, the President, invoking the authority of, 
inter alia, IEEPA, issued E.O. 14114, ``Taking Additional Steps With 
Respect to the Russian Federation's Harmful Activities'' (88 FR 89271,

importation and entry into the United States, including importation for 
admission into a foreign trade zone located in the United States, of 
the following products of Russian Federation origin: fish, seafood, and 
preparations thereof; alcoholic beverages; non-industrial diamonds; and 
any other products of Russian Federation origin, as may be determined 
by the Secretary of the Treasury, in consultation with the Secretary of 
State and the Secretary of Commerce.
    On April 6, 2022, the President, invoking the authority of, inter 
alia, IEEPA, issued E.O. 14071 of April 6, 2022, ``Prohibiting New 
Investment in and Certain Services to the Russian Federation in 
Response to Continued Russian Federation Aggression'' (87 FR 20999, 
April 8, 2022). Among other prohibitions, section 1(a)(ii) of E.O. 
14071 prohibits the exportation, reexportation, sale, or supply, 
directly or indirectly, from the United States, or by a United States 
person, wherever located, of any category of services as may be 
determined by the Secretary of the Treasury, in consultation with the 
Secretary of State, to any person located in the Russian Federation.

Determination Pursuant to Section 1(a)(i)(A) of E.O. 14068

    On April 12, 2024, pursuant to delegated authority, the Director of 
OFAC, in consultation with the Department of State and the Department 
of Commerce, issued ``Determination Pursuant to Section 1(a)(i)(A) of 
Executive Order 14068,'' which determined that the prohibitions in 
section 1(a)(i)(A) of E.O. 14068 as amended shall apply to aluminum,
