    General Description of Collection: Section 18(c) of the Federal 
Deposit Insurance Act (FDI Act) requires an insured depository 
institution (IDI) that wishes to merge or consolidate with any other 
IDI or, either directly or indirectly, acquire the assets of, or assume 
liability to pay any deposits made in, any other IDI, to apply for the 
prior written approval of the responsible agency (the FDIC; the Board 
of Governors of the Federal Reserve (FRB); or the Office of the 
Comptroller of the Currency (OCC)).\1\ Section 18(c) further requires 
FDIC approval in connection with any merger transaction involving an 
IDI and a non-insured entity.
---------------------------------------------------------------------------

    \1\ 12 U.S.C. 1828(c). The FDIC is the responsible agency if the 
acquiring, assuming, or resulting bank is to be a State nonmember 
insured bank or a State savings association.
---------------------------------------------------------------------------

    The Interagency Bank Merger Act Application Form (Application Form) 
is used by the FDIC, the FRB, and the OCC for applications under 
section 18(c) of the FDI Act. The Application Form may be used for any 
merger transaction subject to section 18(c). There is a different level 
of burden for each of the two types of merger transactions, 
nonaffiliated and affiliated. An affiliate transaction refers to a 
merger, consolidation, other combination, or transfer of any deposit 
liabilities, between an IDI and another entity controlled by the same 
parent company, regardless of whether the other entity is FDIC-insured. 
It includes a business combination between an IDI and an affiliated 
interim institution. Applicants proposing affiliate transactions are 
not required to complete questions 12 through 14 of the Application 
Form. If the merging entities are not controlled by the same parent 
company, the merger transaction is considered nonaffiliated, and the 
applicant must complete the entire application form.
    The FDIC Supplement to the Interagency Bank Merger Act Application 
Form (Supplement) requires each applicant to provide information that 
delineates the relevant geographic market(s) and describes the 
competition in the relevant geographic market(s). The information 
collected focuses on the relevant geographic market(s) where the 
applicant and the entity to be acquired provide banking products or 
services. The Supplement includes specific instructions to facilitate a 
comprehensive competitive analysis relative to transactions between 
nonaffiliated entities.
    There is no change in the method or substance of the collection. 
The 62-hour decrease in burden hours is the result of updated data 
available.

Request for Comment

    Comments are invited on: (a) whether the collection of information 
is necessary for the proper performance of the FDIC's functions, 
including whether the information has practical utility; (b) the 
accuracy of the estimate of the burden of the information collection, 
including the validity of the methodology and assumptions used; (c) 
ways to enhance the quality, utility, and clarity of the information to 
be collected; and (d) ways to minimize the burden of the collection of 
information on respondents, including through the use of automated 
collection techniques or other forms of information technology. All 
comments will become a matter of public record.

Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation.
