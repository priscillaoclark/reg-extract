COMMODITY FUTURES TRADING COMMISSION


Renewal of the Global Markets Advisory Committee

AGENCY: Commodity Futures Trading Commission.

ACTION: Notice of renewal.

-----------------------------------------------------------------------

SUMMARY: The Commodity Futures Trading Commission (Commission) is 
publishing this notice to announce the renewal of the Global Markets 
Advisory Committee (GMAC). The Commission has determined that the 
renewal of the GMAC is necessary and in the public's interest, and the 
Commission has consulted with the General Services Administration's 
Committee Management Secretariat regarding the GMAC's renewal.

FOR FURTHER INFORMATION CONTACT: Keaghan Ames, GMAC Designated Federal 
Officer, at 202-418-5644 or <a href="/cdn-cgi/l/email-protection#177c767a7264577471637439707861"><span class="__cf_email__" data-cfemail="aec5cfc3cbddeecdc8dacd80c9c1d8">[email&#160;protected]</span></a>.

SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION: The GMAC's objectives and scope of 
activities shall be to conduct public meetings, and to submit reports 
and recommendations on matters of public concern to the Commission; 
financial market infrastructures; intermediaries including swap 
dealers; advisors, end-users, and other market participants; service 
providers; international standard setting bodies; regulators; and 
others interested in or affected by the regulatory challenges of global 
markets, which reflect the increasing interconnectedness of markets and 
the multinational nature of business. The GMAC will help the Commission 
to identify methods to improve both U.S. and international regulatory 
structures without unnecessary regulatory or operational impediments to 
global business and while still preserving core protections for 
customers and other market participants. The GMAC will also promote 
international engagement through its recommendations and make 
recommendations for appropriate international standards for regulating 
futures, swaps, options, and derivatives markets, as well as 
intermediaries. In addition, the GMAC will assist the Commission in 
assessing the impact of the Commission's international efforts and the 
initiatives of foreign regulators and market authorities, including the 
impact on U.S. markets and firms.
    The GMAC will operate for two years from the date of renewal unless 
the Commission directs that the GMAC terminate on an earlier date. A 
copy of the GMAC renewal charter has been filed with the Commission; 
the Senate Committee on Agriculture, Nutrition and Forestry; the House 
Committee on Agriculture; the Library of Congress; and the General 
Services Administration's Committee Management Secretariat. A copy of 
the renewal charter will be posted on the Commission's website at 
<a href="http://www.cftc.gov">www.cftc.gov</a>.

    Dated: August 16, 2022.
Christopher Kirkpatrick,
Secretary of the Commission.
