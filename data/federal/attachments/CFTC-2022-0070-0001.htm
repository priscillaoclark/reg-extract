SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION: The TAC was established to assist the 
Commission in identifying and understanding the impact and implications 
of technological innovation in the financial services, derivatives, and 
commodity (including digital-asset commodity) markets. The TAC may 
provide advice to the Commission on the appropriate level of investment 
in technology at the Commission to meet its surveillance and 
enforcement responsibilities and inform the Commission's consideration 
of technology-related issues to support the Commission's mission of 
ensuring the integrity of the markets and achievement of other public 
interest objectives. The TAC accomplishes its objectives through public 
meetings and Committee reports and recommendations. The duties of the 
TAC are solely advisory and include calling for reports and/or 
recommendations by the TAC or TAC subcommittee(s), adopting reports 
and/or recommendations, and transmitting reports and/or recommendations 
to the Commission. Determinations of actions to be taken and policy to 
be expressed with respect to the reports or recommendations of the TAC 
are made solely by the Commission.
    TAC members generally serve as representatives and provide advice 
reflecting the views and interests of the organizations and/or entities 
that actively participate in the financial services and commodity 
markets that the Commission oversees, or actively consider legal, risk, 
or other issues presented by those markets. The representative members 
serve as a vehicle for communication between the Commission and 
representatives within the viewpoint categories on technology issues 
affecting those markets. Depending on the issues faced, the Commission 
may, from time to time, appoint experts to serve as Special Government 
Employees (SGEs), or officials of other Federal agencies to serve, on 
the TAC. If nominated, SGEs will be asked to submit and complete a 
Confidential Financial Disclosure Report (OGE Form 450). Members will 
represent a wide range of perspectives and interests, and these may 
include the viewpoint categories listed below. The members will be 
selected to represent a balance of viewpoints that are necessary or 
appropriate to effectively address the issues to be considered by the 
TAC. Though the viewpoint categories and precise number of members in 
any category may vary over time, the Commission anticipates that the 
TAC will have no more than 40 members who may represent the following 
viewpoint categories: (i) market participants in the derivatives and 
commodities markets; (ii) financial technology providers; (iii) market 
infrastructure firms, like exchanges and clearinghouses; (iv) other 
segments of the derivatives and commodities

[[Page 57871]]

industries; (v) regulatory organizations, which may include self-
regulatory organizations; (vi) academia; and (vii) think tanks and 
public interest groups. The TAC has held at least one meeting per year. 
TAC members serve at the pleasure of the Commission. In addition, TAC 
members do not receive compensation or honoraria for their services, 
and they are not reimbursed for travel and per diem expenses. TAC 
members are appointed to two-, three-, or four-year terms.
    The Commission seeks members who will share their experiences and 
views on the opportunties and risks that may be associated with 
technological innovation, including in the derivatives and commodities 
industries, and ways that the Commission can utilize new or different 
technologies in carrying out its mission. To advise the Commission 
effectively, TAC members must have a high level of expertise and 
experience relating to technological innovation in the financial 
services, derivatives, or commodity (including digital-asset commodity) 
markets and the Commission's regulation of such markets, including from 
a historical perspective. To the extent practicable, the Commission 
will strive to select members reflecting wide ethnic, racial, gender, 
and age representation. TAC members should be open to participating in 
a public forum.
    The Commission invites the submission of nominations for TAC 
membership. Each nomination submission should include relevant 
information about the proposed member, such as the individual's name, 
title, and organizational affiliation, as well as information that 
supports the individual's qualifications to serve on the TAC. The 
submission should also include suggestions for topics for discussion at 
future TAC meetings as well as the name and email or mailing address of 
the person nominating the proposed member.
    Submission of a nomination is not a guarantee of selection as a 
member of the TAC. As noted in the TAC's Membership Balance Plan, the 
CFTC identifies members for the TAC through a variety of methods. Such 
methods may include public requests for nominations for membership; 
recommendations sought from existing or former advisory committee 
members; consultations with knowledgeable persons outside the CFTC 
(e.g., persons representing market participants, financial technology 
providers, market infrastructure firms, regulatory or self-regulatory 
organizations, academic institutions, think tanks, or public interest 
groups); requests to be represented received from individuals and 
organizations; and Commissioners' and CFTC staff's professional 
knowledge of those experienced in the financial services, derivatives, 
or commodity markets. The Office of Commissioner Goldsmith Romero, 
given the Commissioner's sponsorship of the TAC, plays a primary, but 
not exclusive, role in this process and makes recommendations regarding 
membership to the Commission. The Commission, by vote, authorizes 
proposed members to serve on the TAC.
    The Commission also invites submissions from the public regarding 
the topics on which the TAC should focus. In other words, topics that 
relate to the following:
    (a) the impact and implications of technological innovation in the 
financial services, derivatives, and commodity (including digital-asset 
commodity) markets;
    (b) the utilization of new technologies in financial services, 
derivatives, and commodity (including digital-asset commodity) markets, 
as well as by market professionals and market users; and/or
    (c) the utilization of technology at the Commission to meet its 
surveillance and enforcement responsibilities and inform the 
Commission's consideration of technology-related issues to support the 
Commission's mission of ensuring the integrity of the markets and 
achievement of other public interest objectives.
    Each topic submission should include the commenter's name and email 
or mailing address.
