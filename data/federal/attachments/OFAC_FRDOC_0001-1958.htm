Background

    On April 15, 2021, the President, invoking the authority of, inter 
alia, the International Emergency Economic Powers Act (50 U.S.C. 1701 
et seq.) (IEEPA), issued Executive Order (E.O.) 14024, ``Blocking 
Property With Respect To Specified Harmful Foreign Activities of the 
Government of the Russian Federation'' (86 FR 20249, April 19, 2022).
    On December 22, 2023, the President, invoking the authority of, 
inter alia, IEEPA, issued E.O. 14114, ``Taking Additional Steps With 
Respect to the Russian Federation's Harmful Activities'' (88 FR 89271, 
December 26, 2023). Among other things, E.O. 14114 amends E.O. 14024 to 
redesignate section 11 as section 12 and add a new section 11. Section 
11(a) of E.O. 14024, as amended, provides that the Secretary of the 
Treasury, in consultation with the Secretary of State, and with respect 
to subsection (a)(ii) of this section, in consultation with the 
Secretary of State and the Secretary of Commerce, is hereby authorized 
to impose on a foreign financial institution the sanctions described in 
subsection (b) of this section, upon determining that the foreign 
financial institution has met the criteria in section 11(a)(i) or 
section 11(a)(ii). Section 11(a)(ii) of E.O. 14024, as amended, 
authorizes the imposition of sanctions on a foreign financial 
institution that has conducted or facilitated any significant 
transaction or transactions, or provided any service, involving 
Russia's military-industrial base, including the sale, supply, or 
transfer, directly or indirectly, to the Russian Federation of any item 
or class of items as may be determined by the Secretary of the 
Treasury, in consultation with the Secretary of State and the Secretary 
of Commerce.
    E.O. 14114 also amends E.O. 14068 by striking subsection (a)(i) of 
section 1 of E.O. 14068 and inserting a new subsection (a)(i). 
Subsection (a)(i)(A) of E.O. 14068, as amended, provides that the 
importation and entry into the United States, including importation for 
admission into a foreign trade zone located in the United States, of 
the following products of Russian Federation origin: fish, seafood, and 
preparations thereof; alcoholic beverages; non-industrial diamonds; and 
any other products of Russian Federation origin, as may be determined 
by the Secretary of the Treasury, in consultation with the Secretary of 
State and the Secretary of Commerce is prohibited.
    Subsection (a)(i)(B) of E.O. 14068, as amended, provides that the 
importation and entry into the United States, including importation for 
admission into a foreign trade zone located in the United States, of 
categories of any of the following products as may be determined by the 
Secretary of the Treasury, in consultation with the Secretary of State, 
the Secretary of Commerce, and the Secretary of Homeland Security, that 
were mined, extracted, produced, or manufactured wholly or in part in 
the Russian Federation, or harvested in waters under the jurisdiction 
of the Russian Federation or by Russia-flagged vessels, notwithstanding 
whether such products have been incorporated or substantially 
transformed into other products outside of the Russian Federation: 
fish, seafood, and preparations thereof; diamonds; and any other such 
products as may be determined by the Secretary of the Treasury, in 
consultation with the Secretary of State, the Secretary of Commerce, 
and the Secretary of Homeland Security is prohibited.
    On December 22, 2023, pursuant to delegated authority, the Director 
of OFAC, in consultation with the Secretary of State and the Secretary 
of Commerce, issued a determination identifying certain items or 
classes of items pursuant to section 11(a)(ii) of E.O.14024, as amended 
by E.O. 14114. Also on December 22, 2023, pursuant to delegated 
authority, the Director of OFAC, in consultation with the Department of 
State, the Department of Commerce, and the Department of Homeland 
Security, issued a determination pursuant to sections 1(a)(i)(B), 1(b), 
and 5 of E.O. 14068 to determine that the prohibitions in section 
1(a)(i)(B) of E.O. 14068 shall apply to certain categories of fish, 
seafood, and preparations thereof. Additionally, on December 22, 2023, 
the Director of OFAC, in consultation with the Department of State and 
the Department of Commerce, re-issued an amended determination pursuant 
to sections 1(a)(i)(A), 1(b), and 5 of E.O. 14068 that had previously 
determined that the prohibitions in section 1(a)(i) of E.O. 14068 
applied to gold of Russian Federation origin. Each determination was 
made available on OFAC's website (<a href="https://ofac.treasury.gov">https://ofac.treasury.gov</a>) when it 
was issued. The text of these determinations is below.
