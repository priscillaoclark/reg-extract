PRA OMB submission, including the draft reporting form and 
instructions, supporting statement (which contains more detail about 
the information collection and burden estimates than this notice), and

Request for Comment on Information Collection Proposal

    The Board invites public comment on the following information 
collection, which is being reviewed under authority delegated by the 
OMB under the PRA. Comments are invited on the following:
    a. Whether the proposed collection of information is necessary for 
the proper performance of the Board's functions, including whether the 
information has practical utility;
    b. The accuracy of the Board's estimate of the burden of the 
proposed information collection, including the validity of the

Proposal Under OMB Delegated Authority To Extend for Three Years, 
Without Revision, the Following Information Collection

    Collection title: Quarterly Report of Interest Rates on Selected 
Direct Consumer Installment Loans and the Quarterly Report of Credit 
Card Plans.
    Collection identifier: FR 2835 and FR 2835a.
    OMB control number: 7100-0085.
    General description of collection: The FR 2835 collects information 
on interest rates on loans for new vehicles and loans for other 
consumer goods and personal expenses from a sample of commercial banks. 
The FR 2835a collects information on interest rates, finance charges, 
and loan balances for credit card accounts from a sample of commercial 
banks. The data from these reports help the Board analyze current 
household financial conditions and the implications of these conditions 
for household spending and, as such, these data provide valuable input 
to the monetary policymaking process. The

data are also used to create aggregate statistics on consumer loan 
terms that are published in the Federal Reserve's monthly statistical 
releases, G.19 Consumer Credit and G.20 Finance Companies, and in the 
Federal Reserve Bulletin. Some of the aggregates are used by the Board 
in the calculation of the aggregate household debt service and 
financial obligations ratios for the Federal Reserve's quarterly 
Household Debt Service and Financial Obligations Ratios statistical 
release and by the Bureau of Economic Analysis to calculate interest 
paid by households as part of the National Income and Product Accounts.
    Frequency: Quarterly.
    Respondents: The FR 2835 panel comprises a sample of commercial 
banks. The FR 2835a panel comprises a sample of commercial banks with 
$1 billion or more in credit card receivables and a representative 
group of smaller issuers.
    Total estimated number of respondents: 200.
    Total estimated annual burden hours: 274.\1\
