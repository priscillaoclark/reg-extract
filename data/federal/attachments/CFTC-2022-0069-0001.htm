options positions held or introduced by futures commission merchants, 
members of contract markets, introducing brokers, and foreign brokers

and is promulgated pursuant to the Commission's rulemaking authority 
contained in section 8a of the Commodity Exchange Act, 7 U.S.C. 12a

published in the Federal Register notice of the proposed extension of 
this information collection and provided 60 days for public comment on 
the proposed extension, 87 FR 41293 (``60-Day Notice''). The Commission 
did not receive any relevant comments on the 60-Day Notice.
    Burden Statement: The Commission is updating its estimate of the 
burden for this collection for Market Surveys (OMB Control No. 3038-
0017). The Commission estimates the burden of this collection of 
information as follows:
    Estimated Number of Respondents: 100.
    Estimated Average Burden Hours per Respondent: 1.75 hours.
    Estimated Total Annual Burden Hours: 175 hours.
    Frequency of Collection: Annually.
    There are no capital costs or operating and maintenance costs 
associated with this collection.
