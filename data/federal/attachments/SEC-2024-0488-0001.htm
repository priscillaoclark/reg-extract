SECURITIES AND EXCHANGE COMMISSION

[Release No. 34-99881; File No. SR-NYSEARCA-2024-30]


Self-Regulatory Organizations; NYSE Arca, Inc.; Notice of Filing 
and Immediate Effectiveness of Proposed Rule Change To Amend Rule 7.4-E

April 1, 2024.
    Pursuant to Section 19(b)(1) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 
(the ``Act''),\1\ and Rule 19b-4 thereunder,\2\ notice is hereby given 
that on March 25, 2024, NYSE Arca, Inc. (``NYSE Arca'' or the 
``Exchange'') filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission (the 
``Commission'') the proposed rule change as described in Items I and II 
below, which Items have been prepared by the self-regulatory 
organization. The Commission is publishing this notice to solicit 
comments on the proposed rule change from interested persons.

    \2\ 17 CFR 240.19b-4.
---------------------------------------------------------------------------

I. Self-Regulatory Organization's Statement of the Terms of Substance 
of the Proposed Rule Change

    The Exchange proposes to amend Rule 7.4-E (Ex-Dividend or Ex-Right 
Dates) to conform to amendments to Rule 15c6-1(a) of the Act to shorten 
the standard settlement cycle for most broker-dealer transactions from 
two business days after the trade date (``T+2'') to one business day 
after the trade date (``T+1''). The proposed rule change is available 
on the Exchange's website at <a href="http://www.nyse.com">www.nyse.com</a>, at the principal office of 
the Exchange, and at the Commission's Public Reference Room.

II. Self-Regulatory Organization's Statement of the Purpose of, and 
Statutory Basis for, the Proposed Rule Change

    In its filing with the Commission, the self-regulatory organization 
included statements concerning the purpose of, and basis for, the 
proposed rule change and discussed any comments it received on the 
proposed rule change. The text of those statements may be examined at 
the places specified in Item IV below. The Exchange has prepared 
summaries, set forth in sections A, B, and C below, of the most 
significant parts of such statements.

A. Self-Regulatory Organization's Statement of the Purpose of, and the 
Statutory Basis for, the Proposed Rule Change

1. Purpose
    On March 6, 2023, the Commission adopted amendments to Rule 15c6-
1(a) of the Act to shorten the standard settlement cycle for most 
broker-dealer transactions from T+2 to T+1.\3\ Accordingly, the 
Exchange proposes to amend Rule 7.4-E to conform with the amendments to 
Rule 15c6-1(a) and reflect a standard settlement cycle of T+1.
---------------------------------------------------------------------------

    \3\ See Securities Exchange Act Release No. 96930, 88 FR 13872 
(March 6, 2023) (``T+1 Adopting Release'').
---------------------------------------------------------------------------

    Rule 7.4-E currently provides that transactions in stocks traded 
``regular way'' are generally ``ex-dividend'' or ``ex-rights'' on the 
business day preceding the record date fixed by the company or the date 
of the closing of transfer books. The rule further provides that, if 
the record date or closing of transfer books occur on a day other than 
a business day, transactions would be ``ex-dividend'' or ``ex-rights'' 
on the second preceding business day.
    The Exchange proposes to amend Rule 7.4-E to provide, in conformity

[[Page 24076]]

with the transition to a T+1 settlement cycle, that transactions in 
stocks traded ``regular way'' generally will be ``ex-dividend'' or 
``ex-rights'' on the record date fixed by the company or the date of 
the closing of transfer books, or if the record date or closing of 
transfer books occur on a day other than a business day, on the 
preceding business day.
Implementation
    The Exchange proposes that the operative date of this proposed rule 
change will be Tuesday, May 28, 2024, which is the compliance date 
specified in the T+1 Adopting Release, or such later date as may be 
announced by the Commission for compliance with the amendments to Rule 
15c6-1(a) set forth in the T+1 Adopting Release.\4\ With the 
implementation of the T+1 settlement cycle and as described in the 
proposed changes outlined above, the ex-dividend date for ``normal'' 
distributions will be the same business day as the record date. 
Accordingly, the Exchange proposes that Wednesday, May 29, 2024 would 
be the first date to which the proposed rules described herein would 
apply (i.e., the first record date to which the new ex-dividend date 
rationale will be applied). During the implementation of the T+1 
settlement cycle, the Exchange proposes that the ex-dividend dates will 
be as follows:
---------------------------------------------------------------------------

    \4\ See id.

------------------------------------------------------------------------
                Record date                       Ex-dividend date
------------------------------------------------------------------------
May 24, 2024..............................  May 23, 2024.
May 28, 2024..............................  May 24, 2024.
May 29, 2024..............................  May 29, 2024.
------------------------------------------------------------------------

    A record date of Friday, May 24, 2024 would be a date prior to the 
effective date of the amendments to Rule 15c6-1(a) of the Act to 
shorten the standard settlement cycle for most broker-dealer 
transactions from T+2 to T+1.\5\ The rules described above would apply 
to this record date in their current form and, thus, the ``ex-dividend 
date'' would be the first business day preceding the record date or 
Thursday, May 23, 2024. Monday, May 27, 2024 is Memorial Day, which is 
an Exchange holiday; accordingly, there would be no record date on a 
holiday. A record date of Tuesday, May 28, 2024 would also fall under 
the Exchange's current rules, and the first business day preceding such 
record date would be Friday, May 24, 2024. On Wednesday, May 29, 2024, 
the proposed rules described above would apply, such that, for the 
record date of May 29, 2024, the ``ex-dividend date'' would be the same 
business day.
---------------------------------------------------------------------------

    \5\ See note 3, supra.
---------------------------------------------------------------------------

    The Exchange will issue a Trader Notice regarding the 
implementation of the proposed rule change and T+1 settlement cycle, 
which date would correspond with the industry-led transition to a T+1 
standard settlement, and the compliance date of the Commission's 
amendment of Rule 15c6-1(a) of the Act to require standard settlement 
no later than T+1.
2. Statutory Basis
    The Exchange believes that the proposed rule change is consistent 
with Section 6(b) of the Act,\6\ in general, and furthers the 
objectives of Section 6(b)(5) of the Act,\7\ in particular, because it 
is designed to prevent fraudulent and manipulative acts and practices, 
promote just and equitable principles of trade, to foster cooperation 
and coordination with persons engaged in regulating, clearing, 
settling, processing information with respect to, and remove 
impediments to and perfect the mechanism of a free and open market and 
a national market system, and, in general, to protect investors and the 
public interest.
---------------------------------------------------------------------------

    \6\ 15 U.S.C. 78f(b).
    \7\ 15 U.S.C. 78f(b)(5).
---------------------------------------------------------------------------

    In particular, the proposed rule change would amend the Exchange's 
rules to reflect a standard settlement cycle of T+1, in support of the 
industry-led initiative to shorten the settlement cycle to one business 
day. Moreover, the proposed rule change is consistent with the 
Commission's amendments to Rule 15c6-1(a) of the Act to require 
standard settlement no later than T+1. The Exchange believes that the 
proposed rule change would provide regulatory certainty to facilitate 
the industry-led move to a T+1 settlement cycle. The Exchange further 
believes that, by shortening the time period for settlement of most 
securities transactions, the proposed rule change would protect 
investors and the public interest by reducing the number of unsettled 
trades in the clearance and settlement system at any given time, 
thereby reducing the risk inherent in settling securities transactions 
to clearing corporations, their members, and public investors.

B. Self-Regulatory Organization's Statement on Burden on Competition

    The Exchange does not believe that the proposed rule change will 
impose any burden on competition that is not necessary or appropriate 
in furtherance of the purposes of the Act. The proposed change is not 
designed to address any competitive issue, but rather to support the 
industry's transition to a T+1 regular-way settlement cycle in 
conformity with the Commission's amendment of Rule 15c6-1(a). The 
proposed change amends the Exchange's rules pertaining to securities 
settlement, which rules would apply uniformly to all contracts for the 
purchase or sale of a security (other than exempted securities) that 
provide for payment of funds and delivery of securities that occur on 
the Exchange or other self-regulatory organizations, and is intended to 
facilitate the industry-wide transition to a T+1 settlement cycle. The 
Exchange also believes that the proposed rule change will serve to 
promote clarity and consistency in its rules, thereby reducing burdens 
on the marketplace and facilitating investor protection. Accordingly, 
the Exchange believes that the proposed changes do not impose any 
burden on competition other than that necessary to implement the 
amendments to Rule 15c6-1(a) of the Act as set forth in the T+1 
Adopting Release.\8\

---------------------------------------------------------------------------

C. Self-Regulatory Organization's Statement on Comments on the Proposed 
Rule Change Received From Members, Participants, or Others

    No written comments were solicited or received with respect to the 
proposed rule change.

III. Date of Effectiveness of the Proposed Rule Change and Timing for 
Commission Action

    Because the foregoing proposed rule change does not:
    (i) significantly affect the protection of investors or the public 
interest;
    (ii) impose any significant burden on competition; and
    (iii) become operative for 30 days from the date on which it was 
filed, or such shorter time as the Commission may designate, it has 
become effective pursuant to Section 19(b)(3)(A) of the Act and Rule 
19b-4(f)(6) thereunder.
    At any time within 60 days of the filing of the proposed rule 
change, the Commission summarily may temporarily suspend such rule 
change if it appears to the Commission that such action is necessary or 
appropriate in the public interest, for the protection of investors, or 
otherwise in furtherance of the purposes of the Act.

IV. Solicitation of Comments

    Interested persons are invited to submit written data, views and 
arguments concerning the foregoing, including whether the proposed rule 
change is consistent with the Act.
