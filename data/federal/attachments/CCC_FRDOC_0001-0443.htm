SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION: 
    Title: Assignment and Joint Payment Elections.
    Forms: CCC-36, ``Assignment of Payment;'' CCC-37, ``Joint Payment 
Authorization;'' and-FPAC-FMD-12 Electronic Funds Transfer (EFT) 
Hardship Waiver Request.
    OMB Control Number: 0560-0183.
    Expiration Date of Approval: August 31, 2024.
    Type of Request: Revision and extension of a currently approved 
information collection request.
    Abstract: FSA and CCC are requesting an extension with a revision 
of the currently approved information. Section 8(g) of the Soil 
Conservation and Domestic Allotment Act (16 U.S.C. 590h(g)) authorizes 
producers to assign FSA conservation program payments in accordance 
with regulations issued by the Secretary. The Assignment of Payments 
regulation as specified in 7 CFR part 1404 requires that any such 
assignment be signed by both the assignor and the assignee. The 
Agricultural Act of 1949, as amended, extends that authority to CCC 
programs, including rice, feed grains, cotton, and wheat. The Natural 
Conservation Service (NRCS) is also using the forms, but most NRCS 
programs are exempt from the PRA.
    Producers (Assignors) use form CCC-36-Assignment of Payment to 
assign payments under various CCC, FSA, or NRCS programs. Customers may 
submit a completed CCC-36 to any FSA and NRCS County Office to be 
entered into the Financial Services application or the NRCS ProTracts 
web application. County Office data entry requires a second user for 
verification. The second user may be located in the same County Office 
or another Office. When there is no second user available, an employee 
from another County Office may perform this action by submitting a 
faxed copy of the form.
    Producers use form CCC-37-Joint Payment Authorization to make 
program payments from the CCC or FSA jointly payable to multiple 
entities. They must submit the form in hard copy or electronically to 
the FSA County office that retains copies for the producer and joint 
payee. No fax is allowed for this form. There are no regulations 
governing joint payments (CCC-37-Joint Payment Authorization), but this 
service is offered as a result of public requests for the type of 
payment option.
    Customers may use the form FPAC FMD-12, Electronic Funds Transfer 
(EFT) Hardship Waiver Request for FSA. Payments of Federal Benefits by 
Check to invoke a hardship waiver payment. In accordance with Treasury 
Regulation 31 CFR 208, Payments by electronic funds transfer (EFT) are 
not required for anyone over the age of 90 born prior to May 1, 1921. 
The hardship waiver request can currently be submitted either in person 
or by phone call to the local county FSA office by entering the waiver 
request in the Financial Service application for the following reasons: 
Geographic Barrier or Mental Impairment.
    The differences in the forms are that FSA use a tax identification 
number instead of a social security number. Most NRCS programs and some 
FSA programs are exempt from the Paperwork Reduction Act.
    In the information collection request, the number of responses and 
respondents decreased by 262,107 and the burden hours also decreased by 
43,725 which were all due to fewer producers or farmers participating 
in several programs such as the Coronavirus Food Assistance Program 
(CFAP), Wildfires and Hurricanes Indemnity Program, and other FSA 
programs. The forms of CCC-251 and CCC-252 were removed from the 
collection due to less than 10 respondents using each form.

[[Page 47127]]

    For the following estimated total annual burden on respondents, the 
formula used to calculate the total burden hours is the estimated 
average time per response multiplied by the estimated total annual 
responses.
    Estimate of Respondent Burden: Public reporting burden for 
collecting information under this notice is estimated to average 0.1667 
hour per response, including the time for reviewing instructions, 
searching existing data sources, gathering and maintaining the data 
needed, and completing and reviewing the collections of information.
    Type of Respondents: Producers participating in FSA, CCC, and NRCS 
programs.
    Estimated Number of Respondents: 202,612.
    Estimated Average Number of Responses per Respondent: 2.163.
    Estimated Total Annual Responses: 438,584.
    Estimated Average Time per Response: 0.1664.
    Estimated Total Annual Burden on Respondents: 72,962 hours.
    We are requesting comments on all aspects of this information 
collection to help FSA:
    (1) Evaluate whether the proposed collection of information is 
necessary for the proper performance of the functions of the agency, 
including whether the information will have practical utility;
    (2) Evaluate the accuracy of the agency's estimate of burden of the 
collection of information including the validity of the methodology and 
assumptions used;
    (3) Evaluate the quality, ability and clarity of the information 
technology; and
    (4) Minimize the burden of the information collection on those who 
respond through the use of appropriate automated, electronic, 
mechanical, or other technological collection techniques or other forms 
of information technology.
    All comments received in response to this notice, including names 
and addresses when provided, will be made a matter of public record. 
Comments will be summarized and included in the submission for Office 
of Management and Budget approval.
