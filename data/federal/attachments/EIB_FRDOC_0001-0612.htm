SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION: This collection of information is necessary,

support of the shipment(s) under its insurance program. Export-Import 
Bank customers will be able to submit this form on paper or

foreign export credit agency; the information collected includes vital 
facts such as the amount of U.S.-made content in the export, the amount 
of financing requested from EXIM, and the proposed financing amount 
from the foreign export credit agency. These details are necessary for 
approving this unique transaction structure and coordinating our 
support with that of the foreign export credit agency to ultimately 
complete the transaction and support U.S. exports--and U.S. jobs.
