SECURITIES AND EXCHANGE COMMISSION

[SEC File No. 270-349, OMB Control No. 3235-0395]


Submission for OMB Review; Comment Request; Extension: Rule 15g-6

Upon Written Request, Copies Available From: Securities and Exchange 
Commission, Office of FOIA Services, 100 F Street NE, Washington, DC 
20549-2736

    Notice is hereby given that pursuant to the Paperwork Reduction Act 
of 1995 (``PRA'') (44 U.S.C. 3501 et seq.), the Securities and Exchange 
Commission (``Commission'') has submitted to the Office of Management 
and Budget (``OMB'') a request for approval of extension of the 
previously approved collection of information provided for in Rule 15g-
6--Account Statements for Penny Stock Customers--(17 CFR 240.15g-6) 
under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 (15 U.S.C. 78a et seq.).
    Rule 15g-6 requires brokers and dealers that sell penny stocks to 
provide their customers monthly account statements containing 
information with regard to the penny stocks held in customer accounts. 
The purpose of the rule is to increase the level of disclosure to 
investors concerning penny stocks generally and specific penny stock 
transactions.
    The Commission estimates that approximately 170 broker-dealers will 
spend an average of approximately 78 hours annually to comply with this 
rule. Thus, the total compliance burden is approximately 13,260 burden-
hours per year.
    An agency may not conduct or sponsor, and a person is not required 
to respond to, a collection of information under the PRA unless it 
displays a currently valid OMB control number.
    The public may view background documentation for this information 
collection at the following website: <a href="http://www.reginfo.gov">www.reginfo.gov</a>. Find this 
particular information collection by selecting ``Currently under 30-day 
Review--Open for Public Comments'' or by using the search function.

collection should be sent by September 26, 2024 to (i) <a href="http://www.reginfo.gov/public/do/PRAMain">www.reginfo.gov/public/do/PRAMain</a> and (ii) Austin Gerig, Director/Chief Data Officer,

    Dated: August 22, 2024.
Vanessa A. Countryman,
Secretary.
