SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION: 
    Title: Regulations Governing Bankruptcies of Commodity Brokers (OMB 
Control No. 3038-0021). This is a request for an extension of a 
currently approved information collection.\1\
---------------------------------------------------------------------------

    \1\ There are two information collections associated with OMB 
Control No. 3038-0021. The first includes the reporting, 
recordkeeping, and third party disclosure requirements applicable to 
a single respondent in a commodity broker liquidation (e.g., a 
single commodity broker or a single trustee) within the relevant 
time period provided for in Commission regulations 190.02(b)(1), 
190.02(b)(2), 190.02(c)(1), 190.02(c)(2), 190.02(c)(4), 190.05(b), 
190.05(d), 190.07(b)(5), 190.12(a)(2), 190.12(b)(1), 190.12(b)(2), 
190.12(c)(1), 190.12(c)(2), and 190.14(a), and 190.14(d). The second 
information collection includes third party disclosure requirements 
that are applicable on a regular basis to multiple respondents 
(i.e., multiple FCMs) provided for in Commission regulations 1.41, 
1.43 and 1.55(p).

---------------------------------------------------------------------------

    Abstract: This collection of information involves the reporting, 
recordkeeping, and third-party disclosure requirements set forth in the 
CFTC's bankruptcy regulations for commodity broker liquidations, 17 CFR 
part 190. These regulations apply to commodity broker liquidations 
under Chapter 7, Subchapter IV of the Bankruptcy Code.\2\
---------------------------------------------------------------------------

    \2\ 11 U.S.C. 761 et seq.
---------------------------------------------------------------------------

    The reporting requirements include, for example, notices to the 
Commission regarding the filing of petitions for bankruptcy and notices 
to the Commission regarding the intention to transfer open commodity 
contracts in a commodity broker liquidation. The recordkeeping 
requirements include, for example, the statements of customer accounts 
that a trustee appointed for the purposes of a commodity broker 
liquidation (Trustee) must generate and adjust as set forth in the 
regulations. The third party disclosure requirements include, for 
example, the disclosure statement that a commodity broker must provide 
to its customers containing information regarding the manner in which 
customer property is treated under part 190 of the Commission's 
regulations in the event of a bankruptcy and, in the event of a 
commodity broker liquidation, certain notices that a Trustee must 
provide to customers and to the persons to whom commodity contracts and 
specifically identifiable customer property have been or will be 
transferred. The information collection requirements are necessary, and 
will be used, to facilitate the effective, efficient, and fair conduct 
of liquidation proceedings for commodity brokers and to protect the 
interests of customers in these proceedings both directly and by 
facilitating the participation of the CFTC in such proceedings.
    An agency may not conduct or sponsor, and a person is not required 
to respond to, a collection of information unless it displays a 
currently valid OMB number. On June 17, 2024, the Commission published 
in the Federal Register notice of the proposed extension of this 
information collection and provided 60 days for public comment on the 
proposed extension, 89 FR 51315, June 17, 2024 (``60-Day Notice''). The 
Commission did not receive any relevant comments. Accordingly, the 
Commission is retaining the burden estimates set forth in the 60-Day 
Notice.
    Burden Statement: The Commission notes that commodity broker 
liquidations occur at unpredictable and irregular intervals when 
particular commodity brokers become insolvent. While a commodity broker 
liquidation has not occurred in the past three years, the Commission 
took the conservative approach of maintaining the assumptions contained 
in the previous renewal of this information collection that, on 
average, a Futures Commission Merchant (``FCM'') commodity broker 
liquidation would occur every three years and that a Derivatives 
Clearing Organization (``DCO'') commodity broker liquidation would 
occur every fifty years. The Commission generally has retained the 
burden hour estimates set forth in the previous information collection 
as there have been no interim experiences nor are there currently 
apparent circumstances that would warrant altering those estimates. The 
Commission further notes, however, that the information collection 
burden will vary in particular commodity broker liquidations depending 
on the size of the commodity broker, the extent to which accounts are 
able to be quickly transferred, and other factors specific to the 
circumstances of the liquidation.
    The respondent burden for this information collection is estimated 
to be as follows: \3\
---------------------------------------------------------------------------

    \3\ Because an FCM commodity broker liquidation is estimated to 
occur only once every three years, this information collection 
expresses such burdens in terms of those that would be imposed on 
one respondent during the three-year period.
