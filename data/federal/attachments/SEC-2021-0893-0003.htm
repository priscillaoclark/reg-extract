SECURITIES AND EXCHANGE COMMISSION

[SEC File No. 270-451, OMB Control No. 3235-0509]


Proposed Collection; Comment Request; Extension: Rule 301 of 
Regulation ATS

Upon Written Request, Copies Available From: Securities and Exchange 
Commission, Office of FOIA Services, 100 F Street NE, Washington, DC 
20549-2736

    Notice is hereby given that pursuant to the Paperwork Reduction Act 
of 1995 (``PRA'') (44 U.S.C. 3501 et seq.), the Securities and Exchange 
Commission

[[Page 73137]]

(``Commission'') is soliciting comments on the existing collection of 
information provided for in Rule 301 of Regulation ATS (17 CFR 242.301) 
under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 (15 U.S.C. 78a et seq.). The 
Commission plans to submit this existing collection of information to 
the Office of Management and Budget (``OMB'') for extension and 
approval.
    Regulation ATS provides a regulatory structure for alternative 
trading systems. Rule 301 of Regulation ATS contains certain record 
keeping and reporting requirements, as well as additional obligations 
that apply only to alternative trading systems with significant volume. 
The Rule requires all alternative trading systems that wish to comply 
with Regulation ATS to file an initial operation report on Form ATS. 
Alternative trading systems are also required to supply updates on Form 
ATS to the Commission describing material changes to the system, file 
quarterly transaction reports on Form ATS-R, and file cessation of 
operations reports on Form ATS. An alternative trading system with 
significant volume is required to comply with requirements for fair 
access and systems capacity, integrity, and security.
    The Commission staff estimates that entities subject to the 
requirements of Rule 301 will spend a total of approximately 2,983 
hours a year to comply with the Rule.
    Regulation ATS requires ATSs to preserve any records, for at least 
three years, made in the process of complying with the system's 
capacity, integrity and security requirements.
    Written comments are invited on: (a) whether the proposed 
collection of information is necessary for the proper performance of 
the functions of the Commission, including whether the information 
shall have practical utility; (b) the accuracy of the Commission's 
estimates of the burden of the proposed collection of information; (c) 
ways to enhance the quality, utility, and clarity of the information 
collected; and (d) ways to minimize the burden of the collection of 
information on respondents, including through the use of automated 
collection techniques or other forms of information technology. 
Consideration will be given to comments and suggestions submitted by 
November 8, 2024.
    An agency may not conduct or sponsor, and a person is not required 
to respond to, a collection of information under the PRA unless it 
displays a currently valid OMB control number.
    Please direct your written comments to: Austin Gerig, Director/
Chief Data Officer, Securities and Exchange Commission, c/o Oluwaseun 
Ajayi, 100 F Street NE, Washington, DC 20549, or send an email to:

Secretary.
