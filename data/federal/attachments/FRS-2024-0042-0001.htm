production of confidential supervisory information or other nonpublic 
information of the Board in the form of documents or testimony. Subpart 
C also contains one recordkeeping requirement related to a provision 
that allows supervised financial institutions to disclose confidential 
supervisory information to service providers if the disclosure is 
deemed necessary to the service provider's provision of services, and 
two disclosure requirements that apply when individuals are served with 
a subpoena, order, or other judicial or administrative process 
requiring the production of confidential supervisory information or 
other nonpublic information of the Board in the form of documents or 
testimony.
    Frequency: Event-generated.
    Respondents: Supervised financial institutions; State, local, and 
foreign agencies; entities exercising governmental authority; and any 
person, entity, agency, or authority.
    Total estimated number of respondents: 105.
    Total estimated annual burden hours: 83.\1\
