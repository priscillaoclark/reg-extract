(``Commission''), pursuant to section 19(b)(1) of the Securities

available at: <a href="https://www.sec.gov/comments/sr-cboebzx-2023-063/srcboebzx2023063.htm">https://www.sec.gov/comments/sr-cboebzx-2023-063/srcboebzx2023063.htm</a>.
---------------------------------------------------------------------------

    Section 19(b)(2) of the Act \4\ provides that within 45 days of the 
publication of notice of the filing of a proposed rule change, or 
within such longer period up to 90 days (i) as the Commission may 
designate if it finds such longer period to be appropriate and 
publishes its reasons for so finding or (ii) as to which the self-
regulatory organization consents, the Commission shall either approve 
the proposed rule change, disapprove the proposed rule change, or 
institute proceedings to determine whether the proposed rule change 
should be disapproved. The 45th day after publication of the notice for 
this proposed rule change is November 16, 2023. The Commission is

period within which to take action on the proposed rule change so that 
it has sufficient time to consider the proposed rule change and the 
comments received. Accordingly, pursuant to section 19(b)(2) of the 
Act,\5\ the Commission designates December 31, 2023, as the date by 
which the Commission shall either approve or disapprove, or institute 
proceedings to determine whether to disapprove, the proposed rule 
change (File No. SR-CboeBZX-2023-063).
