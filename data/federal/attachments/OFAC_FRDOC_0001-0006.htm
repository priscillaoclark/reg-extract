Background

    On December 17, 2004, the Office of Foreign Assets Control 
(``OFAC'') of the Department of the Treasury amended the Cuban Assets 
Control Regulations, 31 CFR Part 515 (the ``CACR''), the Sudanese 
Sanctions Regulations, 31 CFR Part 538 (the ``SSR''), and the Iranian 
Transactions Regulations, 31 CFR Part 560 (the ``ITR''), to authorize 
certain activities related to publishing. See 69 FR 75468 (December 17, 
2004). OFAC added Sec. Sec.  515.577, 538.529, and 560.538 to the CACR, 
SSR, and ITR, respectively, to authorize by general license 
transactions not already exempt from regulation that support the 
publishing and marketing of manuscripts, books, journals, and 
newspapers in paper and electronic format (``written publications''). 
On August 16, 2005, OFAC amended and reissued the Burmese Sanctions 
Regulations, 31 CFR Part 537 (the ``BSR'') including, at Sec.  537.526, 
a general license for the same publishing-related transactions.
    OFAC is amending these general licenses in various places to 
authorize the augmentation of written publications in electronic format 
through the addition of embedded software necessary for reading, 
browsing, navigating, or searching the written publications as well as 
the exportation of such embedded software provided certain conditions 
are met. These amendments also clarify that the term ``written 
publications'' used in the general licenses includes manuscripts, 
books, journals, and newspapers even if they are published solely in 
electronic format. A note is added to each general license clarifying 
that the importation and exportation of information or informational 
materials are exempt from the prohibitions and regulations contained in 
the CACR, SSR, and ITR and, in the case of the BSR, clarifying that the 
importation of informational materials is authorized and the 
exportation of informational materials is exempt from the prohibitions 
and regulations of the BSR. These amendments also make various other 
technical corrections, clarifications, and conforming changes.

Public Participation; Procedural Requirements

    Because the CACR, BSR, SSR, and ITR involve a foreign affairs 
function, the provisions of Executive Order 12866

[[Page 50048]]

and the Administrative Procedure Act (5 U.S.C. 553) requiring notice of 
proposed rulemaking, opportunity for public participation, and delay in 
effective date are inapplicable. Because no notice of proposed 
rulemaking is required for this rule, the Regulatory Flexibility Act (5 
U.S.C. 601-612) does not apply.

Paperwork Reduction Act

    The collections of information related to 31 CFR parts 515, 537, 
538, and 560 are contained in 31 CFR part 501. Pursuant to the 
Paperwork Reduction Act of 1995 (44 U.S.C. 3507), those collections of 
information have been approved by the Office of Management and Budget 
under control number 1505-0164. An agency may not conduct or sponsor, 
and a person is not required to respond to, a collection of information 
unless the collection of information displays a valid control number.

    This section does not apply if the parties to the transactions 
described in this paragraph include the Government of Cuba. For the 
purposes of this section, the term ``Government of Cuba'' includes the

For the purposes of this section, the term ``Government of Cuba'' does

    (b) This section does not authorize transactions involving the 
provision of goods or services not necessary and ordinarily incident to

the use of information and informational materials;
    (2) To create or undertake for any person a marketing campaign with 
respect to any service or product other than a written publication, or 
to create or undertake a marketing campaign of any kind for the benefit

regardless of format or medium of transmission, are exempt from the 
prohibitions and regulations of this part. See Sec.  515.206(a).

    (c) This section does not authorize persons subject to the

at 10 CFR part 810.
    (3) The exportation of information or technology subject to the

as set forth in part 744 of the EAR. In addition, U.S. persons are 
precluded from exporting any item subject to the EAR to certain 
restricted end-users, as set forth in part 744 of the EAR, as well as 
certain persons whose export privileges have been denied pursuant to 
parts 764 or 766 of the EAR, without authorization from the Department 
of Commerce; or

case-by-case basis authorizing the travel-related transactions set 
forth in Sec.  515.560(c) and such additional transactions that are

2. Section 560.538 is revised to read as follows:


Sec.  560.538  Authorized transactions necessary and ordinarily 
incident to publishing.

    (a) To the extent that such activities are not exempt from this 
part, and subject to the restrictions set forth in paragraphs (b) 
through (d) of this section, U.S. persons are authorized to engage in 
all transactions necessary and ordinarily incident to the publishing 
and marketing of manuscripts, books, journals, and newspapers in paper 
or electronic format (collectively, ``written publications''). This 
section does not apply if the parties to the transactions described in 
this paragraph include the Government of Iran. For the purposes of this 
section, the term ``Government of Iran'' includes the state and the 
Government of Iran, as well as any political subdivision, agency, or 
instrumentality thereof, which includes the Central Bank of Islamic 
Republic of Iran, and any person acting or purporting to act directly 
or indirectly on behalf of any of the foregoing with respect to the 
transactions described in this paragraph. For the purposes of this 
section, the term ``Government of Iran'' does not include any academic 
and research institutions and their personnel. Pursuant to this 
section, the following activities are authorized, provided that U.S. 
persons ensure that they are not engaging, without separate 
authorization, in the activities identified in paragraphs (b) through 
(d) of this section:
    (1) Commissioning and making advance payments for identifiable 
written publications not yet in existence, to the extent consistent 
with industry practice;
    (2) Collaborating on the creation and enhancement of written 
publications;
    (3)(i) Augmenting written publications through the addition of 
items such as photographs, artwork, translation, explanatory text, and, 
for a written publication in electronic format, the addition of 
embedded software necessary for reading, browsing, navigating, or 
searching the written publication;
    (ii) Exporting embedded software necessary for reading, browsing, 
navigating, or searching a written publication in electronic format, 
provided that the software is classified as ``EAR 99'' under the Export 
Administration Regulations, 15 CFR parts 730 through 774 (the ``EAR''), 
or is not subject to the EAR;
    (4) Substantive editing of written publications;
    (5) Payment of royalties for written publications;
    (6) Creating or undertaking a marketing campaign to promote a 
written publication; and
    (7) Other transactions necessary and ordinarily incident to the 
publishing and marketing of written publications as described in this 
paragraph (a).
    (b) This section does not authorize transactions involving the 
provision of goods or services not necessary and ordinarily incident to 
the publishing and marketing of written publications as described in 
paragraph (a) of this section. For example, this section does not 
authorize U.S. persons:
    (1) To provide or receive individualized or customized services 
(including, but not limited to, accounting, legal, design, or 
consulting services), other than those necessary and ordinarily 
incident to the publishing and marketing of written publications, even 
though such individualized or customized services are delivered through 
the use of information and informational materials;
    (2) To create or undertake for any person a marketing campaign with 
respect to any service or product other than a written publication, or 
to create or undertake a marketing campaign of any kind for the benefit 
of the Government of Iran;
    (3) To engage in the exportation or importation of goods to or from 
Iran other than the exportation of embedded software described in 
paragraph (a)(3)(ii); or
    (4) To operate a publishing house, sales outlet, or other office in 
Iran.

    Note to paragraph (b): The importation from Iran and the 
exportation to Iran of information or informational materials, as 
defined in Sec.  560.315, whether commercial or otherwise, 
regardless of format or medium of transmission, are exempt from the 
prohibitions and regulations of this part. See Sec.  560.210(c).

    (c) This section does not authorize U.S. persons to engage the 
services of publishing houses or translators in Iran unless such 
activity is primarily for the dissemination of written publications in 
Iran.
    (d) This section does not authorize:
    (1) The exportation from or importation into the United States of 
services for the development, production, or design of software;
    (2) Transactions for the development, production, design, or 
marketing of technology specifically controlled by the International 
Traffic in Arms Regulations, 22 CFR parts 120 through 130 (the 
``ITAR''), the EAR, or the Department of Energy Regulations set forth 
at 10 CFR part 810.
    (3) The exportation of information or technology subject to the 
authorization requirements of 10 CFR part 810, or Restricted Data as 
defined in section 11 y. of the Atomic Energy Act of 1954, as amended, 
or of other information, data, or technology the release of which is

[[Page 50052]]

controlled under the Atomic Energy Act and regulations therein;
    (4) The exportation of any item (including information) subject to 
the EAR where a U.S. person knows or has reason to know that the item 
will be used, directly or indirectly, with respect to certain nuclear, 
missile, chemical, or biological weapons or nuclear-maritime end-uses 
as set forth in part 744 of the EAR. In addition, U.S. persons are 
precluded from exporting any item subject to the EAR to certain 
restricted end-users, as set forth in part 744 of the EAR, as well as 
certain persons whose export privileges have been denied pursuant to 
parts 764 or 766 of the EAR, without authorization from the Department 
of Commerce; or
    (5) The exportation of information subject to licensing 
requirements under the ITAR or exchanges of information that are 
subject to regulation by other government agencies.
