SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION: 
    Title: Ownership and Control Reports, Forms 102/102S, 40/40S, and 
71 (Trader and Account Identification Reports) (OMB Control No. 3038-
0103). This is a request for extension of a currently approved 
information collection.
    Abstract: The final rules \2\ created new information collection 
requirements via Sec. Sec.  17.01, 18.04, 18.05, and 20.5. 
Specifically, Sec.  17.01 provides for the filing of Form 102A, Form 
102B and Form 71, as follows:
---------------------------------------------------------------------------

    \2\ See Final Rule, Ownership and Control Reports, Forms 102/
102S, 40/40S, and 71, 78 FR 69178 (Nov. 18, 2013). Terms used herein 
and not otherwise defined herein shall have the meaning assigned to 
such terms in the final rules or in the Commission's regulations.
---------------------------------------------------------------------------

    <bullet> Pursuant to Sec.  17.01(a), futures commission merchants 
(``FCMs''), clearing members, and foreign brokers shall identify new 
special accounts to the Commission on Form 102A;
    <bullet> Pursuant to Sec.  17.01(b), clearing members shall 
identify volume threshold accounts to the Commission on Form 102B; and
    <bullet> Pursuant to Sec.  17.01(c), omnibus volume threshold 
account originators and omnibus reportable sub-account originators 
shall identify reportable subaccounts to the Commission on Form 71 when 
requested via a special call by the Commission or its designee.
    Additional reporting requirements arise from Sec.  18.04, which 
results in the collection of information via Form 40 from and regarding 
traders who own, hold, or control reportable positions; volume 
threshold account controllers; persons who own volume threshold 
accounts; reportable sub-account controllers; and persons who own 
reportable sub-accounts.
    Reporting requirements also arise from Sec.  20.5(a), which 
requires all reporting entities to submit Form 102S for swap 
counterparty or customer consolidated accounts with reportable 
positions. In addition, Sec.  20.5(b) requires every person subject to 
books or records under current Sec.  20.6 to complete a 40S filing 
after a special call upon such person by the Commission.
    In addition to the reporting requirements summarized above, Sec.  
18.05 imposes recordkeeping requirements upon: (1) Traders who own, 
hold, or control a reportable futures or options on futures position; 
(2) volume threshold account controllers; (3) persons who own volume 
threshold accounts; (4) reportable sub-account controllers; and (5) 
persons who own reportable subaccounts.
    With respect to the collection of information, the CFTC invites 
comments on:
    <bullet> Whether the proposed collection of information is 
necessary for the proper performance of the functions of the 
Commission, including whether the information will have a practical 
use;
    <bullet> The accuracy of the Commission's estimate of the burden of 
the proposed collection of information, including the validity of the 
methodology and assumptions used;
    <bullet> Ways to enhance the quality, usefulness, and clarity of 
the information to be collected; and
    <bullet> Ways to minimize the burden of collection of information 
on those who are to respond, including through the use of appropriate 
automated electronic, mechanical, or other technological collection 
techniques or other forms of information technology, e.g., permitting 
electronic submission of responses.
    An agency may not conduct or sponsor, and a person is not required 
to respond to, a collection of information unless it displays a 
currently valid OMB control number. On August 30, 2023, the Commission 
published in the Federal Register notice of the proposed revision of 
this information collection

[[Page 77566]]

and provided 60 days for public comment on the proposed extension, 88 
FR 59877 (``60-Day Notice''). The Commission received no relevant 
comments that addressed its PRA burden estimates.
    Burden Statement: The Commission estimates the burden of this 
collection of information as follows:
    Estimated Number of Respondents: 1,779.
    Estimated Average Burden Hours per Respondent: 102.
    Estimated Total Annual Burden Hours: 188,980.
    Frequency of Collection: On occasion.

(Authority: 44 U.S.C. 3501 et seq.)

    Dated: November 6, 2023.
Robert Sidman,
Deputy Secretary of the Commission.
