which governs the listing and trading of Commodity-Based Trust Shares 
on the Exchange.
---------------------------------------------------------------------------

    \7\ See Notice, supra note 3.

    The investment objective of the Trust is to generally reflect the 
performance of the price of bitcoin before payment of the Trust's 
expenses.\8\ The Trust's assets will consist of bitcoin held by the 
Trust's bitcoin custodian on behalf of the Trust and cash holdings, if 
any.\9\ The Trust will value its Shares daily based on the value of 
bitcoin as reflected by the CME CF Bitcoin Reference Rate 
(``Index'').\10\ The administrator for the Trust will determine the net 
asset value (``NAV'') of the Trust on each day that the Exchange is 
open for regular trading, as promptly as practicable after 4:00 p.m. 
ET.\11\ In determining the Trust's NAV, the administrator for the Trust 
will value the bitcoin held by the Trust based on the price set by the 
Index as of 4:00 p.m. ET.\12\

sponsor of the Trust. See id. at 88669. Donald J. Puglisi is the

II. Proceedings To Determine Whether To Approve or Disapprove SR-
CboeBZX-2023-101 and Grounds for Disapproval Under Consideration

    The Commission is instituting proceedings pursuant to Section 
19(b)(2)(B) of the Act \13\ to determine whether the proposed rule 
change should be approved or disapproved. Institution of proceedings is 
appropriate at this time in view of the legal and policy issues raised 
by the proposed rule change, as discussed below. Institution of 
proceedings does not indicate that the Commission has reached any 
conclusions with respect to any of the issues involved. Rather, as 
described below, the Commission seeks and encourages interested persons 
to provide comments on the proposed rule change.
---------------------------------------------------------------------------

    \13\ 15 U.S.C. 78s(b)(2)(B).
---------------------------------------------------------------------------

    Pursuant to Section 19(b)(2)(B) of the Act,\14\ the Commission is 
providing notice of the grounds for disapproval under consideration. 
The Commission is instituting proceedings to allow for additional 
analysis of the proposed rule change's consistency with Section 6(b)(5) 
of the Act, which requires, among other things, that the rules of a 
national securities exchange be ``designed to prevent fraudulent and 
manipulative acts and practices'' and ``to protect investors and the 
public interest.'' \15\
---------------------------------------------------------------------------

    \14\ Id.
    \15\ 15 U.S.C. 78f(b)(5).
---------------------------------------------------------------------------

    The Commission asks that commenters address the sufficiency of the 
Exchange's statements in support of the proposal, which are set forth 
in the Notice, in addition to any other comments they may wish to 
submit about the proposed rule change. In particular, the Commission 
seeks commenters' views on whether the Exchange has sufficiently 
described the Trust, the terms of the Trust, and representations that 
would apply to the Trust, including the applicable listing standards.

III. Procedure: Request for Written Comments

    The Commission requests that interested persons provide written 
submissions of their views, data, and arguments with respect to the 
issues identified above, as well as any other concerns they may have 
with the proposal. In particular, the Commission invites the written 
views of interested persons concerning whether the proposal is 
consistent with Section 6(b)(5) or any other provision of the Act, and 
the rules and regulations thereunder. Although there do not appear to 
be any issues relevant to approval or disapproval that would be 
facilitated by an oral presentation of views, data, and arguments, the 
Commission will consider, pursuant to Rule 19b-4, any request for an 
opportunity to make an oral presentation.\16\
---------------------------------------------------------------------------

    \16\ Section 19(b)(2) of the Act, as amended by the Securities 
Acts Amendments of 1975, Public Law 94-29 (June 4, 1975), grants the 
Commission flexibility to determine what type of proceeding--either 
oral or notice and opportunity for written comments--is appropriate 
for consideration of a particular proposal by a self-regulatory 
organization. See Securities Acts Amendments of 1975, Senate Comm. 
on Banking, Housing & Urban Affairs, S. Rep. No. 75, 94th Cong., 1st 
Sess. 30 (1975).
---------------------------------------------------------------------------

    Interested persons are invited to submit written data, views, and 
arguments regarding whether the proposed rule change should be approved 
or disapproved by April 17, 2024. Any person who wishes to file a 
rebuttal to any other person's submission must file that rebuttal by
