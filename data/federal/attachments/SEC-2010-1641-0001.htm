II. Self-Regulatory Organization's Statement of the Purpose of, and 
Statutory Basis for, the Proposed Rule Change

    In its filing with the Commission, BX included statements 
concerning the purpose of and basis for the proposed rule change and 
discussed any comments it received on the proposed rule change. The 
text of these statements may be examined at the places specified in 
Item IV below. BX has prepared summaries, set forth in Sections A, B, 
and C below, of the most significant aspects of such statements.

A. Self-Regulatory Organization's Statement of the Purpose of, and 
Statutory Basis for, the Proposed Rule Change

1. Purpose
    Recently, the Commission approved an initial fee schedule of 
existing fees for the Exchange's co-location services.\5\ This filing 
seeks to codify additional fees not included in that schedule. These 
fees are: (1) A one-time $3,000 fee for users selecting a Phase 3 2x 20 
208 volt cabinet power option; (2) a one-time $200 per shelf fee for 
additional cabinet shelves within a power cabinet; (3) a one-time $175 
fee per lock for single master key locks that allow customers to use a 
single key to access their secured equipment; and (4) a one-time per 
spout fee of $750 for cable downspouts that gather and secure cables 
entering customer equipment. All the foregoing products are provided 
only upon customer request, and the Exchange notes that use of its co-
location products and services is completely voluntary and all are 
offered on a non-discriminatory basis.

(July 2, 2010).
---------------------------------------------------------------------------

2. Statutory Basis
    The Exchange believes that the proposed rule change is consistent 
with the provisions of Section 6 of the Act,\6\ in general, and with 
Section 6(b)(5) of the Act,\7\ in particular, in that the proposal is 
designed to prevent fraudulent and manipulative acts and practices, to 
promote just and equitable principles of trade, to foster cooperation 
and coordination with persons engaged in regulating, clearing, 
settling, processing information with respect to, and facilitating 
transactions in securities, to remove impediments to and perfect the 
mechanism of a free and open market and a national market system, and, 
in general, to protect investors and the public interest. In 
particular, the filing codifies and makes transparent uniform fees 
imposed for co-location services.

    In addition, the Exchange believes that the proposed rule change is 
consistent with the provisions of Section 6 of the Act,\8\ in general, 
and with Section 6(b)(4) of the Act,\9\ in particular, in that it 
provides for the equitable allocation of reasonable dues, fees and 
other charges among members and issuers and other persons using any 
facility or system which The Exchange operates or controls. In 
particular, the Exchange notes that the use of co-location services is 
entirely voluntary and made available on a non-discriminatory basis.

    BX does not believe that the proposed rule change will result in 
any burden on competition that is not necessary or appropriate in 
furtherance of the purposes of the Act, as amended.

C. Self-Regulatory Organization's Statement on Comments on the Proposed 
Rule Change Received From Members, Participants, or Others

    Written comments were neither solicited nor received.

III. Date of Effectiveness of the Proposed Rule Change and Timing for 
Commission Action

    The foregoing rule change has become effective pursuant to Section 
19(b)(3)(A)(ii) of the Act.\10\ At any time within 60 days of the 
filing of the proposed rule change, the Commission summarily may 
temporarily suspend such rule change if it appears to the Commission 
that such action is necessary or appropriate in the public interest, 
for the protection of investors, or otherwise in furtherance of the 
purposes of the Act. If the Commission takes such action, the 
Commission shall
