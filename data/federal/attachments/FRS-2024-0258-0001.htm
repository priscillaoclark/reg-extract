PRA OMB submission, including the draft reporting form and 
instructions, supporting statement (which contains more detail about

Request for Comment on Information Collection Proposal

    The Board invites public comment on the following information 
collection, which is being reviewed under authority delegated by the 
OMB under the PRA. Comments are invited on the following:
    a. Whether the proposed collection of information is necessary for 
the proper performance of the Board's functions, including whether the 
information has practical utility;
    b. The accuracy of the Board's estimate of the burden of the 
proposed information collection, including the validity of the 
methodology and assumptions used;

information to be collected;

respondents, including through the use of automated collection 
techniques or other forms of information technology; and

maintenance, and purchase of services to provide information.
    At the end of the comment period, the comments and recommendations 
received will be analyzed to determine the extent to which the Board 
should modify the proposal.

Proposal Under OMB Delegated Authority To Extend for Three Years, 
Without Revision, the Following Information Collection

    Collection title: Policy Impact Survey.
    Collection identifier: FR 3075.
    OMB control number: 7100-0362.
    General description of collection: The Policy Impact Survey 
collects information from certain types of institutions regulated by 
the Board in order to assess the effects of proposed, pending, or 
recently adopted policy changes at the domestic and international 
levels. The Board uses the survey to collect information used for 
certain quantitative impact studies sponsored by financial stability 
bodies such as the Basel Committee on Banking Supervision and the 
Financial Stability Board. Recent collections have included the Basel 
III monitoring exercise, which monitors the global impact of the Basel 
III framework, the global systemically important bank exercise, which 
assesses firms' systemic risk profiles, and a survey of the domestic 
systemic risk footprint of large foreign banking organizations. Since 
the collected data may change from survey to survey, there is no fixed 
reporting form.
    Frequency: On occasion.
    Respondents: Bank holding companies, savings and loan holding 
companies, nonbank financial companies, and foreign banking 
organizations.
    Total estimated number of respondents: 14.
    Estimated average hours per response: 700.
    Total estimated annual burden hours: 68,600.

    Board of Governors of the Federal Reserve System, September 27, 
2024.
Benjamin W. McDonough,
Deputy Secretary and Ombuds of the Board.
