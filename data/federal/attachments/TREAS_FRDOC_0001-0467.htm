SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION:

Background

    The Convention on Cultural Property Implementation Act (Pub. L. 97-
446, 19 U.S.C. 2601 et seq.) (CPIA), which implements the 1970 United 
Nations Educational, Scientific and Cultural Organization (UNESCO) 
Convention on the Means of Prohibiting and Preventing the Illicit 
Import, Export and Transfer of Ownership of Cultural Property (823 
U.N.T.S. 231 (1972)) (Convention), allows for the conclusion of an 
agreement between the United States and another party to the Convention 
to impose import restrictions on eligible archaeological and 
ethnological material. In certain limited circumstances, the CPIA 
authorizes the imposition of restrictions on an emergency basis (19 
U.S.C. 2603). The emergency restrictions are effective for no more than 
five years from the date of the State Party's request and may be 
extended for three years where it is determined that the emergency 
condition continues to apply with respect to the covered material (19 
U.S.C. 2603(c)(3)). These restrictions may also be continued, in whole 
or in part, pursuant to an agreement concluded within the meaning of 
the CPIA (19 U.S.C. 2603(c)(4)).

Determinations

    Pursuant to 19 U.S.C. 2602(a), the government of Ukraine, a State 
Party to the Convention, requested on March 5, 2024, that import 
restrictions be imposed on certain archaeological and ethnological 
material, the pillage of which jeopardizes the cultural heritage of 
Ukraine. The CPIA authorizes the President (or designee) to apply 
import restrictions on an emergency basis if the President determines 
that an emergency condition applies with respect to any archaeological 
or ethnological material of any requesting State Party (19 U.S.C. 
2603).
    On July 26, 2024, the Assistant Secretary for Educational and 
Cultural Affairs, United States Department of State, after consultation 
with and recommendation by the Cultural Property Advisory Committee, 
made the determinations necessary under the CPIA for the emergency 
imposition of import restrictions on categories of archaeological 
material and ethnological material of the cultural heritage of Ukraine. 
The Designated List below sets forth the categories of material to 
which the import restrictions apply. Thus, U.S. Customs and Border 
Protection (CBP) is amending Sec.  12.104g(b) of title 19 of the Code 
of Federal Regulations (19 CFR 12.104g(b)) accordingly.
    Importation of covered material from Ukraine will be restricted 
until March 5, 2029, unless the conditions set forth in 19 U.S.C. 2606 
and 19 CFR 12.104c are met.

rectangular with the head outlined and other body parts shown in 
relief. Scythian sculptures schematically depict warriors. Sculptures 
from the Eneolithic and Ancient Greek periods often take the form of 
schematic human busts. Ancient Greek and Roman sculptures often depict 
naturalistic images of various figures, including humans, mythological 
creatures, and animals. Medieval nomadic stelae depict humans 
schematically, often with pointed headdresses. Approximate date: 6000 
B.C.E.-1774 C.E.

other parts of buildings. Approximate date: 650 B.C.E.-1774 C.E.
    4. Mosaics--Composed of painted pebbles, marble, limestone, and 
bricks. Floors made of painted pebbles decorated Ancient Greek-period 
inner courts and rooms. Early Christian churches in Crimea and Kyiv 
were decorated with mosaics made of marble of various colors, 
limestone, and bricks. These mosaics were crafted from small cube-
shaped stones (tesserae) measuring approximately 4-6 cm x 3-5 cm, set 
in a limestone mortar or cement. Motifs include, but are not limited 
to, geometric patterns, palmettes, depictions of people, borders with 
meanders, waves, braids, pairs of animals, and griffins. They show a

of marble and other stones and dating from the Ancient Greek and Roman 
periods. Approximate date: 650 B.C.E.-1774 C.E.
    7. Slabs with Relief Images and Inscriptions--Made of marble, 
limestone, and other local stones, these slabs have been produced since 
the Bronze Age. Locally quarried slabs are often gray, porous, and 
rough, while slabs carved in Ukraine on imported marble are white and 
gray. Motifs on Ancient Greek and Roman period slabs include humans, 
lions, sphinxes, and griffins, with reliefs sometimes combined with 
paintings. Inscriptions in various scripts, including Latin, Greek, and 
Cyrillic, are found on slabs of various shapes and sizes. Approximate 
date: 3000 B.C.E.-1774 C.E.
    8. Sarcophagi, Ossuaries, and Gravestones--Sarcophagi and ossuaries 
are usually rectangular constructions made of jointed or carved slabs; 
their lids are also included, having roof-like shapes in the Roman 
period. Sizes vary depending on purpose: for cremations or inhumations, 
they range from half a meter to several meters. Gravestones are 
typically decorated with floral ornaments, rosettes, and cornices; 
usually rectangular with roof, arch, or cone-shaped tops. Late Antique, 
Medieval, and Early Modern gravestones include those shaped as crosses, 
tree trunks, or architectural structures. Approximate date: 650 B.C.E.-

pink or blue slate or sandstone. Icons range from 5 to 25 cm in size. 
They are painted with images of single, frontally depicted, full-length 
or half-length figures of Christ, the Virgin Mary, or saints such as 
Nicholas, Theodore Stratelates, or others, or religious scenes with two 
to three figures shown frontally or in three-quarters view, such as the 
Annunciation, Presentation, Descent into Hell, and others. Icons 
usually have a frame, while crosses are sometimes set in frames made of 
other materials. Precious stones may be used in the decoration of small 
cultic objects. Approximate date: 300-1774 C.E.
    10. Vessels--Made primarily of limestone, marble, and alabaster. 
Including, but not limited to, mortars and pestles of various sizes

depict predators attacking herbivorous animals and mythological 
creatures. Small gold pendants and beads were used to decorate clothes 
of these and later nomads. Byzantine and Kyivan Rus jewelry featured 
floral and geometric designs. Medieval period pendants include moon-
shaped examples decorated with ornaments and temporal or temple rings 
of various shapes, including plain wrapped wire or featuring plates, 
pendants and ornaments. Bronze and silver fibulae of the Early Iron Age 
show a variety of forms and are much smaller than the massive Early 
Medieval fibulae shaped as anthropomorphic figurines or five-rayed 
ornaments. Approximate date: 3000 B.C.E.-1774 C.E.

Executive Orders 12866 and 13563

    Executive Orders 12866 (Regulatory Planning and Review), as amended 
by Executive Order 14094 (Modernizing Regulatory Review), and 13563 
(Improving Regulation and Regulatory Review) direct agencies to assess 
the costs and benefits of available regulatory alternatives and, if 
regulation is necessary, to select regulatory approaches that maximize 
net benefits (including potential economic, environmental, public 
health and safety effects, distributive impacts, and equity). Executive 
Order 13563 emphasizes the importance of quantifying costs and 
benefits, reducing costs, harmonizing rules, and promoting flexibility. 
CBP has determined that this document is not a regulation or rule 
subject to the provisions of Executive Orders 12866 and 13563 because 
it pertains to a foreign affairs function of the United States, as 
described above, and therefore is specifically exempted by section 
3(d)(2) of Executive Order 12866 and, by extension, Executive Order 
13563.

Regulatory Flexibility Act

    The Regulatory Flexibility Act (5 U.S.C. 601 et seq.), as amended 
by the Small Business Regulatory Enforcement Fairness Act of 1996, 
requires an agency to prepare and make available to the public a 
regulatory flexibility analysis that describes the effect of a proposed 
rule on small entities (i.e., small businesses, small organizations, 
and small governmental jurisdictions) when the agency is required to 
publish a general notice of proposed rulemaking for a rule. Since a 
general notice of proposed rulemaking is not necessary for this rule, 
CBP is not required to prepare a regulatory flexibility analysis for 
this rule.
