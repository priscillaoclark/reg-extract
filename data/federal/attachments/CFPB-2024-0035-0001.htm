SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION: 
    Title of Collection: Consumer Response Government and Congressional 
Portal Boarding Forms.
    OMB Control Number: 3170-0057.
    Type of Review: Revision of a currently approved collection.
    Affected Public: State, local, and Tribal governments; Federal 
Government.
    Estimated Number of Respondents: 60.
    Estimated Total Annual Burden Hours: 14.
    Abstract: Section 1013(b)(3)(A) of the Dodd-Frank Wall Street 
Reform and Consumer Protection Act (Dodd-Frank Act or Act) requires the 
CFPB to ``facilitate the centralized collection of, monitoring of, and 
response to consumer complaints regarding consumer financial products 
or services.'' \1\ The Act also requires the CFPB to ``share consumer 
complaint information with prudential regulators, the Federal Trade 
Commission, other Federal agencies, and State agencies.'' \2\ To 
facilitate the collection of complaints, the CFPB accepts consumer 
complaints submitted by Members of Congress on behalf of their 
constituents with the consumer's express written authorization for the 
release of their personal information. In furtherance of its statutory 
mandates related to consumer complaints, the CFPB uses Government and 
Congressional Portal Boarding Forms (i.e., Boarding Forms) to register 
users for access to secure, web-based portals. The CFPB has developed 
separate portals for congressional users and other government users as 
part of its secure web portal offerings (the ``Government Portal'' and 
the ``Congressional Portal,'' respectively).\3\
---------------------------------------------------------------------------

    \1\ Codified at 12 U.S.C. 5493(b)(3)(A).
    \2\ Dodd-Frank Act section 1013(b)(3)(D), codified at 12 U.S.C. 
5493(b)(3)(D).
    \3\ In addition to the boarding forms for congressional and 
government users, CFPB utilizes a separate OMB-approved form to 
board companies onto their own distinct portal to access complaints 
submitted against them, through OMB Control Number 3170-0054 
(Consumer Complaint Intake System Company Portal Boarding Form 
Information Collection System).
---------------------------------------------------------------------------

    Through the Government Portal, government users can view consumer 
complaint information in a user-friendly format that allows easy review 
of complaints currently active in the CFPB process, complaints referred 
to a prudential Federal regulator, and other closed/archived 
complaints.
    Through the Congressional Portal, Members of Congress and 
authorized congressional office staff can view data associated with 
consumer complaints they submit on behalf of their constituents with 
the consumer's

[[Page 59720]]

express written authorization for the release of their personal 
information. The Congressional Portal only displays information about 
complaints submitted by the individual congressional office.
    Changes in this revision reflect the requirements outlined in 12 
CFR 1070.43(b)(2) that requires a citation to the agency's legal 
authority to review, possess, and examine consumer complaints. 
Therefore, new language and fields have been added to the form.
    Request for Comments: The CFPB published a 60-day Federal Register 
notice on March 27, 2024 (89 FR 21244) under Docket Number: CFPB-2024-
0014. The CFPB is publishing this notice and soliciting comments on: 
(a) Whether the collection of information is necessary for the proper 
performance of the functions of the CFPB, including whether the 
information will have practical utility; (b) The accuracy of the CFPB's 
estimate of the burden of the collection of information, including the 
validity of the methods and the assumptions used; (c) Ways to enhance 
the quality, utility, and clarity of the information to be collected; 
and (d) Ways to minimize the burden of the collection of information on 
respondents, including through the use of automated collection 
techniques or other forms of information technology. Comments submitted 
in response to this notice will be reviewed by OMB as part of its 
review of this request. All comments will become a matter of public 
record.

Anthony May,
Paperwork Reduction Act Officer, Consumer Financial Protection Bureau.
