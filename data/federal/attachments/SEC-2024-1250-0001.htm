September 3, 2024.
    On March 13, 2024, NYSE Arca, Inc. (``NYSE Arca'') filed with the 
Securities and Exchange Commission (``Commission''), pursuant to 
Section 19(b)(1) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 (``Act'') \1\ 
and Rule 19b-4 thereunder,\2\ a proposed rule change to list and trade 
shares of the 7RCC Spot Bitcoin and Carbon Credit Futures ETF under 
NYSE Arca Rule 8.500-E (Trust Units). The proposed rule change was 
published for comment in the Federal Register on March 26, 2024.\3\

    \2\ 17 CFR 240.19b-4.
    \3\ See Securities Exchange Act Release No. 99801 (Mar. 20, 
2024), 89 FR 21104. Comments on the proposed rule change are 
available at: <a href="https://www.sec.gov/comments/sr-nysearca-2024-27/srnysearca202427.htm">https://www.sec.gov/comments/sr-nysearca-2024-27/srnysearca202427.htm</a>.
---------------------------------------------------------------------------

    On May 2, 2024, pursuant to Section 19(b)(2) of the Act,\4\ the 
Commission designated a longer period within which to approve the 
proposed rule change, disapprove the proposed rule change, or institute 
proceedings to determine whether to disapprove the proposed rule 
change.\5\ On June 20, 2024, the Commission instituted proceedings 
pursuant to Section 19(b)(2)(B) of the Act \6\ to determine whether to 
approve or disapprove the proposed rule change.\7\
---------------------------------------------------------------------------

    \4\ 15 U.S.C. 78s(b)(2).
    \5\ See Securities Exchange Act Release No. 100050, 89 FR 38932 
(May 8, 2024).
    \6\ 15 U.S.C. 78s(b)(2)(B).
    \7\ See Securities Exchange Act Release No. 100390, 89 FR 53466 
(June 26, 2024).
---------------------------------------------------------------------------

    Section 19(b)(2) of the Act \8\ provides that, after initiating 
disapproval proceedings, the Commission shall issue an order approving 
or disapproving the proposed rule change not later than 180 days after 
the date of publication of notice of filing of the proposed rule 
change. The Commission may extend the period for issuing an order 
approving or disapproving the proposed rule change, however, by not 
more than 60 days if the Commission determines that a longer period is 
appropriate and publishes the reasons for such determination. The 
proposed rule change was published for notice and comment in the 
Federal Register on March 26, 2024. September 22, 2024 is 180 days from 
that date, and November 21, 2024 is 240 days from that date.

---------------------------------------------------------------------------

    The Commission finds it appropriate to designate a longer period 
within which to issue an order approving or disapproving the proposed 
rule change so that it has sufficient time to consider the proposed 
rule change and the comment it has received in connection with the 
proposed rule change. Accordingly, the Commission, pursuant to Section 
19(b)(2) of the Act,\9\ designates November 21, 2024 as the date by 
which the Commission shall either approve or disapprove the proposed 
rule change (File No. SR-NYSEARCA-2024-27).
