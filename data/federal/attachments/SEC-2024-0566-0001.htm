SECURITIES AND EXCHANGE COMMISSION

[SEC File No. 270-647, OMB Control No. 3235-0697]


Proposed Collection; Comment Request; Extension: Form SD

Upon Written Request Copies Available From: Securities and Exchange 
Commission, Office of FOIA Services, 100 F Street NE, Washington, DC 
20549-2736

    Notice is hereby given that, pursuant to the Paperwork Reduction 
Act of 1995 (44 U.S.C. 3501 et seq.), the Securities and Exchange 
Commission (``Commission'') is soliciting comments on the collection of 
information summarized below. The Commission plans to submit this 
existing collection of information to the Office of Management and 
Budget for extension and approval.
    Form SD (17 CFR 249b-400) is required by section 13(p) (15 U.S.C. 
78m(p)) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 (15 U.S.C. 78a et seq.) 
(``Exchange Act'') and Rule 13p-1 thereunder (17 CFR 240.13p-1) and is 
filed by issuers to provide disclosures regarding the source and chain 
of custody of certain minerals used in their products. Section 13(q) 
was added by Section 1502 of the Dodd-Frank Wall Street Reform and 
Consumer Protection Act (``Dodd-Frank Act''). We estimate that, when 
used by filers to comply with section 13(p), Form SD takes 
approximately 480.61265 hours per response to prepare and is filed by 
approximately 1,009 issuers. We estimate that 75% of the 480.61265 
hours per response (360.46 hours) is prepared by the issuer internally 
for a total annual burden of 363,704 hours (360.46 hours per response x 
1009 responses).
    Form SD is also used by filers to comply with section 13(q) of the 
Exchange Act (15 U.S.C. 78m(q)) and Rule 13q-1 thereunder (17 CFR 
240.13q-1). Section 13(q) was added by section 1504 of the Dodd-Frank 
Act. Form SD is used by resource extraction issuers to disclose 
information relating to certain payments made by the issuer, a 
subsidiary of the issuer, or an entity under the control of the issuer, 
to a foreign government or the Federal Government for the purpose of 
the commercial development of oil, natural gas, or minerals. We 
estimate that, when used by filers to comply with section 13(q), Form 
SD takes approximately 296.9202 hours per response to prepare and is 
filed by approximately 414 issuers. We estimate that 75% of the 
296.9202 hours per response (222.69 hours) is prepared by the issuer 
internally for a total annual burden of 192,194 hours (222.69 hours per 
response x 414 issuers responses).
    For purposes of the Paperwork Reduction Act (``PRA''), we estimate 
that Form SD take approximately 427.1701 hours per response to comply 
with collection information requirements of sections 13(p) and 13(q) 
under the Exchange Act and is filed by 1,423 issuers. We estimate that 
75% of the 427.1701 of hours per response (320.3775 hours) is prepared 
by the issuer internally for a total annual burden of 455,897 hours 
(320.3775 hours per response x 1,423 issuers). The estimated burden 
hours are made solely for the purposes of the Paperwork Reduction Act 
and are not derived from a comprehensive or even a representative 
survey or study of the costs of Commission rules and forms.
    Written comments are invited on: (a) whether this proposed 
collection of information is necessary for the proper performance of 
the functions of the agency, including whether the information will 
have practical utility; (b) the accuracy of the agency's estimate of 
the burden imposed by the collection of information; (c) ways to 
enhance the quality, utility, and clarity of the information collected; 
and (d) ways to minimize the burden of the collection of information on 
respondents, including through the use of automated collection 
techniques or other forms of information technology. Consideration will 
be given to comments and suggestions submitted in writing within 60 
days of this publication by June 25, 2024.
    An agency may not conduct or sponsor, and a person is not required 
to respond to, a collection of information unless it displays a 
currently valid control number.

Information Officer, Securities and Exchange Commission, c/o John 
Pezzullo, 100 F Street NE, Washington, DC 20549 or send an email to:

Assistant Secretary.
