DEPARTMENT OF THE TREASURY

Office of the Secretary

31 CFR Part 1

RIN 1505-AC25

 
Privacy Act; Implementation

AGENCY: Office of Foreign Assets Control, Departmental Offices, 
Treasury.

ACTION: Final rule.

-----------------------------------------------------------------------

SUMMARY: In accordance with the requirements of the Privacy Act of 
1974, as amended, the Department of the Treasury is amending its 
regulations due to the consolidation of the existing Office of Foreign 
Assets Control (OFAC)-related systems of records by revising the number 
and title of the Privacy Act system of records for which an exemption 
has been claimed.

DATES: Effective Date: November 8, 2010.

FOR FURTHER INFORMATION CONTACT: Assistant Director, Disclosure 
Services, Office of Foreign Assets Control, Department of the Treasury, 
1500 Pennsylvania Avenue, NW., Washington, DC 20220, tel.: 202-622-2510 
(not a toll free number), or Chief Counsel (Foreign Assets Control), 
Office of General Counsel, Department of the Treasury, 1500 
Pennsylvania Avenue, NW., Washington, DC 20220, tel.: 202-622-2410 (not 
a toll free number).

SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION: Currently, one OFAC-related Privacy Act 
systems of records, DO .114--Foreign Assets Control Enforcement 
Records, is exempt from provisions of the Privacy Act pursuant to 5 
U.S.C. 552a(k)(2). Under 5 U.S.C. 552a(k)(2), the head of an agency may 
promulgate rules to exempt a system of records from certain provisions 
of 5 U.S.C. 552a if the system contains investigatory material compiled 
for law enforcement purposes. The purpose of the final rule is to 
revise the number and title of the system of records for which an 
exemption has been claimed pursuant to 5 U.S.C. 552a(k)(2) as found in 
paragraph (g)(1)(i) of Sec.  1.36 to read DO .120--Records Related to 
Office of Foreign Assets Control Economic Sanctions to reflect the 
proposed revision and consolidation of systems of records, as further 
discussed below. No new exemptions are being proposed by this document 
and the revision does not affect the scope of the records for which the 
exemption pursuant to 5 U.S.C. 552a(k)(2) is claimed.
    The action amends Sec.  1.36 by revising the title of the system of 
records listed in Paragraph (g)(1)(i) from ``DO .114--Foreign Assets 
Control Enforcement Records'' to ``DO .120--Records Related to Office 
of Foreign Assets Control Economic Sanctions.''
    These regulations are being published as a final rule because the 
amendments do not impose any requirements on any member of the public 
and do not result in any change to the scope of the records for which 
the exemption from provisions of the Privacy Act is claimed pursuant to 
5 U.S.C. 552a(k)(2). These amendments are the most efficient means for 
the Treasury Department to implement its internal requirements for 
complying with the Privacy Act.
    A proposed notice to consolidate three OFAC-related systems of 
records under the Privacy Act will be published separately in a future 
issue of the Federal Register. The proposed notice to alter the three 
systems of records will consolidate the records into the following 
system of records: Treasury/DO .120--Records Related to Office of 
Foreign Assets Control Economic Sanctions. This realignment will permit 
more precise expression of the data elements and will permit the 
published notices to serve more effectively as guides for the public in 
understanding how these individually identifiable records are 
collected, maintained, disclosed, and used.
    Pursuant to Executive Order 12866, it has been determined that this 
final rule is not a significant regulatory action, and therefore, does 
not require a regulatory impact analysis.
    Because no notice of proposed rulemaking is required, the 
provisions of the Regulatory Flexibility Act, 5 U.S.C. 601-612, do not 
apply.
