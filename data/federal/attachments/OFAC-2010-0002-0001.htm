Background

    The Iranian Transactions Regulations, 31 CFR part 560 (the 
``ITR''), implement a series of Executive orders that began with 
Executive Order 12613, which was issued on October 29, 1987, pursuant 
to authorities including the International Security and Development 
Cooperation Act of 1985 (22 U.S.C. 2349aa-9). In that Order, after 
finding, inter alia, that the Government of Iran was actively 
supporting terrorism as an instrument of state policy, the President 
prohibited the importation of Iranian-origin goods and services. 
Subsequently, in Executive Order 12957, issued on March 15, 1995, under 
the authority of, inter alia, the International Emergency Economic 
Powers Act (50 U.S.C. 1701-1706) (``IEEPA''), the President declared a 
national emergency with respect to the actions and policies of the 
Government of Iran, including its support for international terrorism, 
its efforts to undermine the Middle East peace process, and its efforts 
to acquire weapons of mass destruction and the means to deliver them. 
To deal with that threat, Executive Order 12957 imposed prohibitions on 
certain transactions with respect to the development of Iranian 
petroleum resources. On May 6, 1995, to further respond to this threat, 
the President issued Executive Order 12959, which imposed comprehensive 
trade and financial sanctions on Iran. Finally, on August 19, 1997, the 
President issued Executive Order 13059 consolidating and clarifying the 
previous orders.
    The ITR implement these Executive orders and prohibit various 
transactions, including, among others, transactions with the Government 
of Iran, a term defined in section 560.304. That definition includes:
    (a) The state and the Government of Iran, as well as any political 
subdivision, agency, or instrumentality thereof;
    (b) Any entity owned or controlled directly or indirectly by the 
foregoing; and
    (c) Any person to the extent that such person is, or has been, or 
to the extent that there is reasonable cause to believe that such 
person is, or has been, * * * acting or purporting to act directly or 
indirectly on behalf of any of the foregoing * * *.
    The phrase entity owned or controlled by the Government of Iran is 
itself defined in section 560.313 of the ITR. OFAC today is publishing 
the names of 21 persons it has determined to be the Government of Iran. 
The names of these persons will be added to Appendix A to Part 560 at a 
later date.
    It is important to note that Appendix A to Part 560 is not a 
comprehensive list of persons falling within the definition of 
Government of Iran. Even if a person is not listed in Appendix A to 
Part 560 or has not otherwise been specifically determined by OFAC to 
be the Government of Iran, if the person satisfies the definition of 
the term Government of Iran in the ITR, U.S. persons and others 
engaging in transactions subject to the ITR are prohibited from 
engaging in transactions with that person, regardless of its location, 
to the same extent they are prohibited from engaging in transactions 
with the persons listed in Appendix A to Part 560 or that have 
otherwise been specifically determined by OFAC to be the Government of 
Iran. U.S. persons and others engaging in transactions subject to the 
ITR also are prohibited from engaging in most transactions with any 
person located in Iran, even if that person does not come within the

[[Page 48563]]

definition of the term Government of Iran. Finally, a person listed in 
Appendix A to Part 560 or otherwise specifically determined by OFAC to 
be the Government of Iran also may be subject to other sanctions 
programs administered by OFAC, in which case that person's name would 
also appear in the list at Appendix A to 31 CFR chapter V or on OFAC's 
Specially Designated Nationals and Blocked Persons List (``SDN'' list), 
available on OFAC's Web site. Such a person is identified in Appendix A 
to Part 560, Appendix A to 31 CFR chapter V, or the SDN list by 
references (``tags''), located at the end of the person's listing, to 
the sanctions program(s) to which the person is subject (e.g., [IRAN] 
[NPWMD] or [IRAN] [SDGT]).
    OFAC has determined the following persons to be the Government of 
Iran:
