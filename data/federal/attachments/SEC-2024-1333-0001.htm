SECURITIES AND EXCHANGE COMMISSION

[SEC File No. 270-521, OMB Control No. 3235-0579]


Proposed Collection; Comment Request; Extension: Regulation BTR

Upon Written Request Copies Available From: Securities and Exchange 
Commission, Office of FOIA Services, 100 F Street NE, Washington, DC 
20549-2736

    Notice is hereby given that, pursuant to the Paperwork Reduction 
Act of 1995 (44 U.S.C. 3501 et seq.), the Securities and Exchange 
Commission (``Commission'') is soliciting comments on the collection of 
information summarized below. The Commission plans to submit this 
existing collection of information to the Office of Management and 
Budget for extension and approval.
    Regulation Blackout Trade Restriction (``Regulation BTR'') (17 CFR 
245.100-245.104) clarifies the scope and application of Section 306(a) 
of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act of 2002 (``Act'') (15 U.S.C. 7244(a)). 
Section 306(a)(6) [15 U.S.C.7244(a)(6)] of the Act requires an issuer 
to provide timely notice to its directors and executive officers and to 
the Commission of the imposition of a blackout period that would 
trigger the statutory trading prohibition of Section 306(a)(1) [15 
U.S.C. 7244(a)(1)]. Section 306(a) of the Act prohibits any director or 
executive officer of an issuer of any equity security, directly or 
indirectly, from purchasing, selling or otherwise acquiring or 
transferring any equity security of that issuer during any blackout 
period with respect to such equity security if the director or 
executive officer acquired the equity security in connection with his 
or her service or employment. Approximately 1,230 issuers file 
Regulation BTR notices approximately 5 times a year for a total of 
6,150 responses. We estimate that it takes approximately 2 hours to 
prepare the blackout notice for a total annual burden of 2,460 hours. 
The

issuer prepares 75% of the 2,460 annual burden hours for a total 
reporting burden of (1,230 issuers x 2 hours per issuer x 0.75) 1,845 
hours. In addition, we estimate that an issuer distributes a notice to 
five directors and executive officers at an estimated 5 minutes per 
notice (1,230 blackout period x 5 notices x 5 minutes) for a total 
reporting burden of 512 hours. The combined annual reporting burden is 
(1,845 hours + 512 hours) 2,357 hours.
    Written comments are invited on: (a) whether this proposed 
collection of information is necessary for the proper performance of 
the functions of the agency, including whether the information will 
have practical utility; (b) the accuracy of the agency's estimate of 
the burden imposed by the collection of information; (c) ways to 
enhance the quality, utility, and clarity of the information collected; 
and (d) ways to minimize the burden of the collection of information on 
respondents, including through the use of automated collection 
techniques or other forms of information technology. Consideration will 
be given to comments and suggestions submitted in writing within 60 
days of this publication by November 18, 2024.
    An agency may not conduct or sponsor, and a person is not required 
to respond to, a collection of information unless it displays a 
currently valid control number.
    Please direct your written comment to Austin Gerig, Director/Chief 
Data Officer, Securities and Exchange Commission, c/o Oluwaseun Ajayi, 
100 F Street NE, Washington, DC 20549 or send an email to:

Vanessa A. Countryman,
Secretary.
