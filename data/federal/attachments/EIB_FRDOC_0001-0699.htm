SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION:

Narrative Statement

    1. What is the purpose for establishing EXIM Watch List?
    EXIM Watch List will provide a central repository of names of 
parties that have given rise to concerns by EXIM Bank personnel with a 
purpose:
    (1) to allow EXIM Bank to collect and maintain records of entities 
and individuals who participate in, or may be anticipated to 
participate in, EXIM Bank programs or activities who for one reason or 
another have given rise to reasonable concerns by EXIM Bank personnel;
    (2) to communicate, across EXIM Bank Divisions, any concerns EXIM 
Bank personnel might have about any entities/individuals; and
    (3) to address concerns by EXIM Bank and mitigate such concerns on 
a transaction-by-transaction basis.
    2. What is the authority for maintaining EXIM Watch List?
    Authority of the Export-Import Bank Act of 1945, as amended (12 
U.S.C. 635 et seq.), Executive Order 9397 as Amended by Executive Order 
13478 signed by President George W. Bush on November 18, 2008, Relating 
to Federal Agency Use of Social Security Numbers.
    3. What is the probable or potential effect of EXIM Watch List?
    The probable or potential effect on the privacy of individuals is 
limited; access to records are restricted to individuals who have the 
appropriate clearance.
    4. What steps will we take to minimize the risk of unauthorized 
access to EXIM Watch List?
    EXIM Bank has established security and privacy protocols that meet 
the required security and privacy standards issued by the National 
Institute of Standards and Technology (NIST). Records are maintained in 
a secure, password protected electronic system that utilizes security 
hardware and software to include multiple firewalls, active intruder 
detection, and role-based access controls. EXIM Bank has adopted 
appropriate administrative, technical, and physical controls in 
accordance with EXIM Bank's security program to protect the 
confidentiality, integrity, and availability of the information, and to 
ensure that records are not disclosed to or accessed by unauthorized 
individuals.
    5. Are the routine uses for EXIM Watch List compatible with the 
purpose for which they are collected?
    The routine uses for this system of records are compatible with the 
purpose for which these records are collected. The proposed routine use 
is necessary and proper for the efficient and effective conduct of the 
Federal Government and to protect EXIM interests.
    6. Are there any OMB Control Numbers, expiration dates, and titles 
of any information collection requests (e.g., forms, surveys, etc.) 
contained in EXIM Watch List and approved by OMB under the Paperwork 
Reduction Act?
    None.
    EXIM Bank is establishing a new system of records, the Watch List. 
The Watch List is a due diligence and risk mitigation tool which acts 
as a central repository of names of parties that have given rise to 
concerns by EXIM Bank personnel. Parties are added to the Watch List 
when there is a reasonable basis to believe that the party had engaged 
in, or is associated with persons that have engaged in, either criminal 
conduct or conduct that could affect EXIM Bank adversely. The Watch 
List will be imbedded into the EXIM Online application system (``EOL'') 
and/or other application or screening systems. The Watch List is not an 
exclusion or debarment list.
