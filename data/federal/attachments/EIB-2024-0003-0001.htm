design services, licenses, catalysts, and refining equipment. The U.S. 
goods and services will be exported to Malaysia and establish 
production capacity of refined petrochemicals. There has been no 
significant change in the expected output of the facility, and the 
supported U.S. exports will enable the facility to produce 725 thousand 
metric tons per year of jet fuel, 894 thousand metric tons per year of 
light naphtha, 432 thousand metric tons per year of low sulfur fuel 
oil, 1.83 million metric tons per year of paraxylene, and 632 thousand 
metric tons per year of benzene. Production of paraxylene and benzene 
will primarily be sold to East Asia, while production of jet fuel, 
light naphtha, low sulfur fuel oil will primarily be sold regionally in 
Southeast Asia.
