SECURITIES AND EXCHANGE COMMISSION

[SEC File No. 270-36, OMB Control No. 3235-0028]


Submission for OMB Review; Comment Request; Extension: Rule 17f-
2(d)

Upon Written Request, Copies Available From: Securities and Exchange 
Commission, Office of FOIA Services, 100 F Street NE, Washington, DC 
20549-2736

    Notice is hereby given that pursuant to the Paperwork Reduction Act 
of 1995 (``PRA'') (44 U.S.C. 3501 et seq.), the Securities and Exchange 
Commission (``Commission'') has submitted to the Office of Management 
and Budget (``OMB'') a request for approval of extension of the 
previously approved collection of information provided for in Rule 17f-
2(d) (17 CFR 240.17f-2(d)),

[[Page 80969]]

under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 (15 U.S.C. 78a et seq.).
    Rule 17f-2(d) requires that records created pursuant to the 
fingerprinting requirements of Section 17(f)(2) of the Act be 
maintained and preserved by every member of a national securities 
exchange, broker, dealer, registered transfer agent and registered 
clearing agency (``covered entities'' or ``respondents''); permits, 
under certain circumstances, the records required to be maintained and 
preserved by a member of a national securities exchange, broker, or 
dealer to be maintained and preserved by a self-regulatory organization 
that is also the designated examining authority for that member, broker 
or dealer; and permits the required records to be preserved on 
microfilm. The general purpose of Rule 17f-2 is to: (i) identify 
security risk personnel; (ii) provide criminal record information so 
that employers can make fully informed employment decisions; and (iii) 
deter persons with criminal records from seeking employment or 
association with covered entities. The rule enables the Commission or 
other examining authority to ascertain whether all covered persons are 
being fingerprinted and whether proper procedures regarding 
fingerprinting are being followed. Retention of these records for a 
period of not less than three years after termination of a covered 
person's employment or relationship with a covered entity ensures that 
law enforcement officials will have easy access to fingerprint cards on 
a timely basis. This in turn acts as an effective deterrent to employee 
misconduct.
    Approximately 3,800 respondents are subject to the recordkeeping 
requirements of the rule. Each respondent maintains approximately 68 
new records per year, each of which takes approximately 2 minutes per 
record to maintain, for an annual burden of approximately 2.2666667 
hours (68 records times 2 minutes). The total annual time burden for 
all respondents is approximately 8,613 hours (3,800 respondents times 
2.2666667 hours). As noted above, all records maintained subject to the 
rule must be retained for a period of not less than three years after 
termination of a covered person's employment or relationship with a 
covered entity. In addition, we estimate the total annual cost burden 
to respondents is approximately $38,000 in third party storage costs.
    An agency may not conduct or sponsor, and a person is not required 
to respond to, a collection of information under the PRA unless it 
displays a currently valid OMB control number.
