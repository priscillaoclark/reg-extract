    General description of collection: The Federal Deposit Insurance

certain criminal offenses or who have agreed to enter into a pretrial

criminal offenses from participating in the affairs of a savings and 
loan holding company (SLHC) or any of its subsidiaries without the

---------------------------------------------------------------------------

    Current actions: On September 28, 2023, the Board published a 
notice in the Federal Register (88 FR 66844) requesting public comment 
for 60 days on the extension, with revision, of the FR LL-12. The Board 
proposed to revise the FR LL-12 by clearing two previously uncleared 
recordkeeping and disclosure requirements: (1) In order to utilize the 
exception at 12 CFR 238.86 related to employees in non-policymaking 
roles, an SLHC must maintain a list of all policymaking positions and 
review this list annually; and (2) A person who is not subject to the 
requirement to seek an exemption from the Board because their criminal 
offenses are de minimis must disclose the conviction or pretrial 
diversion or similar program to all insured depository institutions and 
other banking organizations the affairs of which he or she 
participates. The comment period for this notice expired on November 
27, 2023. The Board did not receive any comments. The revisions will be 
implemented as proposed.

    Board of Governors of the Federal Reserve System, December 19, 
2023.
Michele Taylor Fennell,
Deputy Associate Secretary of the Board.
