PRA OMB submission, including the draft reporting form and 
instructions, supporting statement (which contains more detail about 
the information collection and burden estimates than this notice), and 
other documentation, will be made available on the Board's public

Request for Comment on Information Collection Proposal

    The Board invites public comment on the following information 
collection, which is being reviewed under authority delegated by the 
OMB under the PRA. Comments are invited on the following:
    a. Whether the proposed collection of information is necessary for 
the proper performance of the Board's functions, including whether the 
information has practical utility;
    b. The accuracy of the Board's estimate of the burden of the 
proposed information collection, including the validity of the 
methodology and assumptions used;
    c. Ways to enhance the quality, utility, and clarity of the 
information to be collected;
    d. Ways to minimize the burden of information collection on 
respondents, including through the use of automated collection 
techniques or other forms of information technology; and

maintenance, and purchase of services to provide information.
    At the end of the comment period, the comments and recommendations

Proposal Under OMB Delegated Authority To Extend for Three Years, 
Without Revision, the Following Information Collection

    Collection Title: Applications for Employment with the Board of 
Governors of the Federal Reserve System.
    Collection Identifier: FR 28.
    OMB Control Number: 7100-0181.
    General Description of Collection: The FR 28 is comprised of the 
Application for Employment (FR 28a), Applicant's Voluntary Self-
Identification (FR 28s), Research Assistant Candidate Survey of 
Interests and Computer Experience (FR 28i), and Pre-Hire Conflict of 
Interest Screening Form (FR 28c).
    The Application for Employment (FR 28a) collects information to 
determine the qualifications of applicants for employment with the 
Board (such as education and training, employment record, and other 
information since the time the applicant left high school). Among other 
things, the FR 28a is used to examine, rate, or assess the applicant's 
qualifications, and to contact the applicant to arrange an interview. 
The Applicant's Voluntary Self-Identification (FR 28s) is an optional 
form that collects information on the applicant's gender, race, and 
ethnicity. The Research Assistant Candidate Survey of Interests and 
Computer Experience (FR 28i) collects information on a Research 
Assistant (RA) applicant's level of interest in various economic topics 
and experience in different data analytics/programs. The Pre-Hire 
Conflict of Interest Screening Form (FR 28c) collects information from 
external applicants after they have been selected for an interview at 
the Board regarding certain financial interests that could pose a 
conflict of interest based on the duties of the position for which they 
are applying. Although certain conflicts of interest information is 
requested on the

[[Page 78364]]

FR 28a, the FR 28c requests additional information to make sure that 
conflicts of interest are fully vetted before an applicant is employed 
at the Board.
    The information collected through the FR 28 is used to assist the 
Board in recruiting and hiring individuals for Board employment, 
retaining qualified employees, and periodically reviewing its hiring 
practices.
    Frequency: Event-generated.
    Respondents: Individuals seeking employment with the Board.
    Total estimated number of respondents: 17,150.
    Total estimated annual burden hours: 7,208.\1\
