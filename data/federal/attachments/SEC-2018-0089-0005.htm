SECURITIES AND EXCHANGE COMMISSION

[SEC File No. 270-104, OMB Control No. 3235-0119]


Submission for OMB Review; Comment Request; Extension: Securities 
Exchange Act 1934--Rule 12g3-2

Upon Written Request Copies Available From: Securities and Exchange 
Commission, Office of FOIA Services, 100 F Street NE, Washington, DC 
20549-2736

    Notice is hereby given that, pursuant to the Paperwork Reduction 
Act of 1995 (44 U.S.C. 3501 et seq.), the Securities and Exchange 
Commission (``Commission'') has submitted to the Office of Management 
and Budget this request for extension of the previously approved 
collection of information discussed below.
    Rule 12g3-2 (17 CFR 240.12g3-2) under the Securities Exchange Act 
of 1934 (the ``Exchange Act'') provides an exemption from Section 12(g) 
of the Exchange Act (15 U.S.C. 78l(g)) for foreign private issuers. 
Rule 12g3-2 is designed to provide investors in foreign securities with 
information about such securities and the foreign issuer. The 
information filed under Rule 12g3-2 must be filed with the Commission 
and is publicly available. We estimate that it takes 8.948 hours per 
response to prepare and is filed by approximately 1,386 respondents. 
Each respondent files an estimated 12 times submissions pursuant to 
Rule 12g3-2 per year for a total of 16,632 respondents. We estimate 
that 25% of 8.948 hours per response (2.237 hours per response) to 
provide the information required under Rule 12g3-2 for a total annual 
reporting burden of 37,206 hours (2.237 hours per response x 16,632 
responses).
    An agency may not conduct or sponsor, and a person is not required 
to respond to, a collection of information unless it displays a 
currently valid control number.
    The public may view background documentation for this information 
collection at the following website: <a href="http://www.reginfo.gov">www.reginfo.gov</a>. Find this 
particular information collection by selecting ``Currently under 30-day 
Review--Open for Public Comments'' or by using the search function. 
Written comments and recommendations for the proposed information 
collection should be sent within 30 days of publication of this notice 
by July 29, 2024 to (i) <a href="http://www.reginfo.gov/public/do/PRAMain">www.reginfo.gov/public/do/PRAMain</a> and (ii)

Exchange Commission, c/o John Pezzullo, 100 F Street NE, Washington, DC

    Dated: June 21, 2024.

Secretary.
