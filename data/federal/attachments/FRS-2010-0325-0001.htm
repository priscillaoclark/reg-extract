Agency Information Collection Activities: Submission for OMB 
Review; Joint Comment Request

AGENCY: Office of the Comptroller of the Currency (OCC), Treasury; 
Board of Governors of the Federal Reserve System (Board); Federal 
Deposit Insurance Corporation (FDIC); and Office of Thrift Supervision 
(OTS), Treasury.

ACTION: Notice of information collection to be submitted to OMB for 
review and approval under the Paperwork Reduction Act of 1995.

-----------------------------------------------------------------------

SUMMARY: In accordance with the requirements of the Paperwork Reduction 
Act (PRA) of 1995 (44 U.S.C. chapter 35), the OCC, the Board, the FDIC, 
and the OTS (the ``agencies'') may not conduct or sponsor, and the 
respondent is not required to respond to, an information collection 
unless it

[[Page 68857]]

displays a currently valid Office of Management and Budget (OMB) 
control number. On September 3, 2010, the agencies, under the auspices 
of the Federal Financial Institutions Examination Council (FFIEC), 
requested public comment for 60 days on a proposal to revise the 
Consolidated Reports of Condition and Income (Call Report) for banks, 
the Thrift Financial Report (TFR) for savings associations, the Report 
of Assets and Liabilities of U.S. Branches and Agencies of Foreign 
Banks (FFIEC 002), and the Report of Assets and Liabilities of a Non-
U.S. Branch that is Managed or Controlled by a U.S. Branch or Agency of 
a Foreign (Non-U.S.) Bank (FFIEC 002S), all of which are currently 
approved collections of information. No comments were received on the 
proposal. The FFIEC and the agencies will implement the revisions to 
the reports as proposed.

SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION: The agencies are proposing to revise the 
Call Report, the TFR, the FFIEC 002, and the FFIEC 002S, which are 
currently approved collections of information.
    1. Report Title: Consolidated Reports of Condition and Income (Call 
Report).
    Form Number: Call Report: FFIEC 031 (for banks with domestic and 
foreign offices) and FFIEC 041 (for banks with domestic offices only).
    Frequency of Response: Quarterly.
    Affected Public: Business or other for-profit.

OCC

    OMB Number: 1557-0081.
    Estimated Number of Respondents: 1,494 national banks.
    Estimated Time per Response: 50.15 burden hours.
    Estimated Total Annual Burden: 299,696 burden hours.

Board

    OMB Number: 7100-0036.
    Estimated Number of Respondents: 841 State member banks.
    Estimated Time per Response: 55.54 burden hours.
    Estimated Total Annual Burden: 186,837 burden hours.

FDIC

    OMB Number: 3064-0052.
    Estimated Number of Respondents: 4,800 insured State nonmember 
banks.
    Estimated Time per Response: 40.18 burden hours.
    Estimated Total Annual Burden: 771,456 burden hours.
    The estimated time per response for the Call Report is an average 
that varies by agency because of differences in the composition of the 
institutions under each agency's supervision (e.g., size distribution 
of institutions, types of activities in which they are engaged, and 
existence of foreign offices). The average reporting burden for the 
Call Report is estimated to range from 16 to 655 hours per quarter, 
depending on an individual institution's circumstances and without 
considering proposed revisions to the Call Report that the OCC, the 
Board, and the FDIC have separately proposed to implement in March 
2011.\1\

Abstracts

    Call Report and TFR: Institutions submit Call Report and TFR data 
to the agencies each quarter for the agencies' use in monitoring the 
condition, performance, and risk profile of individual institutions and 
the industry as a whole. Call Report and TFR data provide the most 
current statistical data available for evaluating institutions' 
corporate applications, for identifying areas of focus for both on-site 
and off-site examinations, and for monetary and other public policy 
purposes. The agencies use Call Report and TFR data in evaluating 
interstate merger and acquisition applications to determine, as 
required by law, whether the resulting institution would control more 
than ten percent of the total amount of deposits of insured depository 
institutions in the United States. Call Report and TFR data are also 
used to calculate all institutions' deposit insurance and Financing 
Corporation assessments, national banks' semiannual assessment fees, 
and the OTS's assessments on savings associations.
    FFIEC 002 and FFIEC 002S: On a quarterly basis, all U.S. branches 
and agencies of foreign banks are required to file the FFIEC 002, which 
is a detailed report of condition with a variety of supporting 
schedules. This information is used to fulfill the supervisory and 
regulatory requirements of the International Banking Act of 1978. The 
data are also used to augment the bank credit, loan, and deposit 
information needed for monetary policy and other public policy 
purposes. The FFIEC 002S is a supplement to the FFIEC 002 that collects 
information on assets and liabilities of any non-U.S. branch that is 
managed or controlled by a U.S. branch or agency of the foreign bank. 
Managed or controlled means that a majority of the responsibility for 
business decisions (including, but not limited to, decisions with 
regard to lending or asset management or funding or liability 
management) or the responsibility for recordkeeping in respect of 
assets or liabilities for that foreign branch resides at the U.S. 
branch or agency. A separate FFIEC 002S must be completed for each 
managed or controlled non-U.S. branch. The FFIEC 002S must be filed 
quarterly along with the U.S. branch or agency's

[[Page 68859]]

FFIEC 002. The data from both reports are used for: (1) Monitoring 
deposit and credit transactions of U.S. residents; (2) monitoring the 
impact of policy changes; (3) analyzing structural issues concerning 
foreign bank activity in U.S. markets; (4) understanding flows of 
banking funds and indebtedness of developing countries in connection 
with data collected by the International Monetary Fund and the Bank for 
International Settlements that are used in economic analysis; and (5) 
assisting in the supervision of U.S. offices of foreign banks. The 
Federal Reserve System collects and processes these reports on behalf 
of the OCC, the Board, and the FDIC.

Current Actions

    The agencies are proposing to add two items to the schedules in the 
Call Report, the TFR, and the FFIEC 002 for collecting data related to 
deposit insurance assessments and to revise the instructions for an 
existing item in these schedules effective December 31, 2010. These 
changes respond to amendments made to the Federal Deposit Insurance Act 
(FDI Act) by Section 343 of the Dodd-Frank Wall Street Reform and 
Consumer Protection Act (Dodd-Frank Act) (Pub. L. 111-203, July 21, 
2010) pertaining to the insurance of transaction accounts.
    In October 2008, the FDIC Board of Directors adopted the 
Transaction Account Guarantee (TAG) program as one of two components of 
a Temporary Liquidity Guarantee Program (TLGP).\2\ Under the TAG 
program the FDIC guarantees all funds held at participating insured 
depository institutions (beyond the maximum deposit insurance limit) in 
qualifying noninterest-bearing transaction accounts, which include 
certain interest-bearing NOW accounts. Originally set to expire on 
December 31, 2009, the TAG program has since been extended, with 
certain modifications, through December 31, 2010, with the possibility 
of an additional 12-month extension, through December 31, 2011.\3\
---------------------------------------------------------------------------

    \2\ To administer the TLGP, the FDIC Board approved an interim 
rule on October 23, 2008, an amendment to the interim rule on 
November 4, 2008, and a final rule on November 21, 2008. See 73 FR 
64179 (October 29, 2008), 73 FR 66160 (November 7, 2008), and 73 FR 
72244 (November 26, 2008), respectively.
    \3\ See 74 FR 45093 (September 1, 2009), 75 FR 20257 (April 19, 
2010), and 75 FR 36506 (June 28, 2010).
---------------------------------------------------------------------------

    Section 343 of the Dodd-Frank Act amends the FDI Act with respect 
to the insurance coverage of noninterest-bearing transaction accounts. 
These amendments take effect December 31, 2010, and require the FDIC to 
``fully insure the net amount that any depositor at an insured 
depository institution maintains in a noninterest-bearing transaction 
account,'' thereby in effect replacing the FDIC's TAG program. Section 
343 includes a definition of ``noninterest-bearing transaction 
account'' that differs from the definition of this term in the FDIC's 
TAG program regulations.\4\ In addition, the unlimited insurance 
coverage of these accounts applies to all insured depository 
institutions, not just those institutions that elected to obtain 
insurance coverage for noninterest-bearing transaction accounts through 
the FDIC's TAG program. Under Section 343, the unlimited insurance 
coverage of noninterest-bearing transaction accounts would be in effect 
through December 31, 2012.
---------------------------------------------------------------------------

    \4\ As defined in Section 343, a ``noninterest-bearing 
transaction account'' is an account ``(I) with respect to which 
interest is neither accrued nor paid; (II) on which the depositor or 
account holder is permitted to make withdrawals by negotiable or 
transferable instrument, payment orders of withdrawal, telephone or 
other electronic media transfers, or other similar items for the 
purpose of making payments or transfers to third parties or others; 
and (III) on which the insured depository institution does not 
reserve the right to require advance notice of an intended 
withdrawal.'' In contrast, under the FDIC's TAG program, the term 
``noninterest-bearing transaction account'' includes not only those 
accounts within the scope of Section 343 but also accounts commonly 
known as Interest on Lawyers Trust Accounts (or functionally 
equivalent accounts) and negotiable order of withdrawal accounts 
with interest rates no higher than 0.25 percent for which the 
institution at which the account is held has committed to maintain 
the interest rate at or below 0.25 percent.
---------------------------------------------------------------------------

    As a result of this statutory change in deposit insurance coverage 
for noninterest-bearing transaction accounts, the agencies requested 
comment on September 3, 2010 on a proposal to add two items to the 
schedules in the Call Report, the TFR, and the FFIEC 002 in which data 
are collected for deposit insurance assessment purposes (Schedule RC-O, 
Schedule DI, and Schedule O, respectively) effective December 31, 
2010.\5\ As of that report date, all insured depository institutions, 
including those institutions that had not elected to participate in the 
FDIC's TAG program, would begin to report the quarter-end amount and 
number of noninterest-bearing transaction accounts (as defined in the 
Dodd-Frank Act, not as defined in the FDIC's TAG program regulations) 
of more than $250,000. These data are needed in order for the FDIC to 
estimate the quarter-end amount of insured deposits for reserve ratio 
calculation purposes \6\ and to determine the appropriate level of the 
Deposit Insurance Fund's contingent loss reserve for anticipated 
failures of insured depository institutions. Unless the unlimited 
insurance coverage of noninterest-bearing transaction accounts under 
Section 343 of the Dodd-Frank Act is extended, the two proposed new 
items would be collected only through the December 31, 2012, report 
date.
---------------------------------------------------------------------------

    \5\ 75 FR 54227 (September 3, 2010).
    \6\ The Deposit Insurance Fund's reserve ratio is the fund's 
balance divided by estimated insured deposits.
---------------------------------------------------------------------------

    Institutions participating in the FDIC's TAG program should note 
that, for purposes of determining their TAG program assessments for the 
fourth calendar quarter of 2010 (which will be payable on March 30, 
2011), they must complete the existing TAG program data items--Call 
Report Schedule RC-O, Memorandum items 4.a and 4.b; TFR Schedule DI, 
items DI570 and DI575; or FFIEC 002 Schedule O, Memorandum items 4.a 
and 4.b, as appropriate--for the final time in their December 31, 2010, 
reports. These items capture the average daily amount and average daily 
number for the quarter of qualifying noninterest-bearing transaction 
accounts of more than $250,000 as defined in the FDIC's TAG program 
regulations.
    As a result of the unlimited insurance coverage for noninterest-
bearing transaction accounts effective December 31, 2010, the agencies 
also requested comment on September 3, 2010, on a proposed revision of 
the instructions for reporting estimated uninsured deposits in Call 
Report Schedule RC-O, Memorandum item 2; TFR Schedule DI, item DI210; 
and FFIEC 002 Schedule O, Memorandum item 2.\7\ These items are 
required to be completed by institutions with $1 billion or more in 
total assets. At present, balances in TAG program qualifying 
noninterest-bearing transaction accounts of more than $250,000 are 
treated as uninsured deposits for purposes of reporting estimated 
uninsured deposits because the TAG program was instituted as a 
component of the TLGP, which resulted from a systemic risk 
determination. Thus, TAG program insurance coverage and assessments are 
separate from the regular deposit insurance program administered by the 
FDIC. Under the Dodd-Frank Act, the extension of unlimited insurance 
coverage to noninterest-bearing transaction accounts at all insured 
depository institutions falls within the FDIC's regular deposit 
insurance program. Therefore, in response to this statutory change in 
insurance coverage, the instructions for reporting estimated uninsured 
deposits in the Call Report, TFR, and FFIEC 002 items identified above 
would be revised to indicate that balances of more than

[[Page 68860]]

$250,000 in noninterest-bearing transaction accounts (as defined in the 
Dodd-Frank Act) should be treated as insured, rather than uninsured, 
deposits. Unless the unlimited insurance coverage of noninterest-
bearing transaction accounts under Section 343 of the Dodd-Frank Act is

    The agencies received no comments on their proposal to collect the

accounts (as defined in the Dodd-Frank Act) of more than $250,000 and

in the Call Report, the TFR, and the FFIEC 002 effective December 31, 
2010. Accordingly, the agencies will implement these revisions as 
proposed, subject to OMB approval.
