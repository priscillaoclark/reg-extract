Inflation Adjustment of Civil Monetary Penalties

AGENCY: Departmental Offices Treasury.

ACTION: Final rule.

SUMMARY: The Department of the Treasury (``Department'' or

Penalties Inflation Adjustment Act of 1990, as amended by the Federal 
Civil Penalties Inflation Adjustment Act Improvements Act of 2015 
(collectively referred to herein as ``the Act''). This rule adjusts 
CMPs within the jurisdiction of two components of Departmental Offices 
for 2022 and 2023.

DATES: This rule is effective March 21, 2023.

SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION:

I. Background

    In order to improve the effectiveness of CMPs and to maintain their 
deterrent effect, the Federal Civil Penalties Inflation Adjustment Act 
of 1990, 28 U.S.C. 2461 note (``the Inflation Adjustment Act''), as 
amended by the Federal Civil Penalties Inflation Adjustment Act 
Improvements Act of 2015 (Pub. L. 114-74) (``the 2015 Act''), requires 
Federal agencies to adjust each CMP provided by law within the 
jurisdiction of the agency. The 2015 Act requires agencies to adjust 
the level of CMPs with an initial ``catch-up'' adjustment through an 
interim final rulemaking and to make subsequent annual adjustments for 
inflation, without needing to provide notice and

[[Page 16886]]

the opportunity for public comment required by 5 U.S.C. 553. This rule 
constitutes the Department's 2022 and 2023 annual adjustment. The 2015 
Act provides that any increase in a CMP shall apply to CMPs that are 
assessed after the date the increase takes effect, regardless of 
whether the underlying violation predated such increase.\1\
---------------------------------------------------------------------------

    \1\ However, the increased CMPs apply only with respect to 
underlying violations occurring after the date of enactment of the 
2015 Act, i.e., after November 2, 2015.
---------------------------------------------------------------------------

II. Method of Calculation

    The method of calculating CMP adjustments applied in this final 
rule is required by the 2015 Act. Under the 2015 Act and the Office of 
Management and Budget guidance required by the 2015 Act, annual 
inflation adjustments subsequent to the initial catch-up adjustment are 
to be based on the percent change between the Consumer Price Index for 
all Urban Consumers (``CPI-U'') for the October preceding the date of 
the adjustment and the prior year's October CPI-U. As set forth in 
Office of Management and Budget (OMB) Memorandum M-22-07 of December 
15, 2021, the adjustment multiplier for 2022 is 1.06222. Additionally, 
as set forth in OMB Memorandum M-23-05 of December 15, 2022, the 
adjustment multiplier for 2023 is 1.07745. In order to complete the 
2022 and 2023 annual adjustments, each current CMP is multiplied by the 
2022 and 2023 adjustment multipliers. Under the 2015 Act, any increase 
in CMP must be rounded to the nearest multiple of $1.
    With regard to the CMPs assessed under 31 U.S.C. 3802(a), the 
penalty assessment for 2021 ($8,212) is multiplied by 1.06222, 
resulting in a penalty of $8,723 for 2022. Multiplying $8,723 by 1. 
07745 results in a penalty of $9,399 for 2023.
    With regard to the CMPs assessed under 31 U.S.C. 333(c), the first 
penalty under this section was adjusted to $8,212 in 2021. This amount 
is multiplied by 1.06222, resulting in a penalty of $8,723 for 2022. 
Multiplying $8,723 by 1. 07745 results in a penalty of $9,399 for 2023. 
The second penalty under this section was adjusted to $41,056 in 2021. 
Multiplying this amount by 1.06222 results in a penalty of $43,611 for 
2022. Multiplying $43,611 by 1.07745 results in a penalty of $46,989 
for 2023.
    Finally, with regard to the CMP assessed under Section 104 of Title 
I, Public Law 107-297, as amended, the penalty assessment for 2021 
($1,436,220) is multiplied by 1.06222, resulting in a penalty of 
$1,525,582 for 2022. Multiplying $1,525,582 by 1.07745 results in a 
penalty of $1,643,738 for 2023.

Procedural Matters

1. Administrative Procedure Act
    The Federal Civil Penalties Inflation Adjustment Act Improvements 
Act of 2015 (Section 701(b)) requires agencies to make annual 
adjustments for inflation to CMPs, without needing to provide notice 
and the opportunity for public comment and a delayed effective date 
required by 5 U.S.C. 553. Additionally, the methodology used for 
adjusting CMPs for inflation is provided by statute, with no discretion 
provided to agencies regarding the substance of the adjustments for 
inflation to CMPs. The Department is charged only with performing 
ministerial computations to determine the dollar amount of adjustments 
for inflation to CMPs. Accordingly, prior public notice, an opportunity 
for public comment, and a delayed effective date are not required for 
this rule.
2. Regulatory Flexibility Act
    Because no notice of proposed rulemaking is required, the 
provisions of the Regulatory Flexibility Act (5 U.S.C. 601 et seq.) do 
not apply.
3. Executive Order 12866
    This rule is not a significant regulatory action as defined in 
section 3.f of Executive Order 12866.
4. Paperwork Reduction Act
    The provisions of the Paperwork Reduction Act of 1995, Public Law 
104-13, 44 U.S.C. Chapter 35, and its implementing regulations, 5 CFR 
part 1320, do not apply to this rule because there are no new or 
revised recordkeeping or reporting requirements.
