SECURITIES AND EXCHANGE COMMISSION

[SEC File No. 270-653, OMB Control No. 3235-0703]


Proposed Collection; Comment Request; Extension: Regulation SCI, 
Form SCI

Upon Written Request, Copies Available From: Securities and Exchange 
Commission, Office of FOIA Services, 100 F Street NE, Washington, DC 
20549-2736.

    Notice is hereby given that pursuant to the Paperwork Reduction Act 
of 1995 (``PRA'') (44 U.S.C. 3501 et seq.), the Securities and Exchange 
Commission (``Commission'') is soliciting comments on the collection of 
information provided for in Regulation Systems Compliance and Integrity 
(``Regulation SCI'') (17 CFR 242.1000-1007) and Form SCI (17 CFR 
249.1900) under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 (``Exchange Act'') 
(15 U.S.C. 78a et seq.). The Commission plans to submit this existing 
collection of information to the Office of Management and Budget 
(``OMB'') for extension and approval.
    Regulation SCI requires certain key market participants to, among 
other things: (1) have comprehensive policies and procedures in place 
to help ensure the robustness and resiliency of their technological 
systems, and also that their technological systems operate in 
compliance with the federal securities laws and with their own rules; 
and (2) provide certain notices and reports to the Commission to 
improve Commission oversight of securities market infrastructure.
    Regulation SCI advances the goals of the national market system by 
enhancing the capacity, integrity, resiliency, availability, and 
security of the automated systems of entities important to the 
functioning of the U.S. securities markets, as well as reinforcing the 
requirement that such systems operate in compliance with the Exchange 
Act and rules and regulations thereunder, thus strengthening the 
infrastructure of the U.S. securities markets and improving its 
resilience when technological issues arise. In this respect, Regulation 
SCI establishes an updated and formalized regulatory framework, thereby 
helping to ensure more effective Commission oversight of such systems.
    Respondents consist of national securities exchanges and 
associations, registered clearing agencies, exempt clearing agencies, 
plan processors, and alternative trading systems. There are currently 
48 respondents, and the Commission staff estimates that, on average, 2 
new respondents may become SCI entities each year, 1 of which would be 
a self-regulatory organization (``SRO''). Accordingly, Commission staff 
estimates that over the next three years there will be an average of 50 
respondents per year.
    In addition, in December 2020, the Commission adopted amendments to 
Regulation SCI in connection with updates to the national market system 
for the collection, consolidation, and dissemination of information 
with respect to quotations for and transactions in national market 
system (``NMS'') stocks (``Infrastructure Amendments''). Specifically, 
the Commission adopted a definition of ``SCI competing consolidator'' 
that will subject competing consolidators to Regulation SCI, after a 
transition period, if they are above a specified consolidated market 
data gross revenue threshold.\1\ The Infrastructure Amendments 
increased the number of respondents to the collections of information 
in Regulation SCI, and the Commission estimates that seven competing 
consolidators will meet this definition and be subject to the 
requirements of Regulation SCI.\2\
---------------------------------------------------------------------------

    \1\ See Securities Exchange Act Release No. 34-90610 (December 
9, 2020), 86 FR 18596 (April 9, 2021) (File No. S7-03-20) 
(``Infrastructure Adopting Release'').
    \2\ Some of these respondents were estimated to incur no, or 
only part of, the estimated initial burdens because they were 
already subject to Regulation SCI (i.e., as plan processors, SROs or 
affiliates of SROs).
---------------------------------------------------------------------------

    Rule 1001(a) requires each SCI entity to establish, maintain, and 
enforce written policies and procedures reasonably designed to ensure 
that its SCI systems and, for purposes of security standards, indirect 
SCI systems, have levels of capacity, integrity, resiliency, 
availability, and security, adequate to maintain the SCI entity's 
operational capability and promote the maintenance of fair and orderly 
markets. The Commission staff estimates that the total annual initial 
recordkeeping burden for 7 new respondents will be 4,511 hours, and the 
annual ongoing recordkeeping burden for all 55 respondents will be, on
