SECURITIES AND EXCHANGE COMMISSION

[SEC File No. 270-560, OMB Control No. 3235-0622]


Proposed Collection; Comment Request; Extension: Interagency 
Statement on Sound Practices

Upon Written Request, Copies Available From: Securities and Exchange 
Commission, Office of FOIA Services, 100 F Street NE, Washington, DC 
20549-2736

    Notice is hereby given that pursuant to the Paperwork Reduction Act 
of 1995 (``PRA'') (44 U.S.C. 3501 et seq.), the Securities and Exchange 
Commission (``Commission'') is soliciting comments on the existing 
collection of information provided for in the Interagency Statement on 
Sound Practices Concerning Elevated Risk Complex Structured Finance 
Transactions (``Statement'') under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 
(15 U.S.C. 78a et seq.) and the Investment Advisers Act of 1940 (15 
U.S.C. 80b et seq.). The Commission plans to submit this existing 
collection of information to the Office of Management and Budget 
(``OMB'') for extension and approval.
    The Statement was issued by the Commission, together with the 
Office of the Comptroller of the Currency, the Board of Governors of 
the Federal Reserve System, the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation, 
and the Office of Thrift Supervision (together, the ``Agencies''), in 
May 2006. The Statement describes the types of internal controls and 
risk management procedures that the Agencies believe are particularly 
effective in assisting financial institutions to identify and address 
the reputational, legal, and other risks associated with elevated risk 
complex structured finance transactions.
    The primary purpose of the Statement is to ensure that these 
transactions receive enhanced scrutiny by the institution and to ensure 
that the institution does not participate in illegal or inappropriate 
transactions.
    The Commission estimates that approximately 5 registered broker-
dealers or investment advisers will spend an average of approximately 
25 hours per year complying with the Statement. Thus, the total time 
burden is estimated to be approximately 125 hours per year.
    Written comments are invited on: (a) whether the proposed 
collection of information is necessary for the proper performance of 
the functions of the Commission, including whether the information 
shall have practical utility; (b) the accuracy of the Commission's 
estimates of the burden of the proposed collection of information; (c) 
ways to enhance the quality, utility, and clarity of the information 
collected; and (d) ways to minimize the burden of the collection of 
information on respondents, including through the use of automated 
collection techniques or other forms of information technology. 
Consideration will be given to comments and suggestions submitted by 
July 23, 2024.
    An agency may not conduct or sponsor, and a person is not required 
to respond to, a collection of information under the PRA unless it 
displays a currently valid OMB control number.
    Please direct your written comments to: David Bottom, Director/
Chief Information Officer, Securities and Exchange Commission, c/o John 
Pezzullo, 100 F Street NE, Washington, DC 20549, or send an email to:

Sherry R. Haywood,
Assistant Secretary.
