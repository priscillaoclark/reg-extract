-----------------------------------------------------------------------

SUMMARY: The Office of Foreign Assets Control (``OFAC'') of the U.S. 
Department of the Treasury is amending the Global Terrorism Sanctions 
Regulations (``GTSR'') and the Terrorism Sanctions Regulations 
(``TSR'') to expand the scope of authorizations in each of those 
programs for the provision of certain legal services. In addition, OFAC 
is adding new general licenses under the GTSR, the TSR, and the Foreign 
Terrorist Organizations Sanctions Regulations to authorize U.S. persons 
to receive specified types of payment for certain authorized legal 
services.

DATES: Effective Date: December 7, 2010.

SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION: 

Electronic and Facsimile Availability

    This document and additional information concerning OFAC are 
available from OFAC's Web site (<a href="http://www.treas.gov/ofac">http://www.treas.gov/ofac</a>). Certain 
general information pertaining to OFAC's sanctions programs also is 
available via facsimile through a 24-hour fax-on-demand service, tel.: 
202/622-0077.

Background

    OFAC administers three sanctions programs with respect to 
terrorists and terrorist organizations. The Terrorism Sanctions 
Regulations, 31 CFR part 595 (``TSR''), implement Executive Order 12947 
of January 23, 1995, in which the President declared a national 
emergency with respect to ``grave acts of violence committed by foreign 
terrorists that disrupt the Middle East peace process.'' The Global 
Terrorism Sanctions Regulations, 31 CFR part 594 (``GTSR''), implement 
Executive Order 13224 of September 23, 2001, in which the President 
declared an emergency more generally with respect to ``grave acts of 
terrorism and threats of terrorism committed by foreign terrorists.'' 
The Foreign Terrorist Organizations Sanctions Regulations, 31 CFR part 
597 (``FTOSR''), implement provisions of the Antiterrorism and 
Effective Death Penalty Act of 1996.
    OFAC is revising sections in the GTSR and the TSR that authorize 
the provision of certain legal services to expand the scope of 
authorized services. In addition, OFAC is adding a new section to the 
GTSR, TSR, and FTOSR authorizing U.S. persons to receive specified 
types of payment for certain authorized legal services. Section 594.506 
of the GTSR and section 595.506 of the TSR authorize U.S. persons to 
provide certain authorized legal services to or on behalf of persons 
whose property and interests in property are blocked under those 
regulations, provided that any payment of professional fees and 
reimbursement of incurred expenses must be specifically licensed. OFAC 
is expanding the scope of these general licenses by adding to the 
authorized legal services the initiation and conduct of legal, 
arbitration, or administrative proceedings before any U.S. federal, 
state, or local court or agency for or on behalf of persons whose 
property and interests in property are blocked under the GTSR or TSR.
    The FTOSR prohibit financial transactions involving assets, within 
the possession or control of U.S. financial institutions, in which a 
designated foreign terrorist organization or its agent has an interest. 
While the FTOSR, therefore, do not prohibit U.S. persons from providing 
legal services to designated foreign terrorist organizations or agents 
thereof, any payment for such services through a U.S. financial 
institution is prohibited. Section 597.505 of the FTOSR provides that 
OFAC may issue specific licenses, on a case-by-case basis, authorizing 
the receipt of payment of professional fees and reimbursement of 
incurred expenses through a U.S. financial institution for certain 
legal services provided by U.S. persons to designated foreign terrorist 
organizations or agents thereof.
    In specific licenses it has issued for payment of U.S. persons for 
professional services rendered and reimbursement of expenses incurred 
in connection with authorized legal services provided on behalf of 
blocked persons, OFAC has authorized several payment mechanisms. First, 
OFAC has issued specific licenses authorizing payment of fees and 
reimbursement of expenses where the funds used for such payment or 
reimbursement originate outside the United States and do not come from 
a U.S. person or any person, other than the person on whose behalf the 
authorized legal services are provided, whose property and interests in 
property are blocked. Second, OFAC has issued specific licenses 
authorizing the establishment of legal defense funds that collect 
donations from persons who are neither designated nor blocked to pay 
legal fees and reimburse expenses incurred in connection with 
authorized legal services rendered on behalf of blocked persons. With 
this rule, OFAC incorporates these mechanisms for payment into general 
licenses by adding new section 594.517 to the GTSR, new section 595.515 
to the TSR, and new section 597.513 to the FTOSR. These new sections 
authorize payments from funds originating outside the United States in 
connection with certain authorized legal services rendered to or on 
behalf of designated persons, as well as the formation of legal defense 
funds to gather donations and dispense funds in connection with 
payments for such legal services.
    In addition to the payment mechanisms discussed above, OFAC may 
issue specific licenses authorizing the release of a limited amount of 
blocked funds for the payment of legal fees and expenses incurred in 
seeking administrative reconsideration or judicial review of the 
designation of a U.S. person or the blocking of the property and 
interests in property of a U.S. person where alternative funding 
sources are not available. For more information on this third mechanism 
for payment, see OFAC's Guidance on the Release of Limited Amounts of 
Blocked Funds for Payment of Legal Fees and Costs Incurred in 
Challenging the Blocking of U.S. Persons in Administrative or Civil 
Proceedings, which is available at: <a href="http://www.treas.gov/resource-center/sanctions/Documents/legal_fee_guide.pdf">http://www.treas.gov/resource-center/sanctions/Documents/legal_fee_guide.pdf</a>.

Public Participation

    Because these amendments to 31 CFR parts 594, 595, and 597 involve 
a foreign affairs function, Executive Order 12866 and the provisions of 
the Administrative Procedure Act (5 U.S.C. 553) requiring notice of 
proposed rulemaking, opportunity for public participation, and delay in 
effective date are inapplicable. Because no notice of proposed 
rulemaking is required for this rule, the Regulatory Flexibility Act (5 
U.S.C. 601-612) does not apply.

Paperwork Reduction Act

    The collections of information related to 31 CFR parts 594, 595, 
and 597 are contained in 31 CFR part 501 (the ``Reporting, Procedures 
and Penalties Regulations''). Pursuant to the Paperwork Reduction Act 
of 1995 (44 U.S.C. 3507), those collections of information have been 
approved by the Office of Management and Budget under control number 
1505-0164. An agency may not conduct or sponsor, and a person is not 
required to respond to, a collection of information unless the 
collection of information displays a valid control number.
