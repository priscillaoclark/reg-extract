(``OFAC'') is amending its regulations to reflect amendments to the 
penalty provisions of the International Emergency Economic Powers Act 
(``IEEPA'') made by the International Emergency Economic Powers

Background

    On October 16, 2007, the President signed the Act into law as 
Public Law 110-96. Section 2 of the Act amended section 206 of IEEPA 
(50 U.S.C. 1705) by, among other things, raising the maximum civil 
penalty to an amount not to exceed the greater of $250,000 or an amount 
twice the amount of the transaction that is the basis of the violation. 
The Act also amended IEEPA's provisions relating to the imposition of 
criminal penalties.
    Accordingly, OFAC is amending the current IEEPA-based sanctions 
programs regulations to reflect the revised description of unlawful 
acts and the revised penalties prescribed by the Act. In particular, 
the amended regulations cross-reference IEEPA for the maximum civil 
penalty amount rather than specify such amount in the regulations 
themselves. OFAC posted an interim policy concerning its implementation 
of

[[Page 32651]]

the Act on its Web site on November 28, 2007, and plans shortly to 
revise its enforcement guidelines, which are also available on its Web 
site.

Executive Order 12866, Administrative Procedure Act, Regulatory 
Flexibility Act, and Paperwork Reduction Act

    Because the regulations at issue involve a foreign affairs 
function, the provisions of Executive Order 12866 and the 
Administrative Procedure Act (5 U.S.C. 553) requiring notice of 
proposed rulemaking, opportunity for public participation, and delay in 
effective date are inapplicable. In addition, OFAC finds that, because 
the rule merely amends the penalties provisions of certain sanctions 
regulations to conform with the statutory changes provided in the Act, 
good cause exists under 5 U.S.C. 553(b)(B) to waive the notice and 
public participation procedures, as well as under 5 U.S.C. 553(d)(3) to 
waive the delay in effective date. Because no notice of proposed 
rulemaking is required for this rule, the Regulatory Flexibility Act (5 
U.S.C. 601-612) does not apply.
