SECURITIES AND EXCHANGE COMMISSION

[SEC File No. 270-556, OMB Control No. 3235-0619]


Submission for OMB Review; Comment Request; Extension: Rule 163

Upon Written Request Copies Available From: Securities and Exchange 
Commission, Office of FOIA Services, 100 F Street NE, Washington, DC 
20549-2736

    Notice is hereby given that, pursuant to the Paperwork Reduction 
Act of 1995 (44 U.S.C. 3501 et seq.), the Securities and Exchange 
Commission (``Commission'') has submitted to the Office of Management 
and Budget this request for extension of the previously approved 
collection of information discussed below.
    Rule 163 (17 CFR 230.163) provides an exemption from section 5(c) 
(15 U.S.C. 77e(c)) under the Securities Act of 1933 (15 U.S.C. 77a et 
seq.) for certain communications by or on behalf of a well-known 
seasoned issuer. The information filed under Rule 163 is publicly 
available. We estimate that it takes approximately 0.375 burden hours 
per response to provide the information required under Rule 163 and is 
filed by approximately 12 issuers. We estimate that 25% of the 0.375 
hours per response (0.09375 hours) is prepared by the issuer for an 
annual reporting burden of 1 hours (0.09375 hours per response x 12 
responses).
    An agency may not conduct or sponsor, and a person is not required 
to respond to, a collection of information unless it displays a 
currently valid control number.
    The public may view background documentation for this information 
collection at the following website: <a href="http://www.reginfo.gov">www.reginfo.gov</a>. Find this 
particular information collection by selecting ``Currently under 30-day 
Review--Open for Public Comments'' or by using the search function. 
Written comments and recommendations for the proposed information 
collection should be sent within 30 days of publication of this notice 
by January 10, 2024 to (i) <a href="http://www.reginfo.gov/public/do/PRAMain">www.reginfo.gov/public/do/PRAMain</a> and (ii) 
David Bottom, Director/Chief Information Officer, Securities and 
Exchange Commission, c/o John Pezzullo, 100 F Street NE, Washington, DC 
20549, or by sending an email to: <a href="/cdn-cgi/l/email-protection#2a7a786b75674b43464845526a594f49044d455c"><span class="__cf_email__" data-cfemail="08585a4957456961646a6770487b6d6b266f677e">[email&#160;protected]</span></a>.

    Dated: December 6, 2023.
Sherry R. Haywood,
Assistant Secretary.
