A. Program Description

    The purpose of the Community Development Revolving Loan Fund 
(CDRLF) is to assist LICUs in providing basic financial services to 
their members and to stimulate economic activities in their 
communities. Through the CDRLF, the NCUA provides financial support in 
the form of technical assistance grants to eligible credit unions to 
modernize, build capacity, and extend outreach into underserved 
communities.
    The NCUA will consider requests for various funding initiatives. 
More detailed information about the purpose of each initiative, amount 
of funds available, funding priorities, permissible uses of funds, 
funding limits, deadlines, and other pertinent details will be defined 
in the Grant Round Guidelines. In addition, the NCUA may periodically 
publish information regarding the CDRLF in Letters to Credit Unions, 
press releases, and/or on the agency website, <a href="http://NCUA.gov">NCUA.gov</a>.

1. Funding Initiatives

    The funding initiatives available during 2024 include:
    i. Training;
    ii. Digital Services and Cybersecurity;
    iii. Consumer Financial Protection;
    iv. MDI Capacity Building;
    v. Underserved Outreach; and
    vi. Impact Through Innovation.

2. Authority and Regulations

    i. Authority: 12 U.S.C. 1772c-1, 1756, 1757(5)(D), and (7)(I), 
1766, 1782, 1784, 1785 and 1786; and Further Consolidated 
Appropriations Act, 2024, Public Law 118-47, Div. B, Title V (2024).
    ii. Regulations: The regulation governing the CDRLF is found at 12 
CFR part 705. In general, this regulation governs the CDRLF, and sets 
forth the program requirements. Additional regulations related to the 
low-income designation are found at 12 CFR 701.34 and 741.204. For the 
purposes of this NOFO, an ``Applicant'' is a Participating Credit Union 
that submits a complete application to the NCUA under the CDRLF. The 
NCUA encourages Applicants to review the regulations, this NOFO, the 
Grant Round Guidelines, and other program materials for a complete 
understanding of the program.

B. Award Information

    Up to $3,465,000 in awards will be available through this NOFO. The 
NCUA reserves the right to: (i) award more or less than the amounts 
cited above; (ii) fund, in whole or in part, any, all, or none of the 
applications submitted in response to this NOFO; and (iii) reallocate 
funds available under this NOFO to other programs, particularly if the 
NCUA finds that the number of awards made under this NOFO is fewer than 
projected. General information about the purpose of each funding 
initiative and the maximum award amount is provided below. Additional 
initiative information will be detailed in the 2024 Community 
Development Revolving Loan Fund Grant Round Application Guidelines 
found on the NCUA's website.

1. Purpose of Funding Initiatives

    i. Training: The training initiative aims to strengthen credit 
union management's leadership skills and promote succession planning. 
Credit unions will be able to use funds to develop a management 
succession plan or to enroll an employee in advanced training courses 
to enhance leadership skills and operational knowledge of credit 
unions. To direct grant funds to credit unions with the greatest need 
for resources, credit unions with assets in excess of $100 million are 
not eligible for funding under this initiative.
    ii. Digital Services and Cybersecurity: This initiative is intended 
to increase access to safe, fair, and affordable digital financial 
products and services. Applicants can request funding for equipment 
needed to improve their remote work posture, upgrade equipment to 
current industry standards, or implement new financial products and 
services that provide members access to the credit union without 
physical access to the branch. Cybersecurity activities include 
cybersecurity training for board members and employees, procurement of 
software and hardware required for cybersecurity upgrades, contracts 
for external security services, business continuity, development or 
implementation of an incident response plan, vulnerability scans, or IT 
auditing and testing. To direct grant funds to credit unions with the 
greatest need for resources, credit unions with assets in excess of 
$250 million are not eligible for funding under this initiative.
    iii. Consumer Financial Protection: The purpose of this initiative 
is to ensure credit unions have the resources and expertise to protect 
credit union members and consumers, raise awareness of potential 
frauds, and facilitate access to fair and affordable financial 
services. Many credit unions need additional expertise, systems, and 
support to ensure consumer financial protection. Under this initiative, 
credit unions can obtain the resources, such as consultants, to train 
staff on consumer financial protection laws and regulations. To ensure 
funds for these activities reach credit unions with the greatest need 
for resources, credit unions with assets in excess of $500 million are 
not eligible for funding under this initiative.
    iv. MDI Capacity Building: The purpose of funding initiatives for 
low-income-designated MDIs is to support and help preserve these 
institutions in furtherance of Section 308 of the Financial 
Institutions Reform, Recovery, and Enforcement Act of 1989. Low-income-
designated MDI credit unions are often challenged to fund training for 
staff and volunteers or invest in technological upgrades, growth, and 
expansion. The MDI Capacity Building initiative will provide larger 
awards to low-income designated MDIs for training, mentoring, 
implementing new products and services, strategic planning, outreach, 
opening a new service facility in an underserved community, and other 
capacity building activities. This initiative allows these credit 
unions to undertake the many activities required to grow and meet the 
unique needs of their members. Only low-income-designated credit unions 
that also have self-designated as Minority Depository Institutions as 
of the date of their grant application are eligible for funding under 
this initiative. To ensure funds for these activities reach credit 
unions with the greatest need regardless of size, no asset limitations 
will be placed on applicants for this initiative.
    v. Underserved Outreach: The Underserved Outreach initiative will 
help credit unions implement innovative outreach strategies to help 
close the wealth gap in underserved communities and for minority, 
veteran, and immigrant populations through new or expanded outreach 
efforts, such as opening a new service facility in an underserved 
community, creating financial education programs, and offering 
financial products and services. To ensure funds for these activities 
reach credit unions with the greatest need regardless of size, no asset 
limitations will be placed on applicants for this initiative.
    vi. Impact Through Innovation: The NCUA's priority for the CDRLF is 
to support the growth of credit unions and make a positive impact on 
communities that are financially underserved. Providing greater support 
will require larger awards and longer performance periods. The Impact 
Through Innovation initiative will encourage credit unions to meet 
challenges affecting underserved communities, targeting banking 
deserts, affordable housing, credit invisibles, and financial 
technologies (fintechs) in new ways. As

[[Page 22747]]

part of the 2023 CDRLF Pilot grant initiative, funds will be available 
only to credit unions that received a 2023 CDRLF Pilot grant under the 
Impact Through Innovation initiative. The Impact Through Innovation 
initiative is a multi-year award implemented as a continuation grant. 
Funds are available for the second performance period of these 
projects. Credit unions are eligible to receive funding up to $100,000 
in 2024. Subsequent awards are dependent on successful project 
performance and the availability of future congressional 
appropriations. See the 2023 Community Development Revolving Loan Fund 
Pilot Grant Application Guidelines for additional details.

2. Maximum Award Amount

    The maximum amount for a CDRLF award is determined by the funding 
initiative. There is no minimum amount for CDRLF awards. The maximum 
award amount for each funding initiative is provided below.

i. Training--$5,000
ii. Digital Services and Cybersecurity--$10,000
iii. Consumer Financial Protection--$10,000
iv. MDI Capacity Building--$50,000
v. Underserved Outreach--$50,000
vi. Impact Through Innovation--$100,000

C. Eligibility Information

1. Eligible Applicants

    This NOFO is open to low-income-designated credit unions that meet 
the eligibility requirements defined in 12 CFR part 705.
    i. Non-Federally Insured Applicants: Each Applicant that is a non-
federally insured, state-chartered credit union must submit additional 
application materials. These additional materials are more fully 
described in 12 CFR 705.7(b)(3) and in the application.
    a. Non-federally insured, state-chartered credit unions must agree 
to be examined by the NCUA. The specific terms and covenants pertaining 
to this condition will be provided in the award agreement of the 
Participating Credit Union.

2. Employer Identification Number

    Each application must include a valid and current Employer 
Identification Number (EIN) issued by the U.S. Internal Revenue Service 
(IRS). The NCUA will not consider an application that does not include 
a valid and current EIN. Such an application will be deemed incomplete 
and will be declined. Information on how to obtain an EIN may be found 
on the IRS' website.

3. System for Award Management

    All Applicants are required by federal law to have an active 
registration with the federal government's System for Award Management 
(SAM) prior to applying for funding. SAM is a web-based, government-
wide application that collects, validates, stores, and disseminates 
business information about the Federal Government's trading partners in 
support of the contract awards, grants, and electronic payment 
processes. An active SAM account status and unique entity identifier 
(UEI) number are required to apply for a CDRLF grant. Credit unions 
receive a UEI upon registration in SAM. Once registered, credit unions 
must recertify and maintain an active status annually. There is no 
charge for the SAM registration and recertification process. SAM users 
can register or recertify their account by following the instructions 
for registration. The NCUA will not consider an applicant that does not 
have an active SAM status.

4. Other Eligibility Requirements

    i. Financial Viability: Applicants must meet the grant award 
standards established by the NCUA, including those pertaining to 
financial viability, as set forth in the application and defined in 12 
CFR 705.7(b) and 705.7(c).
    ii. Compliance with Past Agreements: In evaluating funding requests 
under this NOFO, the NCUA will consider an Applicant's record of 
compliance with past agreements. The NCUA, in its sole discretion, will 
determine whether to consider an application from an Applicant with a 
past record of noncompliance, including any deobligation of funds 
(removal of unused awards).
    a. If an Applicant is in default of a previously executed agreement 
with the NCUA, the NCUA will not consider an application for funding 
under this NOFO.
    b. If an Applicant is a prior Participating Credit Union under the 
CDRLF and has unused awards as of the date of application, the NCUA may 
request a narrative from the Applicant that addresses the reason for 
its record of noncompliance. The NCUA, in its sole discretion, will 
determine whether the reason is sufficient to proceed with the review 
of the application.

D. Application and Submission Information

1. Application

    Under this NOFO, all applications must be submitted online in the 
NCUA's web-based application system, CyberGrants, to be considered. 
Applications must be submitted online at <a href="https://www.cybergrants.com/ncua/applications">https://www.cybergrants.com/ncua/applications</a>. The application and related documents are also

2. Minimum Application Content

    A complete application will consist of similar components for each 
funding initiative. At a minimum, each initiative requires a narrative 
that describes the Applicant's proposed use of the CDRLF award. The 
NCUA may waive this requirement for funding initiatives with a defined 
list of allowable project activities. The NCUA will identify the 
funding initiatives that do not require a narrative response in the 
grant round guidelines. Other application contents that are specific to 
a particular funding initiative will be defined in the grant round 
guidelines found on the NCUA's website.

3. Submission Dates and Times

    The NCUA will accept applications beginning May 1, 2024, at 9 a.m. 
Eastern. Applications must be submitted by July 1, 2024 at 11:59 p.m. 
Eastern. Late applications will not be considered.

E. Application Review Information

1. Eligibility and Completeness Review

    The NCUA will review each application to determine whether it is 
complete and that the Applicant meets the eligibility requirements 
described in the regulations, the Grant Round Guidelines, and in this 
NOFO. An incomplete application or one that does not meet the 
eligibility requirements may be declined without further consideration.

2. Evaluation Criteria

    Each funding initiative, due to its structure and impact, may have 
different evaluation criteria assigned. The evaluation criteria for 
each funding initiative are fully described in the Grant Round 
Guidelines.

3. Application Review

    The purpose of the application review is to determine whether an 
application satisfies the criteria for the applicable funding 
initiative. The NCUA will evaluate each application for adherence to 
the grant round guidelines. The NCUA may contact the Applicant during 
its review to clarify or confirm information in the application. The 
Applicant must respond within the time specified by the NCUA or the 
NCUA, in its sole discretion, may decline the

[[Page 22748]]

application without further consideration.

4. Scoring and Funding Decision

for each application. The applications will be ranked according to the 
scoring criteria set forth for each funding initiative in the Grant 
Round Guidelines.

F. Federal Award Administration

award activities. This includes, but it is not limited to, signing the 
award agreement and completing a payment request for the awarded funds. 
The payment requirements vary by funding initiative and are detailed in 
the application and post-award guidelines.
    The payment request may require, all or a combination of the 
following items: (i) certification of expenses; (ii) project related 
documentation; (iii) a summary of project accomplishments and outcomes; 
or (iv) a certification form signed by a credit union official (such as

influence a pending or future grant award, or a payment of permitted 
expenses thereunder.
    vi. An employee, contractor, consultant, or vendor of the Applicant 
would have such a ``covered relationship'' if he or she were either: 
(1) a member of the household of an NCUA employee who presently holds a 
position that would enable him or her to influence a pending or future

in breach of any condition or limitation in the grant guidelines or in 
breach of the `covered relationship' restriction set forth above.
    xiv. Information included in Outcome Summary or Success Stories is 
considered by the NCUA to be Research Data and is governed by 2 CFR

from obligating or expending loan or grant funds to procure or obtain 
equipment, services, or systems that use covered telecommunications 
equipment or services as a substantial or essential component of any 
system or as critical technology as part of any system in accordance 
with Public Law 115-232, section 889 and 2 CFR 200.216.
    xvii. Applicants receiving payment in advance must maintain both 
written procedures that minimize the time elapsing between the transfer
