    Pursuant to Section 19(b)(1) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 
(the ``Act''),\1\ and Rule 19b-4 thereunder,\2\ notice is hereby given 
that on October 22, 2024, Cboe Exchange, Inc. (the ``Exchange'' or 
``Cboe Options'') filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission

I. Self-Regulatory Organization's Statement of the Terms of Substance 
of the Proposed Rule Change

    Cboe Exchange, Inc. (the ``Exchange'' or ``Cboe Options'') proposes 
to amend its Fee Schedule. The text of the proposed rule change is 
provided in Exhibit 5.
    The text of the proposed rule change is also available on the 
Exchange's website (<a href="http://www.cboe.com/AboutCBOE/CBOELegalRegulatoryHome.aspx">http://www.cboe.com/AboutCBOE/CBOELegalRegulatoryHome.aspx</a>), at the Exchange's Office of the 
Secretary, and at the Commission's Public Reference Room.

II. Self-Regulatory Organization's Statement of the Purpose of, and 
Statutory Basis for, the Proposed Rule Change

    In its filing with the Commission, the Exchange included statements 
concerning the purpose of and basis for the proposed rule change and 
discussed any comments it received on the proposed rule change. The 
text of these statements may be examined at the places specified in 
Item IV below. The Exchange has prepared summaries, set forth in 
sections A, B, and C below, of the most significant aspects of such 
statements.

[[Page 88846]]

A. Self-Regulatory Organization's Statement of the Purpose of, and 
Statutory Basis for, the Proposed Rule Change

1. Purpose
    The Exchange proposes to update its Fee Schedule to provide a 
temporary 20% discount on fees assessed to Exchange Trading Permit 
Holders and non-Trading Permit Holders that purchase $20,000 or more of 
ad hoc purchases of historical Open-Close Data, effective October 10, 
2024 through December 31, 2024.\3\
---------------------------------------------------------------------------

    \3\ The Exchange initially filed the proposed change on October 
10, 2024 (SR-CBOE-2024-045). On October 11, 2024, the Exchange 
withdrew that filing and submitted SR-CBOE-2024-046. On October 22, 
2024, the Exchange withdrew that filing and submitted this filing.
---------------------------------------------------------------------------

    By way of background, the Exchange currently offers End-of-Day 
(``EOD'') and Intraday Open-Close Data (collectively, ``Open-Close 
Data''). EOD Open-Close Data is an end-of-day volume summary of trading 
activity on the Exchange at the option level by origin (customer, 
professional customer, broker-dealer, and market maker), side of the 
market (buy or sell), price, and transaction type (opening or closing). 
The customer and professional customer volume is further broken down 
into trade size buckets (less than 100 contracts, 100-199 contracts, 
greater than 199 contracts). The EOD Open-Close Data is proprietary 
Exchange trade data and does not include trade data from any other 
exchange. It is also a historical data product and not a real-time data 
feed. The Exchange also offers Intraday Open-Close Data, which provides 
similar information to that of EOD Open-Close Data but is produced and 
updated every 10 minutes during the trading day. Data is captured in 
``snapshots'' taken every 10 minutes throughout the trading day and is 
available to subscribers within five minutes of the conclusion of each 
10-minute period.\4\ The Intraday Open-Close Data provides a volume 
summary of trading activity on the Exchange at the option level by 
origin (customer, professional customer, broker-dealer, and market 
maker), side of the market (buy or sell), and transaction type (opening 
or closing). The customer and professional customer volume are further 
broken down into trade size buckets (less than 100 contracts, 100-199 
contracts, greater than 199 contracts). The Intraday Open-Close Data is 
proprietary Exchange trade data and does not include trade data from 
any other exchange. All Open-Close Data products are completely 
voluntary products, in that the Exchange is not required by any rule or 
regulation to make this data available and that potential customers may 
purchase it on an ad-hoc basis only if they voluntarily choose to do 
so.
---------------------------------------------------------------------------

    \4\ For example, subscribers to the intraday product will 
receive the first calculation of intraday data by approximately 9:42 
a.m. ET, which represents data captured from 9:30 a.m. to 9:40 a.m. 
Subscribers will receive the next update at 9:52 a.m., representing 
the data previously provided together with data captured from 9:40 
a.m. through 9:50 a.m., and so forth. Each update will represent the 
aggregate data captured from the current ``snapshot'' and all 
previous ``snapshots.''
---------------------------------------------------------------------------

    Cboe LiveVol, LLC (``LiveVol''), a wholly owned subsidiary of the 
Exchange's parent company, Cboe Global Markets, Inc., makes the Open-
Close Data available for purchase to Trading Permit Holders and non-
Trading Permit Holders on the LiveVol DataShop website 
(<a href="http://datashop.cboe.com">datashop.cboe.com</a>). Customers may currently purchase Open-Close Data 
on a subscription basis (monthly or annually) or by ad hoc request for 
a specified month (historical file, e.g., request for Intraday Open-
Close Data for month of June 2024 or End-of-Day Open-Close Data for 
month of June 2024). An ad-hoc request can be for any number of months 
for which the data is available.
    Open-Close Data is subject to direct competition from similar end-
of-day and intraday options trading summaries offered by several other 
options exchanges.\5\ All of these exchanges offer essentially the same 
end-of-day and intraday options trading summary information.
---------------------------------------------------------------------------

    \5\ These substitute products are: Nasdaq PHLX Options Trade 
Outline, Nasdaq Options Trade Outline, ISE Profile, GEMX Trade 
Profile data; open-close data from C2, EDGX, and BZX; Open Close 
Reports from MIAX Options, Pearl, and Emerald; and NYSE Options 
Open-Close Volume Summary.
---------------------------------------------------------------------------

    The Exchange proposes to provide a temporary pricing incentive 
program in which Trading Permit Holders or non-Trading Permit Holders 
that purchase historical Open-Close Data will receive a percentage fee 
discount where specific purchase thresholds are met. Specifically, the 
Exchange proposes to provide a temporary 20% discount for ad-hoc 
purchases of historical Open-Close Data of $20,000 or more.\6\ The 
proposed program will apply to all market participants irrespective of 
whether the market participant is a new or current purchaser; however, 
the discount cannot be combined with any other discounts offered by the 
Exchange, including the academic discount provided for Qualifying 
Academic Purchasers of historical Open-Close Data. The Exchange intends 
to introduce the discount program beginning October 10, 2024, with the 
program remaining in effect through December 31, 2024. The Exchange 
also notes that it previously adopted the same temporary discount 
program and proposes to update the Fees Schedule with the new program 
dates accordingly.\7\
---------------------------------------------------------------------------

    \6\ The discount will apply on an order-by-order basis. To 
qualify for the discount, an order must contain End-of-Day Ad-hoc 
Requests (historical data) and/or Intraday Ad-hoc Requests 
(historical data) and must total $20,000 or more; the Exchange will 
not aggregate purchases made throughout a billing cycle for purposes 
of the incentive program. The discount will apply to the total 
purchase price, once the $20,000 minimum purchase is satisfied (for 
example, a qualifying order of $25,000 would be discounted to 
$20,000, i.e., receive a 20% discount of $5,000).

2023), 88 FR 84002 (December 1, 2023) (SR-CBOE-2023-061) and 
Securities Exchange Act Release No. 100370 (June 18, 2024), 89 FR 
53148 (June 25, 2024) (SR-CBOE-2024-025).
---------------------------------------------------------------------------

2. Statutory Basis
    The Exchange believes the proposed rule change is consistent with 
the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 (the ``Act'') and the rules and 
regulations thereunder applicable to the Exchange and, in particular, 
the requirements of Section 6(b) of the Act.\8\ Specifically, the 
Exchange believes the proposed rule change is consistent with the 
Section 6(b)(5) \9\ requirements that the rules of an exchange be 
designed to prevent fraudulent and manipulative acts and practices, to 
promote just and equitable principles of trade, to foster cooperation 
and coordination with persons engaged in regulating, clearing, 
settling, processing information with respect to, and facilitating 
transactions in securities, to remove impediments to and perfect the 
mechanism of a free and open market and a national market system, and, 
in general, to protect investors and the public interest. Additionally, 
the Exchange believes the proposed rule change is consistent with the 
Section 6(b)(5) \10\ requirement that the rules of an exchange not be 
designed to permit unfair discrimination between customers, issuers, 
brokers, or dealers.

    \9\ 15 U.S.C. 78f(b)(5).
    \10\ Id.
---------------------------------------------------------------------------

    In adopting Regulation NMS, the Commission granted self-regulatory 
organizations (``SROs'') and broker-dealers increased authority and 
flexibility to offer new and unique market data to the public. It was 
believed that this authority would expand the amount of data available 
to consumers, and also spur innovation and competition for the 
provision of market data. The Exchange believes the proposed fee 
changes will further broaden the availability of U.S. option market 
data to investors consistent with the principles of Regulation NMS.

[[Page 88847]]

Open-Close Data is designed to help investors understand underlying 
market trends to improve the quality of investment decisions. Indeed, 
purchasers of the data may be able to enhance their ability to analyze 
option trade and volume data and create and test trading models and 
analytical strategies. The Exchange believes Open-Close Data provides a 
valuable tool that purchasers can use to gain comprehensive insight 
into the trading activity in a particular series, but also emphasizes 
such data is not necessary for trading and as noted above, is entirely 
optional. Moreover, several other exchanges offer a similar data 
product which offer same type of data content through end-of-day or 
intraday reports.\11\
---------------------------------------------------------------------------

    \11\ See supra note 5.
---------------------------------------------------------------------------

    The Exchange also operates in a highly competitive environment. 
Indeed, there are currently 17 registered options exchanges that trade 
options. Based on publicly available information, no single options 
exchange has more than 18% of the market share.\12\ The Commission has 
repeatedly expressed its preference for competition over regulatory 
intervention in determining prices, products, and services in the 
securities markets. Particularly, in Regulation NMS, the Commission 
highlighted the importance of market forces in determining prices and 
SRO revenues and, also, recognized that current regulation of the 
market system ``has been remarkably successful in promoting market 
competition in its broader forms that are most important to investors 
and listed companies.'' \13\ Making similar data products available to 
market participants fosters competition in the marketplace, and 
constrains the ability of exchanges to charge supracompetitive fees. In 
the event that a market participant views one exchange's data product 
as more or less attractive than the competition they can and do switch 
between similar products. The proposed fees are a result of the 
competitive environment, as the Exchange seeks to adopt fees to attract 
purchasers of historical Open-Close Data.
---------------------------------------------------------------------------

    \12\ See Cboe Global Markets U.S. Options Market Month-to-Date 
Volume Summary (September 30, 2024), available at <a href="https://markets.cboe.com/us/options/market_statistics/">https://markets.cboe.com/us/options/market_statistics/</a>.
    \13\ See Securities Exchange Act Release No. 51808 (June 9, 
2005), 70 FR 37496, 37499 (June 29, 2005) (``Regulation NMS Adopting 
Release'').
---------------------------------------------------------------------------

    The Exchange believes that the proposed incentive program for any 
Trading Permit Holder or non-Trading Permit Holder who purchases 
historical Open-Close Data is reasonable because such purchasers would 
receive a 20% discount for purchasing $20,000 or more worth of 
historical Open-Close Data. The Exchange believes the proposed discount 
is reasonable as it will give purchasers the ability to use and test 
the historical Open-Close Data at a discounted rate, prior to 
purchasing additional months or a monthly subscription, and will 
therefore encourage and promote users to purchase the historical Open-
Close Data. Further, the proposed discount is intended to promote 
increased use of the Exchange's historical Open-Close Data by defraying 
some of the costs a purchaser would ordinarily have to expend before 
using the data product. The Exchange believes that the proposed 
discount is equitable and not unfairly discriminatory because it will 
apply equally to all Trading Permit Holders and non-Trading Permit 
Holders who purchase historical Open-Close Data. Lastly, the purchase 
of this data product is discretionary and not compulsory. Indeed, no 
market participant is required to purchase the historical Open-Close 
Data, and the Exchange is not required to make the historical Open-
Close Data available to all investors. Potential purchasers may request 
the data at any time if they believe it to be valuable or may decline 
to purchase such data. As noted above, the Exchange has previously 
adopted this discount program at other times.\14\
---------------------------------------------------------------------------

    \14\ See Securities Exchange Act Release No. 99028 (November 28, 
2023), 88 FR 84002 (December 1, 2023) (SR-CBOE-2023-061) and 
Securities Exchange Act Release No. 100370 (June 18, 2024), 89 FR 
53148 (June 25, 2024) (SR-CBOE-2024-025).
---------------------------------------------------------------------------

B. Self-Regulatory Organization's Statement on Burden on Competition

    The Exchange does not believe that the proposed rule change will 
impose any burden on competition that is not necessary or appropriate 
in furtherance of the purposes of the Act. The Exchange operates in a 
highly competitive environment in which the Exchange must continually 
adjust its fees to remain competitive. Because competitors are free to 
modify their own fees in response, including the adoption of similar 
discounts to those fees, the Exchange believes that the degree to which 
fee changes (including discounts and rebates) in this market may impose 
any burden on competition is extremely limited. As discussed above, 
Open-Close Data is subject to direct competition from several other 
options exchanges that offer substitutes to Open-Close Data. Moreover, 
purchase of Open-Close Data is optional. It is designed to help 
investors understand underlying market trends to improve the quality of 
investment decisions, but is not necessary to execute a trade.
    The proposed rule changes are grounded in the Exchange's efforts to 
compete more effectively. In this competitive environment, potential 
purchasers are free to choose which, if any, similar product to 
purchase to satisfy their need for market information. As a result, the 
Exchange believes this proposed rule change permits fair competition 
among national securities exchanges. Further, the Exchange believes 
that these changes will not cause any unnecessary or inappropriate 
burden on intermarket competition, as the proposed incentive program 
applies uniformly to any purchaser of historical Open-Close Data.

C. Self-Regulatory Organization's Statement on Comments on the Proposed 
Rule Change Received From Members, Participants, or Others

    The Exchange neither solicited nor received comments on the 
proposed rule change.

III. Date of Effectiveness of the Proposed Rule Change and Timing for 
Commission Action

    The foregoing rule change has become effective pursuant to Section 
19(b)(3)(A) of the Act \15\ and paragraph (f) of Rule 19b-4 \16\ 
thereunder. At any time within 60 days of the filing of the proposed 
rule change, the Commission summarily may temporarily suspend such rule 
change if it appears to the Commission that such action is necessary or 
appropriate in the public interest, for the protection of investors, or 
otherwise in furtherance of the purposes of the Act. If the Commission 
takes such action, the Commission will institute proceedings to 
determine whether the proposed rule change should be approved or 
disapproved.
