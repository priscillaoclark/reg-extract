I. Self-Regulatory Organization's Statement of the Terms of Substance 
of the Proposed Rule Change

    The MSRB filed with the Commission a proposed rule change 
consisting of an Amended and Restated Articles of Incorporation.
    The text of the proposed rule change is available on the MSRB's Web 
site at <A HREF="http://frwebgate.access.gpo.gov/cgi-bin/leaving.cgi?from=leavingFR.html&log=linklog&to=http://www.msrb.org/msrb1/sec.asp">http://www.msrb.org/msrb1/sec.asp</A>, at the MSRB's principal 
office, and at the Commission's Public Reference Room.

II. Self-Regulatory Organization's Statement of the Purpose of, and 
Statutory Basis for, the Proposed Rule Change

    In its filing with the Commission, the MSRB included statements 
concerning the purpose of and basis for the proposed rule change and 
discussed any comments it received on the proposed rule change. The 
text of these statements may be examined at the places specified in 
Item IV below. The Board has prepared summaries, set forth in Sections 
A, B, and C below, of the most significant aspects of such statements.

A. Self-Regulatory Organization's Statement of the Purpose of, and 
Statutory Basis for, the Proposed Rule Change

 1. Purpose
    The purpose of the proposed rule change is to make changes to the 
MSRB's Articles of Incorporation as are necessary and appropriate in 
order to comply with Section 15B of the Act, as amended by the Dodd-
Frank Wall Street Reform and Consumer Protection Act \5\ (the ``Dodd-
Frank Act''), and to reflect its expanded mission and rulemaking 
authority. On July 21, 2010, the Dodd-Frank Act, was signed into law by 
President Obama. This comprehensive financial reform legislation 
contains various provisions that affect the governance and mandate of 
the MSRB. The effective date of these provisions is October 1, 2010, 
which coincides with the first day of the MSRB's 2011 fiscal year. 
Regarding the jurisdiction of the MSRB, the Dodd-Frank Act, for the 
first time, provides the MSRB with rulemaking authority over municipal 
advisors. The proposed amendments to the Articles of Incorporation 
reflect the expanded jurisdiction of the MSRB and, therefore, delete 
specific references to brokers, dealers, and municipal securities 
dealers. Rather, the Articles of Incorporation refer generally to 
Section 15B of the Act, which is modified by the Dodd-Frank Act, 
effective October 1, 2010, and the obligations of the Board under the 
Act. Additionally, the Articles of Incorporation now provide that Board 
members elected for fiscal year 2011 will have two year terms and all 
other Board members will have three year terms to reflect the new, 
expanded composition of the Board and the terms of office for Board 
members. Finally, the changes to the Purpose section reflect the 
evolving role of the MSRB as a self-regulatory organization in 
providing education, outreach and market leadership regarding issues 
that impact the municipal securities market. The MSRB is a Virginia 
nonprofit, nonstock corporation, and the Amended and Restated Articles 
of Incorporation have been filed concurrently with the State 
Corporation Commission of the Commonwealth of Virginia.

---------------------------------------------------------------------------

2. Statutory Basis
    The MSRB believes that the proposed rule change to its Articles of 
Incorporation are [sic] necessary and appropriate in order to comply 
with Section 15B of the Act, as amended by

[[Page 63888]]

the Dodd-Frank Act, as more fully described above.

B. Self-Regulatory Organization's Statement on Burden on Competition

    The MSRB does not believe that the proposed rule change will impose 
any burden on competition not necessary or appropriate in furtherance 
of the purposes of the Act, since it solely concerns the administration 
of the MSRB.

C. Self-Regulatory Organization's Statement on Comments Received on the 
Proposed Rule Change by Members, Participants, or Others

    Written comments were neither solicited nor received on the 
proposed rule change.

III. Date of Effectiveness of the Proposed Rule Change and Timing for 
Commission Action

    The proposed rule change has become effective pursuant to Section 
19(b)(3)(A)(iii) of the Act \6\ and Rule 19b-4(f)(3) \7\ thereunder, 
because it is concerned solely with the operation and administration of 
the MSRB. At any time within 60 days of the filing of the proposed rule 
change, the Commission summarily may temporarily suspend such rule 
change if it appears to the Commission that such action is necessary or 
appropriate in the public interest, for the protection of investors, or 
otherwise in furtherance of the purposes of the Act.\8\
