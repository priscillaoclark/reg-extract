SECURITIES AND EXCHANGE COMMISSION

[SEC File No. 270-149, OMB Control No. 3235-0130]


Proposed Collection; Comment Request; Extension: Rule 17Ad-2(c), 
(d), and (h)

Upon Written Request, Copies Available From: Securities and Exchange 
Commission, Office of FOIA Services, 100 F Street NE, Washington, DC 
20549-2736

    Notice is hereby given that pursuant to the Paperwork Reduction Act 
of 1995 (``PRA'') (44 U.S.C. 3501 et seq.), the Securities and Exchange 
Commission (``Commission'') is soliciting comments on the existing 
collection of information provided for in Rule 17Ad-2(c), (d), and (h), 
(17 CFR 240.17Ad-2(c), (d), and (h)), under the Securities Exchange Act 
of 1934 (15 U.S.C. 78a et seq.). The Commission plans to submit this 
existing collection of information to the Office of Management and 
Budget (``OMB'') for extension and approval.
    Rule 17Ad-2(c),(d), and (h) enumerates the requirements with which 
transfer agents must comply to inform the Commission or the appropriate 
regulator of a transfer agent's failure to meet the minimum performance 
standards set by the Commission rule by filing a notice.
    While it is estimated that there are 740 transfer agents, only 
approximately three notices pursuant to Rule 17Ad-2(c), (d), and (h) 
are filed annually. In view of (a) the readily available nature of most 
of the information required to be included in the notice (since that 
information must be compiled and retained pursuant to other Commission 
rules); (b) the summary fashion in which such information must be 
presented in the notice (most notices are one page or less in length); 
and (c) the experience of the staff regarding the notices, the 
Commission staff estimates that, on the average, most notices require 
approximately one-half hour to prepare. The Commission staff thus 
estimates that transfer agents spend an average of a total of one and a 
half hours per year complying with the rule (3 x .5 hours = 1.5 hours).
    Written comments are invited on: (a) whether the proposed 
collection of information is necessary for the proper performance of 
the functions of the Commission, including whether the information 
shall have practical utility; (b) the accuracy of the Commission's 
estimates of the burden of the proposed collection of information; (c) 
ways to enhance the quality, utility, and clarity of the information 
collected; and (d) ways to minimize the burden of the collection of 
information on respondents, including through the use of automated 
collection techniques or other forms of information technology. 
Consideration will be given to comments and suggestions submitted by 
December 23, 2024.
    An agency may not conduct or sponsor, and a person is not required 
to respond to, a collection of information under the PRA unless it 
displays a currently valid OMB control number.
    Please direct your written comments to: Austin Gerig, Director/
Chief Data Officer, Securities and Exchange Commission, c/o Tanya 
Ruttenberg, 100 F Street NE, Washington, DC 20549, or send an email to:

    Dated: October 16, 2024.
Sherry R. Haywood,
Assistant Secretary.
