SECURITIES AND EXCHANGE COMMISSION

[SEC File No. 270-135, OMB Control No. 3235-0176]


Submission for OMB Review; Comment Request; Extension: Rules 8b-1 
to 8b-5; 8b-10 to 8b-22; and 8b-25 to 8b-31

Upon Written Request, Copies Available From: Securities and Exchange 
Commission, Office of FOIA Services, 100 F Street NE, Washington, DC 
20549-2736

    Notice is hereby given that, pursuant to the Paperwork Reduction 
Act of 1995 (44 U.S.C. 3501 et seq.), the Securities and Exchange 
Commission (the ``Commission'') has submitted to the Office of 
Management and Budget (``OMB'') a request for extension of the 
previously approved collection of information discussed below.
    Rules 8b-1 to 8b-5; 8b-10 to 8b-22; and 8b-25 to 8b-31 (``rules 
under Section 8(b)'') (17 CFR 270.8b-1 to 8b-31) under the Investment 
Company Act of 1940 (15 U.S.C. 80a-1 et seq.) (``Investment Company 
Act'') set forth the procedures for preparing and filing a registration 
statement under the Investment Company Act. These procedures are 
intended to facilitate the registration process. These rules generally 
do not require respondents to report information.\1\
---------------------------------------------------------------------------

    \1\ Although the rules under Section 8(b) of the Investment 
Company Act are generally procedural in nature, two of the rules 
require respondents to disclose some limited information. Rule 8b-3 
(17 CFR 270.8b-3) provides that whenever a registration form 
requires the title of securities to be stated, the registrant must 
indicate the type and general character of the securities to be 
issued. Rule 8b-22 (17 CFR 270.8b-22) provides that if the existence 
of control is open to reasonable doubt, the registrant may disclaim 
the existence of control, but it must state the material facts 
pertinent to the possible existence of control. The information 
required by both of these rules is necessary to ensure that 
investors have clear and complete information upon which to base an 
investment decision.
---------------------------------------------------------------------------

    The Commission believes that it is appropriate to estimate the 
total respondent burden associated with preparing each registration 
statement form rather than attempt to isolate the impact of the 
procedural instructions under Section 8(b) of the Investment Company 
Act, which impose burdens only in the context of the preparation of the 
various registration statement forms. Accordingly, the Commission is 
not submitting a separate burden estimate for the rules under Section 
8(b), but instead will include the burden for these rules in its 
estimates of burden for each of the registration forms under the 
Investment Company Act. The Commission is, however, submitting an 
hourly burden estimate of one hour for administrative purposes.
    The collection of information under the rules under Section 8(b) is 
mandatory. The information provided under the rules under Section 8(b) 
is not kept confidential. An agency may not conduct or sponsor, and a 
person is not required to respond to, a collection of information 
unless it displays a currently valid OMB control number.
