SECURITIES AND EXCHANGE COMMISSION

[SEC File No. 270-172, OMB Control No. 3235-0169]


Submission for OMB Review; Comment Request; Extension: Form N-5

Upon Written Request, Copies Available From: Securities and Exchange 
Commission, Office of FOIA Services, 100 F Street NE, Washington, DC 
20549-2736

    Notice is hereby given that, pursuant to the Paperwork Reduction 
Act of 1995 (44 U.S.C. 3501 et seq.), the Securities and Exchange 
Commission (the ``Commission'') has submitted to the Office of 
Management and Budget (``OMB'') a request for extension of the 
previously approved collection of information discussed below.
    Form N-5 (17 CFR 239.24 and 274.5) is the form used by small 
business investment companies (``SBICs'') to register their securities 
under the Securities Act of 1933 (15 U.S.C. 77a et seq.) (``Securities 
Act'') and the Investment Company Act of 1940 (15 U.S.C. 80a-1 et seq.) 
(``Investment Company Act''). Form N-5 is the registration statement 
form adopted by the Commission for use by an SBIC that has been 
licensed as such under the Small Business Investment Act of 1958 or 
which has received the preliminary approval of the Small Business 
Administration (``SBA'') and has been notified by the SBA that the 
company may submit a license application Form N-5 is an integrated 
registration form and may be used as the registration statement under 
both the Securities Act and the Investment Company Act. The purpose of 
Form N-5 is to meet the filing and disclosure requirements of both the 
Securities Act and Investment Company Act, and to provide investors 
with information sufficient to evaluate an investment in an SBIC. The 
information that is required to be filed with the Commission permits 
verification of compliance with securities law requirements and assures 
the public availability and dissemination of the information.
    The Commission did not receive any filings on Form N-5 in the last 
three years (or in the three years before that). Nevertheless, for 
purposes of this PRA, we conservatively estimate that at least one Form 
N-5 will be filed in the next three years, which translates to about 
0.333 filings on Form N-5 per year. The currently approved internal 
burden of Form N-5 is 352 hours per response. We continue to believe 
this estimate for Form N-5's internal hour burden is appropriate. 
Therefore, the number of currently approved aggregate burden hours, 
when calculated using the current estimate for number of filings, is 
about 117 internal hours per year.
    The currently approved external cost burden of Form N-5 is $12,524 
per filing. The requested external cost burden for filing one Form N-5 
would be $14,746 per year. This estimated burden is based on the 
estimated wage rate of $584/hour, for 25.25 hours, for outside legal 
services to complete the form and provide the required hyperlinks.
    Estimates of average burden hours and costs are made solely for the 
purposes of the Paperwork Reduction Act, and are not derived from a 
comprehensive or even representative survey or study of the costs of 
Commission rules and forms. Compliance with the collection of 
information requirements of Form N-5 is mandatory. Responses to the 
collection of information will not be kept confidential. An agency may 
not conduct or sponsor, and a person is not required to respond to, a 
collection of information unless it displays a currently valid OMB 
control number.

collection at the following website: <a href="http://www.reginfo.gov">www.reginfo.gov</a>. Find this 
particular information collection by selecting ``Currently under 30-day 
Review--Open for Public Comments'' or by using the search function.

collection should be sent within 30 days of publication of this notice 
by October 21, 2024 to (i) <a href="/cdn-cgi/l/email-protection#97dad5cfb9d8dad5b9d8dec5d6b9c4d2d4c8f3f2e4fcc8f8f1f1fef4f2e5d7f8faf5b9f2f8e7b9f0f8e1"><span class="__cf_email__" data-cfemail="58151a007617151a7617110a19760b1d1b073c3d2b3307373e3e313b3d2a1837353a763d3728763f372e">[email&#160;protected]</span></a>
