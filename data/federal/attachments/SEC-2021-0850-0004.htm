SECURITIES AND EXCHANGE COMMISSION

[SEC File No. 270-629, OMB Control No. 3235-0719]


Submission for OMB Review; Comment Request; Extension: Rule 13n-
1--13n-12; Form SDR

Upon Written Request, Copies Available From: Securities and Exchange 
Commission, Office of FOIA Services, 100 F Street NE, Washington, DC 
20549-2736

    Notice is hereby given that pursuant to the Paperwork Reduction Act 
of 1995 (``PRA'') (44 U.S.C. 3501 et seq.), the Securities and Exchange 
Commission (``Commission'') has submitted to the Office of Management 
and Budget (``OMB'') a request for approval of extension of the 
previously approved collection of information provided for in Rules 
13n-1 through 13n-12 (17 CFR 240.13n-1 through 240.13n-12) and Form SDR 
(``Rules''), under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 (15 U.S.C. 
78m(n)(3) et seq.).
    Under the Rules, security-based swap data repositories (``SDRs'') 
are required to register with the Commission by filing a completed Form 
SDR (the filing of a completed Form SDR also constitutes an application 
for registration as a securities information processor (``SIP'')). SDRs 
are also required to abide by certain minimum standards set out in the 
Rules, including a requirement to update Form SDR, abide by certain 
duties and core principles, maintain data in accordance with the rules, 
keep systems in accordance with the Rules, keep records, provide 
reports to the Commission, maintain the privacy of security-based swaps 
(``SBSs'') data, make certain disclosures, and designate a Chief 
Compliance Officer. In addition, there are a number of collections of 
information contained in the Rules. The information collected pursuant 
to the Rules is necessary to carry out the mandates of the Dodd-Frank 
Act and help ensure an orderly and transparent market for SBSs.
    Assuming a maximum of three SDRs, the Commission estimates that the 
total that the total burden for the Rules and Form SDR for all 
respondents is 127,505 hours annually and approximately 382,511 burden 
hours for all respondents over three years. In addition, the Commission 
estimates that the total cost of the Rules and Form SDR for all 
respondents is approximately $29,905,416 annually and approximately 
$89,716,248 for all respondents over three years.
    An agency may not conduct or sponsor, and a person is not required 
to respond to, a collection of information under the PRA unless it 
displays a currently valid OMB control number.
