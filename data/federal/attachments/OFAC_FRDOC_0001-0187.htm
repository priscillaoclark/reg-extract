Background

    On March 6, 2003, the President, invoking the authority of, inter 
alia, the International Emergency Economic Powers Act (50 U.S.C. 1701-
06) (``IEEPA'') issued Executive Order 13288 (68 FR 11457, March 10, 
2003). In Executive Order 13288, the President declared a national 
emergency to deal with the threat posed by the actions and policies of 
certain members of the Government of Zimbabwe and other persons to 
undermine Zimbabwe's democratic processes or institutions, contributing 
to the deliberate breakdown in the rule of law in Zimbabwe, to 
politically motivated violence and intimidation in that country, and to 
political and economic instability in the southern African region. The 
Annex to Executive Order 13288 included 77 individuals, including two 
of the three individuals identified in this notice, which resulted in 
the blocking of all property and interests in property of these 
individuals that was or thereafter came within the United States or the 
possession or control of U.S. persons. Executive Order 13288 also 
authorized the Secretary of the Treasury, in consultation with the 
Secretary of State, to designate additional persons determined to meet 
the criteria set forth in Executive Order 13288.
    On November 22, 2005, in order to take additional steps with 
respect to the continued actions and policies of certain persons who 
undermine Zimbabwe's democratic processes and with respect to the 
national emergency described and declared in Executive Order 13288, the 
President, invoking the authority of, inter alia, IEEPA, issued 
Executive Order 13391 (70 FR 71201, November 25, 2005). Executive Order 
13391 amends Executive Order 13288 and provides that the Annex to 
Executive Order 13288 is replaced and superseded in its entirety by the 
Annex to Executive Order 13391, containing the names of 128 individuals 
and 33 entities, including the three individuals identified in this 
notice.
    Executive Order 13288, as amended by Executive Order 13391, 
authorizes the Secretary of the Treasury, in consultation with the 
Secretary of State, to block the property and interests in property of 
additional categories of persons beyond the category set forth in 
Executive Order 13288 prior to its amendment.
    Executive Order 13288, as amended by Executive Order 13991, also 
authorizes the Secretary of the Treasury, in consultation with the 
Secretary of State, to determine that circumstances no longer warrant 
the inclusion of a person in the Annex to Executive Order 13288, as 
replaced and superseded by the Annex to Executive Order 13991, and to 
unblock any property and interests in property that had been blocked as 
a result of the person's inclusion in the Annex.
    On December 14, 2010, the Director of OFAC, in consultation with 
the State Department, determined that circumstances no longer warrant 
the inclusion of the individuals listed below in the Annex to Executive 
Order 13288, as replaced and superseded by the Annex to Executive Order 
13391, and that the property and interests in property of the 
individuals listed below are therefore no longer blocked pursuant to 
section 1(a) of Executive Order 13288, as amended by Executive Order 
13391, and accordingly removed them from the SDN List.
