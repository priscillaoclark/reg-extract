FOR FURTHER INFORMATION CONTACT: To request additional information, 
please Donna Schneider. 202-565-3612.

SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION: This collection of information is necessary, 
pursuant to 12 U.S.C. 635(a)(1), to determine eligibility of the export 
sales for insurance coverage. The Report of Premiums Payable for 
Financial Institutions Only is used to determine the eligibility of the 
shipment(s) and to calculate the premium due to Ex-Im Bank for its 
support of the shipment(s) under its insurance program. Export-Import 
Bank customers will be able to submit this form on paper or 
electronically.
    By neutralizing the effect of export credit support offered by 
foreign governments and by absorbing credit risks that the private 
sector will not accept, EXIM enables U.S. exporters to compete fairly 
in foreign markets on the basis of price and product. Under the Working 
Capital Guarantee Program, EXIM provides repayment guarantees to 
lenders on secured, short-term working capital loans made to qualified 
exporters. The guarantee may be approved for a single loan or a 
revolving line of credit. In the event that a buyer defaults on a 
transaction insured by EXIM the insured exporter or lender may seek 
payment by the submission of a claim.
