I. Self-Regulatory Organization's Statement of the Terms of Substance 
of the Proposed Rule Change

    The Exchange is filing with the Commission a proposed rule change

II. Self-Regulatory Organization's Statement of the Purpose of, and 
Statutory Basis for, the Proposed Rule Change

    In its filing with the Commission, the Exchange included statements 
concerning the purpose of and basis for the proposed rule change and 
discussed any comments it received on the proposed rule change. The

sections A, B, and C below, of the most significant aspects of such 
statements.

[[Page 86383]]

A. Self-Regulatory Organization's Statement of the Purpose of, and 
Statutory Basis for, the Proposed Rule Change

1. Purpose
    The Exchange proposes to amend Rule 19.5, Interpretation and Policy 
.05 (Series of Options Contracts Open for Trading) to permit the 
expansion of Monday expirations in Exchange Traded Products (``ETPs''). 
Specifically, the Exchange proposes to expand the Short Term Option 
Series Program to permit the listing of two Monday expirations for 
options on SPDR Gold Shares (``GLD''), iShares Silver Trust (``SLV''), 
and iShares 20+ Year Treasury Bond ETF (``TLT'').\5\ This is a 
competitive filing that is based on a proposal submitted from Nasdaq 
ISE, LLC (``Nasdaq ISE'') and recently approved by the Commission.\6\
---------------------------------------------------------------------------

    \5\ Today, the Exchange permits the listing of two Wednesday 
expirations for options on GLD, SLV, and TLT. See Securities 
Exchange Act Release No. 99211 (December 20, 2023), 88 FR 89481 
(December 27, 2023) (SR-MEMX-2023-35).
    \6\ See Securities Exchange Act Release No. 100837 (August 27, 
2024) 89 FR 71770 (September 3, 2024) (Order approving SR-ISE-2024-
21).
---------------------------------------------------------------------------

    Currently, as set forth in in Exchange Rule 19.5, Interpretation 
and Policy .05, after an option class has been approved for listing and 
trading on the Exchange as a Short Term Option Series,\7\ the Exchange 
may open for trading on any Thursday or Friday that is a business day 
(``Short Term Option Opening Date'') series of options on that class 
that expire at the close of business on each of the next five Fridays 
that are business days and are not Fridays in which standard expiration 
options series, Monthly Options Series, or Quarterly Options Series 
expire (``Friday Short Term Option Expiration Dates''). The Exchange 
may have no more than a total of five Short Term Option Friday 
Expiration Dates (``Short Term Option Weekly Expirations''). Further, 
if the Exchange is not open for business on the respective Thursday or 
Friday, the Short Term Option Opening Date for Short Term Option Weekly 
Expirations will be the first business day immediately prior to that 
respective Thursday or Friday. Similarly, if the Exchange is not open 
for business on a Friday, the Short Term Option Expiration Date for 
Short Term Option Weekly Expirations will be the first business day 
immediately prior to that Friday.
---------------------------------------------------------------------------

    \7\ The term ``Short Term Option Series'' is a series in an 
option class that is approved for listing and trading on the 
Exchange in which the series is opened for trading on any Monday, 
Tuesday, Wednesday, Thursday or Friday that is a business day and 
that expires on the Monday, Tuesday, Wednesday, Thursday, or Friday 
of the next business week, or, in the case of a series that is 
listed on a Friday and expires on a Monday, is listed one business 
week and one business day prior to that expiration. If a Tuesday, 
Wednesday, Thursday or Friday is not a business day, the series may 
be opened (or shall expire) on the first business day immediately 
prior to that Tuesday, Wednesday, Thursday or Friday, respectively. 
For a series listed pursuant to this section for Monday expiration, 
if a Monday is not a business day, the series shall expire on the 
first business day immediately following that Monday. See Exchange 
Rule 16.1.
---------------------------------------------------------------------------

    Additionally, the Exchange may open for trading series of options 
on the symbols provided in Table 1 of Exchange Rule 19.5, 
Interpretation and Policy .05(h) that expire at the close of business 
on each of the next two Mondays, Tuesdays, Wednesdays, and Thursdays, 
respectively, that are business days beyond the current week and are 
not business days in which standard expiration options series, Monthly 
Options Series, or Quarterly Options Series expire (``Short Term Option 
Daily Expirations'').\8\ For those symbols listed in Table 1, the 
Exchange may have no more than a total of two Short Term Option Daily 
Expirations beyond the current week for each of Monday, Tuesday, 
Wednesday, and Thursday expirations, as applicable, at one time.
---------------------------------------------------------------------------

    \8\ As set forth in Table 1 in Rule 19.5, Interpretation and 
Policy .05(h), the Exchange currently only permits Wednesday 
expirations for USO, UNG, GLD, SLV and TLT.
---------------------------------------------------------------------------

    At this time, the Exchange proposes to expand the Short Term Option 
Daily Expirations to permit the listing and trading of options on GLD, 
SLV, and TLT expiring on Mondays. The Exchange proposes to permit two 
Short Term Option Expiration Dates beyond the current week for each 
Monday expiration at one time, and would update Table 1 in Exchange 
Rule 19.5, Interpretation and Policy .05(h) for each of those symbols 
accordingly.
    The proposed Monday GLD, SLV, and TLT expirations will be similar 
to the current Monday SPY, QQQ, and IWM Short Term Option Daily 
Expirations set forth in Exchange Rule 19.5, Interpretation and Policy 
.05(h) such that the Exchange may open for trading on any Friday or 
Monday that is a business day (beyond the current week) series of 
options on GLD, SLV, and TLT to expire on any Monday of the month that 
is a business day and is not a Monday in which standard expiration 
options series, Monthly Options Series, or Quarterly Options Series 
expire, provided that Monday expirations that are listed on a Friday 
must be listed at least one business week and one business day prior to 
the expiration (``Monday GLD Expirations,'' ``Monday SLV Expirations,'' 
and ``Monday TLT Expirations'') (collectively, ``Monday ETP 
Expirations'').\9\ In the event Short Term Option Daily Expirations 
expire on a Monday and that Monday is the same day that a standard 
expiration options series, Monthly Options Series, or Quarterly Options 
Series expires, the Exchange would skip that week's listing and instead 
list the following week; the two weeks would therefore not be 
consecutive. Today, Monday expirations in SPY, QQQ, and IWM similarly 
skip the weekly listing in the event the weekly listing expires on the 
same day in the same class as a standard expiration options series, 
Monthly Options Series, or Quarterly Options Series.
---------------------------------------------------------------------------

    \9\ Today, GLV, SLV and TLT may trade on Wednesdays. See supra 
note 5. They may also trade on Fridays, as is the case for all 
options series in the Short Term Option Series Program.
---------------------------------------------------------------------------

    The interval between strike prices for the proposed Monday ETP 
Expirations will be the same as those currently applicable to the Short 
Term Option Series Program.\10\ Specifically, the Monday ETP 
Expirations will have a strike interval of (i) $0.50 or greater for 
strike prices below $100, and $1 or greater for strike prices between 
$100 and $150 for all option classes that participate in the Short Term 
Option Series Program, (ii) $0.50 for option classes that trade in one 
dollar increments and are in the Short Term Option Series Program, or 
(iii) $2.50 or greater for strike prices above $150.\11\ As is the case 
with other equity options series listed pursuant to the Short Term 
Option Series Program, the Monday ETP Expirations series will be P.M.-
settled.
---------------------------------------------------------------------------

    \10\ See Rule 19.5, Interpretation and Policy .05(e).
    \11\ Id.
---------------------------------------------------------------------------

    Pursuant to the Exchange's definition of the Short Term Option 
Series Program, if a Monday is not a business day, the series shall 
expire on the first business day immediately following that Monday.\12\
---------------------------------------------------------------------------

    \12\ See supra note 7.
---------------------------------------------------------------------------

    Currently, for each option class eligible for participation in the 
Short Term Option Series Program, the Exchange is limited to opening 
thirty (30) series for each expiration date for the specific class.\13\ 
The thirty (30) series restriction does not include series that are 
open by other securities exchanges under their respective weekly rules; 
the Exchange may list these additional series that are listed by other 
options exchanges.\14\ With the proposed changes, this thirty (30) 
series restriction would apply to Monday GLD, SLV, and TLT Short Term 
Option Daily Expirations as well. In addition, the

[[Page 86384]]

Exchange will be able to list series that are listed by other 
exchanges, assuming they file similar rules with the Commission to list 
Monday ETP Expirations.
---------------------------------------------------------------------------

    \13\ See Rule 19.5, Interpretation and Policy .05(a).
    \14\ Id.
---------------------------------------------------------------------------

    With this proposal, Monday ETP Expirations would be treated 
similarly to existing Monday SPY, QQQ, and IWM Expirations. With 
respect to standard expiration option series, Short Term Option Daily 
Expirations will be permitted to expire in the same week in which 
standard expiration option series on the same class expire.\15\ Not 
listing Short Term Option Daily Expirations for one week every month 
because there was a standard options series on that same class on the 
Friday of that week would create investor confusion.
---------------------------------------------------------------------------

    \15\ See Rule 19.5, Interpretation and Policy .05(b).
---------------------------------------------------------------------------

    Further, as with Monday SPY, QQQ, and IWM Expirations, the Exchange 
would not permit Monday ETP Expirations to expire on a business day in 
which standard expiration option series, Monthly Options Series, or 
Quarterly Options Series expire.\16\ Therefore, all Short Term Option 
Daily Expirations would expire at the close of business on each of the 
next two Mondays, Tuesdays, Wednesdays, and Thursdays, respectively, 
that are business days and are not business days in which standard 
expiration option series, Monthly Options Series, or Quarterly Options 
Series expire. The Exchange believes that it is reasonable to not 
permit two expirations on the same day in which a standard expiration 
option series, Monthly Options Series, a Quarterly Options Series would 
expire because those options would be duplicative of each other.
---------------------------------------------------------------------------

    \16\ See Rule 19.5, Interpretation and Policy .05.
---------------------------------------------------------------------------

    The Exchange does not believe that any market disruptions will be 
encountered with the introduction of Monday ETP Expirations. The 
Exchange currently trades P.M.-settled Short Term Option Series that 
expire Monday for SPY, QQQ and IWM and has not experienced any market 
disruptions nor issues with capacity. In addition, the Exchange has not 
experienced any market disruptions or issues with capacity in expanding 
the three ETPs to the Wednesday expirations.\17\ Today, the Exchange 
has surveillance programs in place to support and properly monitor 
trading in Short Term Option Series that expire Monday for SPY, QQQ and 
IWM. Further, the Exchange has the necessary capacity and surveillance 
programs in place to support and properly monitor trading in the 
proposed Monday ETP Expirations.
---------------------------------------------------------------------------

    \17\ See supra note 5.
---------------------------------------------------------------------------

2. Statutory Basis
    The Exchange believes that the proposal is consistent with the 
requirements of Section 6(b) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 
(the ``Act''),\18\ in general, and Section 6(b)(5) of the Act,\19\ in 
particular, in that it is designed to prevent fraudulent and 
manipulative acts and practices, to promote just and equitable 
principles of trade, to foster cooperation and coordination with 
persons engaged in facilitating transactions in securities, to remove 
impediments to and perfect the mechanism of a free and open market and 
a national market system, and, in general to protect investors and the 
public interest.
---------------------------------------------------------------------------

    \18\ 15 U.S.C. 78f(b).
    \19\ 15 U.S.C. 78f(b)(5).
---------------------------------------------------------------------------

    Similar to Monday expirations in SPY, QQQ, and IWM, the proposal to 
permit Monday ETP Expirations, subject to the proposed limitation of 
two expirations beyond the current week, would protect investors and 
the public interest by providing the investing public and other market 
participants more choice and flexibility to closely tailor their 
investment and hedging decisions in these options and allow for a 
reduced premium cost of buying portfolio protection, thus allowing them 
to better manage their risk exposure.
    The Exchange represents that it has an adequate surveillance 
program in place to detect manipulative trading in the proposed option 
expirations, in the same way that it monitors trading in the current 
Short Term Option Series for Monday SPY, QQQ and IWM expirations. The 
Exchange also represents that it has the necessary system capacity to 
support the new expirations. Finally, the Exchange does not believe 
that any market disruptions will be encountered with the introduction 
of these option expirations. As discussed above, the Exchange believes 
that its proposal is a modest expansion of weekly expiration dates for 
GLD, SLV, and TLT given that it will be limited to two Monday 
expirations beyond the current week. Lastly, the Exchange believes that 
its proposal will not be a strain on liquidity providers because of the 
multi-class nature of GLD, SLV and TLT and the available hedges in 
highly correlated instruments.
    The Exchange believes that the proposal is consistent with the Act 
as the proposal would overall add a small number of Monday ETP 
Expirations by limiting the addition of two Monday expirations beyond 
the current week. The addition of Monday ETP Expirations would remove 
impediments to and perfect the mechanism of a free and open market by 
encouraging Market Makers to continue to deploy capital more 
efficiently and improve displayed market quality.\20\ The Exchange 
believes that the proposal will allow Participants to expand hedging 
tools and tailor their investment and hedging needs more effectively in 
GLD, SLV, and TLT as these funds are most likely to be utilized by 
market participants to hedge the underlying asset classes.
---------------------------------------------------------------------------

    \20\ Today, Market Makers are required to quote a specified time 
in their assigned options series. See Exchange Rule 22.5.
---------------------------------------------------------------------------

    Similar to Monday SPY, QQQ, and IWM expirations, the introduction 
of Monday ETP Expirations is consistent with the Act as it will, among 
other things, expand hedging tools available to market participants and 
allow for a reduced premium cost of buying portfolio protection. The 
Exchange believes that Monday ETP Expirations will allow market 
participants to purchase options on GLD, SLV, and TLT based on their 
timing as needed and allow them to tailor their investment and hedging 
needs more effectively, thus allowing them to better manage their risk 
exposure. Today, the Exchange lists Monday SPY, QQQ, and IWM 
Expirations.\21\
---------------------------------------------------------------------------

    \21\ See Rule 19.5, Interpretation and Policy .05.
---------------------------------------------------------------------------

    The Exchange believes the Short Term Option Series Program has been 
successful to date and that Monday ETP Expirations should simply expand 
the ability of investors to hedge risk against market movements 
stemming from economic releases or market events that occur throughout 
the month in the same way that the Short Term Option Series Program has 
expanded the landscape of hedging.
    There are no material differences in the treatment of Monday SPY, 
QQQ and IWM expirations compared to the proposed Monday ETP 
Expirations. Given the similarities between Monday SPY, QQQ and IWM 
expirations and the proposed Monday ETP Expirations, the Exchange 
believes that applying the provisions in Rule 19.5, Interpretation and 
Policy .05 that currently apply to Monday SPY, QQQ and IWM expirations 
is justified. For example, the Exchange believes that allowing Monday 
ETP Expirations and monthly Exchange Traded Product expirations in the 
same week will benefit investors and minimize investor confusion by 
providing Monday ETP Expirations in a continuous and uniform manner.

[[Page 86385]]

B. Self-Regulatory Organization's Statement on Burden on Competition

    The Exchange does not believe that the proposed rule change will 
impose any burden on competition not necessary or appropriate in 
furtherance of the purposes of the Act. In this regard and as indicated 
above, the Exchange notes that the rule change is being proposed as a 
competitive response to a filing submitted by Nasdaq ISE that was 
recently approved by the Commission.\22\
---------------------------------------------------------------------------

    \22\ See supra note 6.
---------------------------------------------------------------------------

    While the proposal will expand the Short Term Options Expirations 
to allow Monday ETP Expirations to be listed on the Exchange, the 
Exchange believes that this limited expansion for Monday expirations 
for options on GLD, SLV, and TLT will not impose an undue burden on 
competition; rather, it will meet customer demand. The Exchange 
believes that Participants will continue to be able to expand hedging 
tools and tailor their investment and hedging needs more effectively in 
GLD, SLV, and TLT.
    Similar to Monday SPY, QQQ and IWM expirations, the introduction of 
Monday ETP Expirations does not impose an undue burden on competition. 
The Exchange believes that it will, among other things, expand hedging 
tools available to market participants and allow for a reduced premium 
cost of buying portfolio protection. The Exchange believes that Monday 
ETP Expirations will allow market participants to purchase options on 
GLD, SLV, and TLT based on their timing as needed and allow them to 
tailor their investment and hedging needs more effectively.
    The Exchange does not believe the proposal will impose any burden 
on intermarket competition, as nothing prevents the other options 
exchanges from proposing similar rules to list and trade Monday ETP 
Expirations. Further, the Exchange does not believe the proposal will 
impose any burden on intra-market competition, as all market 
participants will be treated in the same manner under this proposal.

C. Self-Regulatory Organization's Statement on Comments on the Proposed 
Rule Change Received From Members, Participants, or Others

    The Exchange neither solicited nor received comments on the 
proposed rule change.

III. Date of Effectiveness of the Proposed Rule Change and Timing for 
Commission Action

    The Exchange has filed the proposed rule change pursuant to Section 
19(b)(3)(A)(iii) of the Act \23\ and Rule 19b-4(f)(6) thereunder.\24\ 
Because the foregoing proposed rule change does not: (i) significantly 
affect the protection of investors or the public interest; (ii) impose 
any significant burden on competition; and (iii) become operative for 
30 days from the date on which it was filed, or such shorter time as 
the Commission may designate, it has become effective pursuant to 
Section 19(b)(3)(A)(iii) of the Act \25\ and subparagraph (f)(6) of 
Rule 19b-4 thereunder.\26\
---------------------------------------------------------------------------

    \23\ 15 U.S.C. 78s(b)(3)(A)(iii).
    \24\ 17 CFR 240.19b-4(f)(6).
    \25\ 15 U.S.C. 78s(b)(3)(A)(iii).
    \26\ 17 CFR 240.19b-4(f)(6). In addition, Rule 19b-4(f)(6)(iii) 
requires a self-regulatory organization to give the Commission 
written notice of its intent to file the proposed rule change, along 
with a brief description and text of the proposed rule change, at 
least five business days prior to the date of filing of the proposed 
rule change, or such shorter time as designated by the Commission. 
The Exchange has satisfied this requirement.
---------------------------------------------------------------------------

    A proposed rule change filed pursuant to Rule 19b-4(f)(6) under the 
Act \27\ normally does not become operative for 30 days after the date 
of its filing. However, Rule 19b-4(f)(6)(iii) \28\ permits the 
Commission to designate a shorter time if such action is consistent 
with the protection of investors and the public interest. The Exchange 
has requested that the Commission waive the 30-day operative delay to 
permit the Exchange to implement the proposal at the same time as its 
competitors. The Exchange states that its proposal is substantively 
identical in all material respects to a proposal submitted by Nasdaq 
ISE that was recently approved by the Commission.\29\ The Commission 
believes that the proposed rule change presents no novel issues and 
that waiver of the 30-day operative delay is consistent with the 
protection of investors and the public interest. Accordingly, the 
Commission hereby waives the operative delay and designates the 
proposed rule change operative upon filing.\30\
---------------------------------------------------------------------------

    \27\ 17 CFR 240.19b-4(f)(6).
    \28\ 17 CFR 240.19b-4(f)(6)(iii).
    \29\ See supra note 6 and accompanying text.
    \30\ For purposes only of waiving the 30-day operative delay, 
the Commission has also considered the proposed rule's impact on 
efficiency, competition, and capital formation. See 15 U.S.C. 
78c(f).
---------------------------------------------------------------------------

    At any time within 60 days of the filing of the proposed rule 
change, the Commission summarily may temporarily suspend such rule 
change if it appears to the Commission that such action is necessary or 
appropriate in the public interest, for the protection of investors, or 
otherwise in furtherance of the purposes of the Act. If the Commission 
takes such action, the Commission shall institute proceedings to 
determine whether the proposed rule should be approved or disapproved.

IV. Solicitation of Comments

change is consistent with the Act. Comments may be submitted by any of
