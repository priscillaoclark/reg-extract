SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION: 

I. Background

    On May 4, 2023, FHFA published in the Federal Register a proposed 
rule to amend its regulation governing prudential management and 
operations standards, located at 12 CFR part 1236. See 88 FR 28433. The 
preamble discussion contains inadvertent typographical errors in 
reference to the regulation in sections II. and III.E. Sections II, and 
III.E. of the preamble discussions, therefore, should have referenced 
``the regulation'' instead of ``the proposed rule''. There are no 
corrections to the proposed amendments to the regulation text in 12 CFR 
1236 or to its appendix. For additional details on the proposed 
rulemaking, please see the May 4, 2023, Federal Register publication at 
88 FR 28433.

II. Correction of Errors in the Preamble

    In the proposed rule document FR Doc. 2023-09320 of May 4, 2023 (88 
FR 28433), the following corrections are made:
    1. On page 28433, in the right column, second full paragraph, lines 
1, 13-14, the phrase ``The proposed rule'' is corrected to read ``The 
regulation''.
    2. On page 28434, in the left column, in the first full paragraph, 
lines 1, 11, 14, 19-20, 24, the words ``proposed rule'' are corrected 
to read ``regulation''.
    3. On page 28434, in the left column, in the second full paragraph, 
line 1, the words ``proposed rule'' are corrected to read 
``regulation''.
    4. On page 28436, in the left column, second full paragraph, line 
18, the words ``proposed rule'' are corrected to read ``regulation''.
