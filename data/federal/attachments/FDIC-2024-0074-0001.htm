Source: FDIC.

    General Description of Collection: Upon the failure of an FDIC-
insured depository institution, the FDIC is required to pay insured 
deposits as soon as possible. To do so, the FDIC must be able to 
quickly determine the total insured amount for each depositor. To make 
this determination, the FDIC must ascertain the balances of all deposit 
accounts owned by the same depositor in the same ownership capacity at 
a failed institution as of the day of failure. The FDIC issued a 
regulation (12 CFR 360.9) to modernize the process of determining the 
insurance status of each depositor in the event of failure of a covered 
institution. The regulations enable operations of a large insured 
depository institution to continue functioning on the day following 
failure, support the FDIC's efforts to fulfill it's legal mandates 
regarding the resolution of failed insured deposit institutions, and 
apply to the largest institutions only ($2 billion in domestic deposits 
or more). More specifically, the regulations require the largest 
insured depository institutions to adopt mechanisms that would, in the 
event of the institution's failure (1) provide the FDIC with standard 
deposit account and customer informaton, and (2) allow the FDIC to 
place and release holds on liability accounts, including deposits. 
There is no change in the methodology or substance of this information 
collection. The decrease in total estimated annual burden from 6,464 
hours in 2021 to 5,948 hours currently is due to a decrease in 
estimated number or respondents.

     (Hours):.
----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

    General Description of Collection: The FDIC's deposit insurance 
assessment authority is set forth in section 7 of the Federal Deposit 
Insurance Act, 12 U.S.C. 1817(b) and (c), and promulgated in 
regulations under 12 CFR part 327. These regulations also set out the 
process for making adjustments to the total score of these institutions 
used by the FDIC in making deposit insurance assessments. Depository 
institutions are permitted to make a written request to the FDIC for an 
assessment adjustment. An institution is able to request review of, or 
appeal, an upward adjustment, the magnitude of an upward adjustment, 
removal of a previously implemented downward adjustment or an increase 
in a previously implemented upward adjustment through the FDIC's 
internal review process set forth at 12 CFR 327.4(c). An institution 
can similarly request review of or appeal a decision not to apply an 
adjustment following a request by the institution for an adjustment. An 
institution can submit its written request for an adjustment to the 
FDIC's Director of the Division of Insurance and Research in 
Washington, DC. In making such a request, the institution will provide 
support by including evidence of a material risk or risk mitigating 
factor that it believes was not adequately considered. There is no 
change in the methodology or substance of this information collection. 
The decrease in total estimated annual burden from 160 hours in 2021 to 
80 hours currently is due to a decrease in estimated number or 
respondents.

    General Description of Collection: This information collection 
comprises recordkeeping and disclosure requirements under regulations 
issued by the FDIC, jointly with the Office of the Comptroller of the 
Currency, the Board of Governors of the Federal Reserve System, the 
National Credit Union Administration, the Bureau of Consumer Financial 
Protection, and the Federal Home Finance Agency, that implement the 
minimum requirements in section 1473 of the Dodd-Frank Wall Street 
Reform and Consumer Protection Act (Dodd-Frank Act) to be applied by 
States in the registration and supervision of appraisal management 
companies (AMCs). The regulations also implement the requirement in 
section 1473 of the Dodd-Frank Act for States to report to the 
Appraisal Subcommittee of the Federal Financial Institutions 
Examination Council the information required by the ASC to administer 
the new national registry of appraisal management companies (AMC 
National Registry or Registry). The information collection requirements 
are established in 12 CFR part 323 of the FDIC's codified regulations. 
There is no change in the methodology or substance of this information 
collection. The decrease in total estimated annual burden from 2,457 in 
2021 to 1,991 currently is due to a change in the estimated number or 
respondents.

Request for Comment

    Comments are invited on (a) whether the collections of information 
are necessary for the proper performance of the FDIC's functions, 
including whether the information has practical utility; (b) the 
accuracy of the estimates of the burden of the information collections, 
including the validity of the methodology and assumptions used; (c) 
ways to enhance the quality, utility, and clarity of the information to 
be collected; and (d) ways to minimize the burden of the collections of 
information on respondents, including through the use of automated 
collection techniques or other forms of information technology. All 
comments will become a matter of public record.

Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation.
