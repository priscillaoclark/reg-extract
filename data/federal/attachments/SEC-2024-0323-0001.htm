SECURITIES AND EXCHANGE COMMISSION

[Release No. 34-99671]


Notice of Intention To Cancel Registration of Certain Municipal 
Securities Dealers Pursuant to Section 15B(c)(3) of the Securities 
Exchange Act of 1934

March 5, 2024.
    Notice is given that the Securities and Exchange Commission 
(``Commission'') intends to issue an order or orders, pursuant to 
Section 15B(c)(3) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 (``Act''), 
cancelling the registrations of the municipal securities dealers 
(hereinafter referred to as ``registrants'') whose names appear in the 
attached Appendix.
    Section 15B(c)(3) of the Act provides, in pertinent part, that if 
the Commission finds that any municipal securities dealer registered 
under Section 15B is no longer in existence or has ceased to do 
business as a municipal securities dealer, the Commission, by order, 
shall cancel the registration of such municipal securities dealer.
    The Commission finds that each registrant listed in the attached 
Appendix has not filed any municipal securities dealer form submissions 
with the Commission through the Commission's Electronic Data Gathering 
and Retrieval (``EDGAR'') system since November 2016. Accordingly, the 
Commission finds that each registrant listed in the attached Appendix 
either is no longer in existence or has ceased to do business as a 
municipal securities dealer.
    Notice is also given that any interested person may, by April 1, 
2024, at 5:30 p.m. eastern time, submit to the Commission in writing a 
request for a hearing on the cancellation of the registration of any 
registrant listed in the attached Appendix, accompanied by a statement 
as to the nature of such person's interest, the reason for such

request, and the issues, if any, of fact or law proposed to be 
controverted, and such person may request to be notified if the 
Commission should order a hearing thereon. Any such communication 
should be addressed to the Commission's Secretary at <a href="/cdn-cgi/l/email-protection#ffac9a9c8d9a8b9e8d868cd2b09999969c9abf8c9a9cd1989089"><span class="__cf_email__" data-cfemail="eebd8b8d9c8b9a8f9c979dc3a18888878d8bae9d8b8dc0898198">[email&#160;protected]</span></a> with the phrase ``Notice of Intention to Cancel 
Municipal Securities Dealer Registration'' in the subject line.
    At any time after April 1, 2024, the Commission may issue an order 
or orders cancelling the registrations of any or all of the registrants 
listed in the attached Appendix, upon the basis of the information 
stated above, unless an order or orders for a hearing on the 
cancellation shall be issued upon request or upon the Commission's own 
motion. Persons who requested a hearing, or to be advised as to whether 
a hearing is ordered, will receive any notices and orders issued in 
this matter, including the date of the hearing (if ordered) and any 
postponements thereof. Any registrant whose registration is cancelled 
under delegated authority may appeal that decision directly to the 
Commission in accordance with Rules 430 and 431 of the Commission's 
rules of practice (17 CFR 201.430 and 431).
