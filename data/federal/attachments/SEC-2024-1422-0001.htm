SECURITIES EXCHANGE ACT OF 1934

[Release No. 34-101207]


Order Cancelling Registration of Municipal Advisor, Development & 
Public Finance, LLC, Pursuant to Section 15b(C)(3) of the Securities 
Exchange Act of 1934

September 27, 2024.
    Development & Public Finance, LLC (CIK No. 1613281, SEC File No. 
866-00124-00), hereinafter referred to as the ``registrant,'' is 
registered with the Securities and Exchange Commission (the 
``Commission'') as a municipal advisor pursuant to Sections 
15B(a)(1)(B) and 15B(a)(2) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 (the 
``Act'').
    On August 29, 2024, a Notice of Intention to Cancel Registration of 
Certain Municipal Advisors, including the registrant, was published in 
the Federal Register (Securities Exchange Act Release No. 34-100815). 
The notice gave interested persons an opportunity to request a hearing 
and stated that an order or orders cancelling the registration would be 
issued unless a hearing was ordered. No request for a hearing has been 
filed by any persons (including registrant), and the Commission has not 
ordered a hearing.
    Pursuant to Section 15B(c)(3) of the Act, the Commission has found 
that registrant is no longer in existence or has ceased to do business 
as a municipal advisor.
    Accordingly,
    It is ordered, pursuant to Section 15B(c)(3) of the Act, that the 
registration of Development & Public Finance, LLC (CIK No. 1613281, SEC 
File No. 866-00124-00) be, and hereby is, cancelled.

    For the Commission, by the Office of Municipal Securities, 
pursuant to delegated authority.\1\
