SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION: Proposal to renew the following currently 
approved collections of information:
    1. Title: Application for Waiver of Publication on Acceptance of 
Brokered Deposits for Adequately Capitalized Insured Institutions.
    OMB Number: 3064-0099.
    Frequency of Response: On occasion.
    Affected Public: Any insured depository institution seeking a 
waiver to the prohibition on the acceptance of brokered deposits.
    Estimated Number of Respondents: 30.

[[Page 75675]]

    Estimated Time per Response: 6 hours.
    Total Annual Burden: 180 hours.
    General Description of Collection: Section 29 of the FDI Act 
prohibits undercapitalized insured depository institutions from 
accepting, renewing, or rolling over any brokered deposits. Adequately 
capitalized institutions may do so with a waiver from the FDIC, while 
well-capitalized institutions may accept, renew, or roll over brokered 
deposits without restriction.
    2. Title: Management Official Interlocks.
    OMB Number: 3064-0118.
    Frequency of Response: On occasion.
    Affected Public: Insured State nonmember banks.
    Estimated Number of Respondents: 7.
    Estimated Time per Response: 4 hours.
    Total Annual Burden: 28 hours.
    General Description of Collection: This collection is associated 
with the FDIC's Management Official Interlocks regulation, 12 CFR Part 
348, which implements the Depository Institution Management Interlocks 
Act (DIMIA). DIMIA generally prohibits bank management officials from 
serving simultaneously with two unaffiliated depository institutions or 
their holding companies but allows the FDIC to grant exemptions on 
request in appropriate circumstances.
    3. Title: Foreign Branching and Investment by Insured State 
Nonmember Banks.
    OMB Number: 3064-0125.
    Frequency of Response: On occasion.
    Affected Public: Insured state nonmember banks.
    Estimated Number of Respondents: Recordkeeping: 50; reporting: 11.
    Estimated Time per Response: Recordkeeping: 400 hours; reporting: 
27 hours.
    Total Annual Burden: 20,298 hours.
    General Description of Collection: The Federal Deposit Insurance 
(FDI) Act requires state nonmember banks to obtain FDIC consent to 
establish or operate a branch in a foreign country, or to acquire and 
hold, directly or indirectly, stock or other evidence of ownership in 
any foreign bank or other entity. The FDI Act also authorizes the FDIC 
to impose conditions for such consent and to issue regulations related 
thereto. This collection is a direct consequence of those statutory 
requirements.
    4. Title: Affiliate Marketing Disclosures/Consumer Opt-Out Notices.
    OMB Number: 3064-0149.
    Frequency of Response: On occasion.
    Affected Public: Insured state nonmember banks.
    Number of Respondents: 978 financial institutions and 198,450 
consumers.
    Estimated Time per Response: 18 hours: prepare and distribute 
notice to consumers and employee training; 5 minutes: consumer response 
to opt-out notice.
    Total Estimated Annual Burden: 34,142 hours.
    General Description of Collection: Section 624 of the Fair Credit 
Reporting Act generally provides that, if a person shares certain 
information about a consumer with an affiliate, the affiliate may not 
use that information to make or send solicitations to the consumer 
about its products or services, unless the consumer is given notice and 
a reasonable opportunity to opt-out of such use of the information and 
the consumer does not opt-out. The information collections for which 
the Agencies seek OMB approval are (1) Notices to consumers of the 
opportunity to opt-out of solicitations from affiliates, and (2) 
consumer responses to the opt-out notices.
    Request for Comment:
    Comments are invited on: (a) Whether the collection of information 
is necessary for the proper performance of the FDIC's functions, 
including whether the information has practical utility; (b) the 
accuracy of the estimates of the burden of the information collection, 
including the validity of the methodology and assumptions used; (c) 
ways to enhance the quality, utility, and clarity of the information to 
be collected; and (d) ways to minimize the burden of the information 
collection on respondents, including through the use of automated 
collection techniques or other forms of information technology. All 
comments will become a matter of public record.

    Dated at Washington, DC, this 1st day of December 2010.

Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation.

Robert E. Feldman,
Executive Secretary.
