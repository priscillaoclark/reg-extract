SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION: Under the PRA, 44 U.S.C. 3501 et seq., 
Federal agencies must obtain approval from the Office of Management and 
Budget (``OMB'') for each collection of information they conduct or 
sponsor. ``Collection of Information'' is defined in 44 U.S.C. 3502(3) 
and 5 CFR 1320.3 and includes agency requests or requirements that 
members of the public submit reports, keep records, or provide 
information to a third party. Section 3506(c)(2)(A) of the PRA, 44 
U.S.C. 3506(c)(2)(A), requires Federal agencies to provide a 60-day 
notice in the Federal Register concerning each proposed collection of 
information, including each proposed extension of an existing 
collection of information, before submitting the collection to OMB for 
approval. To comply with this requirement, the CFTC is publishing 
notice of the proposed collection of information listed below. An 
agency may not conduct or sponsor, and a person is not required to 
respond to, a collection of information unless it displays a currently 
valid OMB control number.
    Title: Privacy of Consumer Financial Information (OMB Control No. 
3038-0055). This is a request for an extension of a currently approved 
information collection.
    Abstract: Section 124 of the Commodity Futures Modernization Act of 
2000 \1\ amended the Commodity Exchange Act (the Act) and added a new 
Section 5g \2\ to the Act to (i) provide that futures commission 
merchants, commodity trading advisors, commodity pool operators, and 
introducing brokers that are subject to CFTC jurisdiction with respect 
to any financial activity shall be treated as a financial institution 
for purposes of Title V, Subtitle A of the Gramm-Leach-Bliley Act 
(``GLB Act''), (ii) treat the Commission as a Federal functional 
regulator for purposes of applying the provisions of the GLB Act, and 
(iii) direct the Commission to prescribe regulations under Title V of 
the GLB Act. The Commission adopted regulations for these entities 
under part 160 and later extended them to retail foreign exchange 
dealers, swap dealers, and major swap participants.\3\ Part 160 
requires those subject to the regulations, among other things, to 
provide privacy and opt out notices to customers and to adopt 
appropriate policies and procedures to safeguard customer records and 
information. In April 2019, the Commission adopted amendments to its 
regulations to provide an exception to its annual privacy notice 
requirement under certain conditions.\4\

    With respect to the collection of information, the CFTC invites 
comments on:
    <bullet> Whether the proposed collection of information is 
necessary for the proper performance of the functions of the 
Commission, including whether the information will have a practical 
use;
    <bullet> The accuracy of the Commission's estimate of the burden of 
the proposed collection of information, including the validity of the 
methodology and assumptions used;
    <bullet> Ways to enhance the quality, usefulness, and clarity of 
the information to be collected; and
    <bullet> Ways to minimize the burden of collection of information
