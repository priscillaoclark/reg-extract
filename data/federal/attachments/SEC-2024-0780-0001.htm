Proposed Rule Change, as Modified by Amendment No. 1, to Amend Section 
802.01D of the NYSE Listed Company Manual Concerning the Suspension and 
Delisting of a Listed Company that has Changed its Primary Business 
Focus

June 6, 2024.
    On April 4, 2024, New York Stock Exchange LLC (``NYSE'' or the 
``Exchange'') filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission 
(``Commission''), pursuant to Section 19(b)(1) of the Securities 
Exchange Act of 1934 (``Act''),\1\ and Rule 19b-4 thereunder,\2\ a 
proposed rule change to permit the Exchange to commence suspension and 
delisting proceedings, under certain circumstances, with respect to a 
listed company that has changed its primary business focus to a new 
area of business that it was not engaged in at the time of its original 
listing or which was immaterial to its operations at the time of 
original listing. On April 17, 2024, the Exchange filed Amendment No. 1 
to the proposed rule change, which replaced and superseded the proposed 
rule change as originally filed. The proposed rule change, as modified 
by Amendment No. 1, was published for comment in the Federal Register 
on April 25, 2024.\3\ The Commission received no comments on the 
proposed rule change, as modified by Amendment No. 1.

    Section 19(b)(2) of the Act \4\ provides that within 45 days of the 
publication of notice of the filing of a proposed rule change, or 
within such longer period up to 90 days as the Commission may designate 
if it finds such longer period to be appropriate and publishes its 
reasons for so finding or as to which the self-regulatory organization 
consents, the Commission shall either approve the proposed rule change, 
disapprove the proposed rule change, or institute proceedings to 
determine whether the proposed rule change should be disapproved. The 
45th day after publication of the notice for this proposed rule change 
is June 9, 2024. The Commission is extending this 45-day time period.

sufficient time to consider the proposed rule change. Accordingly, the 
Commission, pursuant to Section 19(b)(2) of the Act,\5\ designates July 
24, 2024, as the date by which the Commission shall either approve or 
disapprove, or institute proceedings to determine whether to 
disapprove, the proposed rule change (File No. SR-NYSE-2024-21).
