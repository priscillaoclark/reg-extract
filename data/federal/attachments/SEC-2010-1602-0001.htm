SECURITIES AND EXCHANGE COMMISSION

 
Proposed Collection; Comment Request

Upon Written Request, Copies Available From: Securities and Exchange 
Commission, Office of Investor Education and Advocacy, Washington, DC 
20549-0213.

Extension:
    Rule 425, OMB Control No. 3235-0521, SEC File No. 270-462.

    Notice is hereby given, that pursuant to the Paperwork Reduction 
Act of 1995 (44 U.S.C. 3501 et seq.), the Securities and Exchange 
Commission (``Commission'') is soliciting comments on the collection of 
information summarized below. The Commission plans to submit this 
existing collection of information to the Office of Management and 
Budget for approval.
    Rule 425 (17 CFR 230.425) under the Securities Act of 1933 (15 
U.S.C. 77a et seq.) requires the filing of certain prospectuses and 
communications under Rule 135 (17 CFR 230.135) and Rule 165 (17 CFR 
230.165) in connection with business combination transactions. The 
purpose of the rule is to permit more oral and written communications 
with shareholders about tender offers, mergers and other business 
combination transactions on a more timely basis, so long as the written 
communications are filed on the date of first use. Approximately 1,680 
issuers file communications under Rule 425 at an estimated 0.25 hours 
per response for a total of 420 annual burden hours.
    Written comments are invited on: (a) Whether the collection of 
information is necessary for the proper performance of the functions of 
the agency, including whether the information will have practical 
utility; (b) the accuracy of the agency's estimate of the burden 
imposed by the collection of information; (c) ways to enhance the 
quality, utility, and clarity of the information collected; and (d) 
ways to minimize the burden of the collection of information on 
respondents, including through the use of automated collection 
techniques or other forms of information technology. Consideration will 
be given to comments and suggestions submitted in writing within 60 
days of this publication.
    Please direct your written comments to Jeffrey Heslop, Acting 
Director/CIO, Securities and Exchange Commission, C/O Remi Pavlik-
Simon, 6432 General Green Way, Alexandria, VA 22312; or send an e-mail 
to: <A HREF="mailto:PRA_Mailbox@sec.gov">PRA_Mailbox@sec.gov</A>.

    Dated: October 6, 2010.
Florence E. Harmon,
Deputy Secretary.
