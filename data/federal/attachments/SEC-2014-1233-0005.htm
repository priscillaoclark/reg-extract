SECURITIES AND EXCHANGE COMMISSION

[SEC File No. 270-185, OMB Control No. 3235-0238]


Submission for OMB Review; Comment Request; Extension: Form N-6F

Upon Written Request, Copies Available From: Securities and Exchange 
Commission, Office of FOIA Services, 100 F Street NE, Washington, DC 
20549-2736

    Notice is hereby given that, pursuant to the Paperwork Reduction 
Act of 1995 (44 U.S.C. 3501 et seq.), the Securities and Exchange 
Commission (``Commission'') has submitted to the Office of Management 
and Budget a request for extension of the previously

approved collection of information discussed below.
    The title for the collection of information is ``Form N-6F (17 CFR 
274.15), Notice of Intent to Elect to be Subject to Sections 55 through 
65 of the Investment Company Act of 1940.'' The purpose of Form N-6F is 
to notify the Commission of a company's intent to file a notification 
of election to become subject to Sections 55 through 65 of the 
Investment Company Act of 1940 (15 U.S.C. 80a-1 et seq.) (``1940 
Act''). Certain companies may have to make a filing with the Commission 
before they are ready to elect to be regulated as a business 
development company.\1\ A company that is excluded from the definition 
of ``investment company'' by Section 3(c)(1) because it has fewer than 
one hundred shareholders and is not making a public offering of its 
securities may lose such an exclusion solely because it proposes to 
make a public offering of securities as a business development company. 
Such company, under certain conditions, would not lose its exclusion if 
it notifies the Commission on Form N-6F of its intent to make an 
election to be regulated as a business development company. The company 
only has to file a Form N-6F once.
---------------------------------------------------------------------------

    \1\ A company might not be prepared to elect to be subject to 
Sections 55 through 65 of the 1940 Act because its capital structure 
or management compensation plan is not yet in compliance with the 
requirements of those sections.
---------------------------------------------------------------------------

    The Commission estimates that on average approximately 9 companies 
file these notifications each year. Each of those companies need only 
make a single filing of Form N-6F. The Commission further estimates 
that this information collection imposes burden of 0.5 hours, resulting 
in a total annual PRA burden of 4.5 hours. Based on the estimated wage 
rate, the total cost to the industry of the hour burden for complying 
with Form N-6F would be approximately $1,912.50.
    The collection of information under Form N-6F is mandatory. The 
information provided under the form is not kept confidential. An agency 
may not conduct or sponsor, and a person is not required to respond to, 
a collection of information unless it displays a currently valid OMB 
control number.
    The public may view background documentation for this information 
collection at the following website: <a href="http://www.reginfo.gov">www.reginfo.gov</a>. Find this 
particular information collection by selecting ``Currently under 30-day 
Review--Open for Public Comments'' or by using the search function. 
Written comments and recommendations for the proposed information 
collection should be sent within 30 days of publication of this notice 
by February 21, 2024 to (i) <a href="/cdn-cgi/l/email-protection#f9b4bba1d7b6b4bbd7b6b0abb8d7aabcbaa69d9c8a92a6969f9f909a9c8bb996949bd79c9689d79e968f"><span class="__cf_email__" data-cfemail="b1fcf3e99ffefcf39ffef8e3f09fe2f4f2eed5d4c2daeeded7d7d8d2d4c3f1dedcd39fd4dec19fd6dec7">[email&#160;protected]</span></a>

and Exchange Commission, c/o John Pezzullo, 100 F Street NE, 
Washington, DC 20549, or by sending an email to: <a href="/cdn-cgi/l/email-protection#732321322c3e121a1f111c0b330016105d141c05"><span class="__cf_email__" data-cfemail="fbaba9baa4b69a9297999483bb889e98d59c948d">[email&#160;protected]</span></a>.
