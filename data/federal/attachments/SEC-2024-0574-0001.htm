    \5\ See Securities Exchange Act Release No. 99082, 88 FR 85962

date of publication of notice of filing of the proposed rule change.

and publishes the reasons for such determination. The proposed rule 
change was published for comment in the Federal Register on October 27, 
2023.\10\ The 180th day after publication of the proposed rule change 
is April 24, 2024. The Commission is extending the time period for

    The Commission finds that it is appropriate to designate a longer 
period within which to issue an order approving or disapproving the 
proposed rule change so that it has sufficient time to consider the 
proposed rule change, as modified by Amendment No. 1, and the issues 
raised therein. Accordingly, the Commission, pursuant to section 
19(b)(2) of the Act,\11\ designates June 23, 2024, as the date by which 
the Commission shall either approve or disapprove the proposed rule 
change, as modified by Amendment No. 1 (File No. SR-NYSEArca-2023-70).
