    \1\ More specifically, sections 635(a)(1) and 635a(j)(1)(C) of 
the Export-Import Bank Act of 1945, as amended.
---------------------------------------------------------------------------

PURPOSE(S) OF THE SYSTEM:
    The purpose of this system of records is to facilitate and enable 
EXIM to communicate with its employees and contractors (``Contacts'') 
in a quick and efficient manner in critical events. EXIM utilizes EXIM 
Emergency Notification System to ensure employee safety and business 
continuity, as well as swift disaster recovery during critical events. 
EXIM uses contact information of its employees and contractors 
(typically name, telephone number, email addresses and/or physical 
address, which is stored within OnSolve Platform for Critical Event 
Management (PCEM)) and use the system to communicate alerts using 
multiple modalities (including SMS, email, and voice collectively 
referred to herein as ``alerts'') to the Contacts at scale.

CATEGORIES OF INDIVIDUALS COVERED BY THE SYSTEM:
    The EXIM Emergency Notification System will contain information on 
EXIM current employees and contractors.

CATEGORIES OF RECORDS IN THE SYSTEM:
    The EXIM Emergency Notification System will contain Personally 
Identifiable Information (PII) of EXIM current employees and 
contractors typically including, but not limited to name, telephone 
number, email addresses and/or physical address/location, and travel 
data such as dates and locations of travel captured through manual 
entry or an API (Application Programming Interface) from EXIM Travel 
Reservation Management system (Concur). This information will be 
necessary to enable EXIM to identify and communicate with EXIM staff 
and other persons having connections with EXIM (``Contacts'' or 
``Recipients'') in a quick and efficient manner to ensure employee 
safety and business continuity, as well as swift recovery during 
critical events.

RECORD SOURCE CATEGORIES:
    The information in the system is obtained using one of three 
methods: (1) Active Directory (AD) user data will be used as the 
initial source of information for the database to create users, (2) 
additional user information will be entered by the user via the user 
account ``opt-in'' portal, and (3) data captured through manual entry 
or an API (Application Programming Interface) from EXIM Travel 
Reservation Management system (Concur). User accounts are created 
individually within the OnSolve portal or uploaded via SFTP from an 
Active Directory export using System Center Orchestrator (SCOrch).

ROUTINE USES OF RECORDS MAINTAINED IN THE SYSTEM, INCLUDING CATEGORIES 
OF USERS AND PURPOSES OF SUCH USES:
    In addition to those disclosures that are generally permitted under 
5 U.S.C. 552a(b) of the Privacy Act, all or a

[[Page 14489]]

portion of the records or information contained in this system may be 
disclosed to authorized entities, as is determined to be relevant and 
necessary, outside EXIM as a routine use pursuant to 5 U.S.C. 
552a(b)(3) as follows:
    1. Appropriate agencies, entities, and persons when (a) the Bank 
suspects or has confirmed that there has been a breach of the system of 
records; (b) the Bank has determined that as a result of the suspected 
or confirmed breach there is a risk of harm to individuals, the Bank 
(including its information systems, programs, and operations), the 
Federal Government, or national security; and (c) the disclosure made 
to such agencies, entities, and persons is reasonably necessary to 
assist in connection with the Bank's efforts to respond to the 
suspected or confirmed breach or to prevent, minimize, or remedy such 
harm.
    2. Another Federal agency or Federal entity, when the Bank 
determines that information from this system of records is reasonably 
necessary to assist the recipient agency or entity in (a) responding to 
a suspected or confirmed breach or (b) preventing, minimizing, or

entity (including its information systems, programs, and operations), 
the Federal Government, or national security, resulting from a 
suspected or confirmed breach.
    3. Congressional offices in response to an inquiry made at the 
request of the individual to whom the record pertains.
    4. Contractors or other authorized individuals performing work on a 
contract, service, cooperative agreement, job, or other activity on 
behalf of the Bank or Federal Government and who have a need to access 
the information in the performance of their duties or activities.
    5. The U.S. Department of Justice (DOJ) for its use in providing 
legal advice to the Bank or in representing the Bank in a proceeding 
before a court, adjudicative body, or other administrative body, where 
the use of such information by the DOJ is deemed by the Bank to be 
relevant and necessary to the advice or proceeding, and in the case of 
a proceeding, such proceeding names as a party in interest: (a) The 
Bank; (b) Any employee of the Bank in his or her official capacity; (c) 
Any employee of the Bank in his or her individual capacity where DOJ 
has agreed to represent the employee; or (d) The United States, where 
the Bank determines that litigation is likely to affect the Bank or any 
of its components.
    6. A court, magistrate, or administrative tribunal during an 
administrative proceeding or judicial proceeding, including disclosures 
to opposing counsel or witnesses (including expert witnesses) during 
discovery or other pre-hearing exchanges of information, litigation, or 
settlement negotiations, where relevant and necessary to a proceeding, 
or in connection with criminal law proceedings.
    7. Appropriate Federal, State, local, foreign, Tribal, or self-
regulatory organizations or agencies responsible for investigating, 
prosecuting, enforcing, implementing, issuing, or carrying out a 
statute, rule, regulation, order, policy, or license if the record 
indicates a violation or a potential violation of civil or criminal 
law, rule, regulation, order, policy, or license.

POLICIES AND PRACTICES FOR STORAGE OF RECORDS:
    The records are stored digitally in encrypted format in the OnSolve 
PCEM Amazon Web Services (AWS) FedRAMP authorized cloud environment. 
OnSolve PCEM encrypts EXIM's sensitive information (such as current 
employee or contractor first name, last name, and email address) at 
rest and stores it in the databases leveraging native AWS encryption 
including Database (DB) clusters, snapshots, underlying structure for 
DB clusters. Automated database backups are in place along with read 
replica. Native AWS encryption on storage level with an encrypted 
Elastic Block Storage (EBS) volume using Advanced Encryption Standard 
(AES)--256). For live data (not in a backup file) Elastic File System 
(EFS) is used. EXIM Emergency Notification System complies with EXIM 
policy which stipulates that sensitive data (such as routine reports) 
generated from EXIM Emergency Notification System must be stored on 
EXIM's storage system that is managed and protected by EXIM's 
Infrastructure General Support System administrative, technical, and 
physical controls.

POLICIES AND PRACTICES FOR RETRIEVAL OF RECORDS:
    Records may be retrieved by the system administrator using 
Contact's (EXIM employee and contractor) first name, last name, work 
email address, as well as non-key attributes such as location (e.g., 
Headquarters or Regional Offices), to identify lists of potentially 
impacted contacts with a nexus to a critical event. Information may 
additionally be retrieved by other personal identifiers by user account 
maintenance programs within the application. The administrator runs 
routine reports and reviews analytics that include user unique 
identifiers such as name and phone number, etc. Reports can be filtered 
using a personal identifier (i.e., reports can be generated to indicate 
who responded to a notification message).

POLICIES AND PRACTICES FOR RETENTION AND DISPOSAL OF RECORDS:
    Records are archived/disposed of during the routine data sync for 
individuals who are no longer employees or contractors of EXIM. 
Otherwise, records are maintained and destroyed in accordance with the 
National Archives and Record Administration's (``NARA'') Basic Laws and 
Authorities (44 U.S.C. 3301, et seq.) or an EXIM Bank records 
disposition schedule approved by NARA.

ADMINISTRATIVE, TECHNICAL, AND PHYSICAL SAFEGUARDS:
    Information will be stored in electronic format within the OnSolve 
PCEM Cloud Service Provider (CSP) Amazon Web Service (AWS). EXIM 
Emergency Notification System has configurable, layered user accounts 
and permissions features to ensure users have only the amount of access 
necessary to perform their duties. Access to EXIM Emergency 
Notification System is restricted to EXIM current employees and 
contractors for emergency notification, information technology 
alerting, and disaster recovery to support effective communication. 
OnSolve PCEM users use HTTPS through CloudFlare DNS to access the 
application using an internet Browser. EXIM AD Data daily sync is 
performed using SFTP one direction initiated from EXIM only.
    OnSolve PCEM personnel access the AWS US East/West OnSolve Platform 
CEM environment via VPN to meet FIPS 140-2 Cryptographic Module 
Validation Program requirements at <a href="https://csrc.nist.gov/projects/cryptographic-module-validation-program">https://csrc.nist.gov/projects/cryptographic-module-validation-program</a>. Multi-factor authentication is 
implemented on personal mobile devices (only) for CSP administrators to 
authenticate. VPN Authentication occurs at the VPN located in the 
public subnet in the authorization boundary. After establishing the VPN 
connection, the administrator establishes an SSH connection to remote 
desktop into a Jump Host, within the Jump Host subnet. Personnel must 
supply their username and password provided by a dedicated Active 
Directory, specifically used for this AWS environment (i.e., not the 
corporate Active Directory). If someone were to leave the organization

[[Page 14490]]

or no longer require access, that individual's jump host can be 
deleted. Jump Hosts authenticate against Vault (within a management 
services subnet in the OnSolve AWS cloud environment) to establish 
access. Vault checks Active Directory to validate the login information 
that has been provided by the user and returns an SSH-signed 
certificate token/key that expires after 12 hours. Vault also stores 
``secrets'' to the environment. For example, all the database passwords 
for database users are stored in Vault. The Jump Host is allowed access 
into all other subnets for administrative purposes just as if the 12-
hours token has not expired.
    OnSolve PCEM, which is hosted in AWS as a Software-as-a-Service 
application, inherits all the administrative, technical, and physical 
controls offered by AWS and the EXIM Infrastructure General Support 
System.
    OnSolve PCEM CSP is compliant with the Federal Risk and 
Authorization Management Program (FedRAMP). The PII information EXIM 
Emergency Notification System is encrypted and stored in AWS, and the 
Hypertext Transfer Protocol Secure (HTTPS) protocol and Security 
Assertion Markup Language (SAML) authentication is used to access EXIM 
Emergency Notification System.
