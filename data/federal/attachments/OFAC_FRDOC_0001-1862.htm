Background

    On February 10, 2021, the President, invoking the authority of, 
inter alia, the International Emergency Economic Powers Act (50 U.S.C. 
1701 et seq.), issued Executive Order (E.O.) 14014 (86 FR 9429, 
February 12, 2021).
    In E.O. 14014, the President found the situation in and in relation 
to Burma, and in particular the February 1, 2021, coup, in which the 
military overthrew the democratically elected civilian government of 
Burma and unjustly arrested and detained government leaders, 
politicians, human rights defenders, journalists, and religious 
leaders, thereby rejecting the will of the people of Burma as expressed 
in elections held in November 2020 and undermining the country's 
democratic transition and rule of law, constitutes an unusual and 
extraordinary threat to the national security and foreign policy of the 
United States and declared a national emergency to deal with that 
threat.
    Section 1 of E.O. 14014 blocks all property and interests in 
property that are in the United States, that hereafter come within the 
United States, or that are or hereafter come within the possession or 
control of any United States person of any foreign person determined by 
the Secretary of the Treasury, in consultation with the Secretary of 
State, to, among other things, be a political subdivision, agency, or 
instrumentality of the Government of Burma.
    On October 31, 2023, OFAC issued Directive 1 under E.O. 14014, 
``Prohibitions Related to Financial Services to or for the Benefit of 
Myanma Oil and Gas Enterprise.'' In Directive 1, the Director of OFAC, 
in consultation with the Department of State, determined that the 
Myanma Oil and Gas Enterprise (MOGE) is a political subdivision, 
agency, or instrumentality of the Government of Burma, and that the 
following activities by a U.S. person are prohibited on or after 
December 15, 2023, except to the extent provided by law, or unless 
licensed or otherwise authorized by OFAC: The provision, exportation, 
or reexportation, directly or indirectly, of financial services to or 
for the benefit of MOGE or its property or interests in property.
    The text of Directive 1 under E.O. 14014 is provided below.

Control (OFAC) has determined, in consultation with the Department 
of State that the Myanma Oil and Gas Enterprise (MOGE) is a

of Burma, and that the following activities by a U.S. person are 
prohibited on or after December 15, 2023 except to the extent 
provided by law, or unless licensed or otherwise authorized by OFAC:

indirectly, of financial services to or for the benefit of MOGE or 
its property or interests in property.
