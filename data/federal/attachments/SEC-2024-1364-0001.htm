I. Self-Regulatory Organization's Statement of the Terms of Substance 
of the Proposed Rule Change

    The Exchange proposes to amend Rule 7.31 regarding the Minimum 
Trade Size Modifier. The proposed rule change is available on the 
Exchange's website at <a href="http://www.nyse.com">www.nyse.com</a>, at the principal office of the 
Exchange, and at the Commission's Public Reference Room.

II. Self-Regulatory Organization's Statement of the Purpose of, and 
Statutory Basis for, the Proposed Rule Change

    In its filing with the Commission, the self-regulatory organization 
included statements concerning the purpose of, and basis for, the 
proposed rule change and discussed any comments it received on the 
proposed rule change. The text of those statements may be examined at 
the places specified in Item IV below. The Exchange has prepared 
summaries, set forth in sections A, B, and C below, of the most 
significant parts of such statements.

[[Page 78407]]

A. Self-Regulatory Organization's Statement of the Purpose of, and the 
Statutory Basis for, the Proposed Rule Change

1. Purpose
    The Exchange proposes to amend Rule 7.31 regarding the Minimum 
Trade Size (``MTS'') Modifier.
    Rule 7.31(i)(3) provides that a Limit IOC Order, Non-Displayed 
Limit Order, MPL Order, or Tracking Order may be designated with an MTS 
Modifier. Rule 7.31(i)(3)(A) currently provides that an MTS must be a 
minimum of a round lot and that an order with an MTS Modifier will be 
rejected if the MTS is less than a round lot or if the MTS is larger 
than the size of the order. The Exchange proposes to amend Rule 
7.31(i)(3)(A) to provide that an MTS may be an odd lot quantity and 
thus proposes to eliminate rule text currently providing that an MTS 
must be a minimum of a round lot and that an order with an MTS of less 
than one round lot would be rejected. The Exchange believes that 
restricting the use of the MTS Modifier to round lot sizes only is 
unnecessary and that providing Participants with the option to use the 
MTS Modifier with an odd lot quantity could increase liquidity and 
enhance opportunities for order execution on the Exchange. The Exchange 
notes that permitting odd-lot order quantities is not novel on the 
Exchange or other equity exchanges and believes that this proposed 
change is consistent with other equity exchanges' approaches to the use 
of instructions similar to the MTS Modifier.\4\
---------------------------------------------------------------------------

    \4\ The rules of Cboe EDGA Exchange, Inc. (``EDGA''), Cboe EDGX 
Exchange, Inc. (``EDGX''), and Members Exchange (``MEMX'') appear to 
permit the use of instructions comparable to the MTS Modifier in any 
size. See EDGA Rules 11.2 (providing that orders are eligible for 
odd-lot, round-lot, and mixed-lot executions unless otherwise 
indicated) and 11.6(h) (defining Minimum Execution Quantity 
instruction); EDGX Rules 11.2 and 11.6(h) (same); MEMX Rules 11.2 
and 11.6(f) (same). See also, e.g., IEX Rule 1190(b)(3) (providing 
that a non-displayed order may be a Minimum Quantity Order and may 
be an odd lot order).
---------------------------------------------------------------------------

    The Exchange also proposes to amend Rule 7.31(i)(3) to include the 
non-displayed ALO Order as an order type that could be designated with 
an MTS Modifier. This clarifying change is intended only to reflect 
current behavior, by providing a complete list of the order types that 
may be designated with an MTS Modifier. The Exchange notes that the 
inclusion of the non-displayed ALO Order \5\ as an order type that may 
be designated with an MTS Modifier is consistent with the existing use 
of the MTS Modifier with non-displayed order types such as Non-
Displayed Limit Orders and MPL Orders (including MPL-ALO Orders). 
Moreover, although the non-displayed ALO Order is a Limit Order that is 
non-displayed, the Exchange believes that specifically including the 
non-displayed ALO Order in the text of Rule 7.31(i)(3) would reduce 
ambiguity as to the order types that may be designated with an MTS 
Modifier.
---------------------------------------------------------------------------

    \5\ An ALO Order is a Non-Routable Limit Order that, unless it 
receives price improvement, will not remove liquidity from the 
Exchange Book; an ALO Order may be designated as non-displayed. See 
Rule 7.31(e)(2).
---------------------------------------------------------------------------

    Because of the technology changes associated with this proposed 
rule change, the Exchange will announce the implementation date by 
Trader Update, which, subject to effectiveness of this proposed rule 
change, will be no later than in the fourth quarter of 2024.
2. Statutory Basis
    The proposed rule change is consistent with Section 6(b) of the 
Act,\6\ in general, and furthers the objectives of Section 6(b)(5),\7\ 
in particular, because it is designed to prevent fraudulent and 
manipulative acts and practices, to promote just and equitable 
principles of trade, to foster cooperation and coordination with 
persons engaged in facilitating transactions in securities, to remove 
impediments to, and perfect the mechanism of, a free and open market 
and a national market system and, in general, to protect investors and 
the public interest.
---------------------------------------------------------------------------

    \6\ 15 U.S.C. 78f(b).
    \7\ 15 U.S.C. 78f(b)(5).
---------------------------------------------------------------------------

    The Exchange believes that the proposed change would remove 
impediments to, and perfect the mechanism of, a free and open market 
and a national market system, and protect investors and the public 
interest because it would provide Participants with the option to use 
the MTS Modifier with odd lot quantities, which could encourage order 
flow to the Exchange and promote opportunities for order execution on 
the Exchange, to the benefit of all market participants. The proposed 
change would also clarify that the MTS Modifier may be used in 
conjunction with non-displayed ALO Orders, thereby removing impediments 
to, and perfecting the mechanism of, a free and open market and a 
national market system by updating Exchange rules to ensure that they 
reflect the current availability of the MTS Modifier and promoting 
consistency and specificity in Exchange rules as to the use of such 
modifier with non-displayed order types. The Exchange notes that the 
proposed change would not otherwise impact the operation of the MTS 
Modifier as provided under current Exchange rules. The Exchange also 
believes that the proposed change would align Exchange rules with the 
use of instructions similar to the MTS Modifier on other equity 
exchanges, thereby removing impediments to, and perfecting the 
mechanism of, a free and open market and a national market system.\8\
---------------------------------------------------------------------------

    \8\ See note 4, supra.
---------------------------------------------------------------------------

B. Self-Regulatory Organization's Statement on Burden on Competition

    The Exchange does not believe that the proposed rule change will 
impose any burden on competition that is not necessary or appropriate 
in furtherance of the purposes of the Act. The proposed change would 
allow the optional MTS Modifier to be used with an odd lot quantity and 
accurately reflect the order types that may be designated with an MTS 
Modifier. The Exchange believes that the proposed change would promote 
competition among exchanges by offering Participants options available 
on other equity exchanges and, to the extent the proposed change would 
increase opportunities for order execution, promote competition by 
making the Exchange a more attractive venue for order flow and 
enhancing market quality for all market participants.

C. Self-Regulatory Organization's Statement on Comments on the Proposed 
Rule Change Received From Members, Participants, or Others

    No written comments were solicited or received with respect to the 
proposed rule change.

III. Date of Effectiveness of the Proposed Rule Change and Timing for 
Commission Action

    The Exchange has filed the proposed rule change pursuant to Section 
19(b)(3)(A)(iii) of the Act \9\ and Rule 19b-4(f)(6) thereunder.\10\ 
Because the proposed rule change does not (i) significantly affect the 
protection of investors or the public interest; (ii) impose any 
significant burden on competition; and (iii) become operative prior to 
30 days from the date on which it was filed, or such shorter time as 
the Commission may designate, if consistent with the protection of 
investors and the public interest, the proposed rule change has become 
effective pursuant to Section

[[Page 78408]]

19(b)(3)(A)(iii) of the Act \11\ and Rule 19b-4(f)(6)(iii) 
thereunder.\12\
---------------------------------------------------------------------------

    \9\ 15 U.S.C. 78s(b)(3)(A)(iii).
    \10\ 17 CFR 240.19b-4(f)(6).
    \11\ 15 U.S.C. 78s(b)(3)(A)(iii).
    \12\ 17 CFR 240.19b-4(f)(6). In addition, Rule 19b-4(f)(6)(iii) 
requires a self-regulatory organization to give the Commission 
written notice of its intent to file the proposed rule change, along 
with a brief description and text of the proposed rule change, at 
least five business days prior to the date of filing of the proposed 
rule change, or such shorter time as designated by the Commission. 
The Exchange has fulfilled this requirement.
---------------------------------------------------------------------------

    A proposed rule change filed under Rule 19b-4(f)(6) \13\ normally 
does not become operative prior to 30 days after the date of the 
filing. However, pursuant to Rule 19b4(f)(6)(iii),\14\ the Commission 
may designate a shorter time if such action is consistent with the 
protection of investors and the public interest. The Exchange has asked 
the Commission to waive the 30-day operative delay so that the proposal 
may take effect as soon as the technology associated with the proposed 
change is available, which is anticipated to be less than 30 days from 
the date of this filing. The Commission believes that waiver of the 
operative delay is consistent with the protection of investors and the 
public interest because the proposal raises no novel issues and would 
allow use of the MTS Modifier with odd lot quantities without delay and 
promote clarity in Exchange rules as to the order types that may be 
designated with an MTS Modifier. Accordingly, the Commission hereby 
waives the 30-day operative delay and designates the proposal operative 
upon filing.\15\

    \14\ 17 CFR 240.19b-4(f)(6)(iii).
    \15\ For purposes only of accelerating the operative date of 
this proposal, the Commission has considered the proposed rule's 
impact on efficiency, competition, and capital formation. 15 U.S.C. 
78c(f).
---------------------------------------------------------------------------

    At any time within 60 days of the filing of such proposed rule 
change, the Commission summarily may temporarily suspend such rule 
change if it appears to the Commission that such action is necessary or 
appropriate in the public interest, for the protection of investors, or 
otherwise in furtherance of the purposes of the Act. If the Commission 
takes such action, the Commission shall institute proceedings under 
Section 19(b)(2)(B) \16\ of the Act to determine whether the proposed 
rule change should be approved or disapproved.
---------------------------------------------------------------------------
