SECURITIES AND EXCHANGE COMMISSION

[SEC File No. 270-318, OMB Control No. 3235-0361]


Submission for OMB Review; Comment Request; Extension: Form ADV-E

Upon Written Request, Copies Available From: Securities and Exchange 
Commission, Office of FOIA Services, 100 F Street NE, Washington, DC 
20549-2736

    Notice is hereby given that, pursuant to the Paperwork Reduction 
Act of 1995 (44 U.S.C. 3501 et seq.), the Securities and Exchange 
Commission (the ``Commission'') has submitted to the Office of 
Management and Budget a request for extension of the previously 
approved collection of information discussed below.
    Form ADV-E (17 CFR 279.8) is the cover sheet for certificates of 
accounting filed pursuant to rule 206(4)-2(a)(4) under the Investment 
Advisers Act of 1940 (17 CFR 275.206(4)-(2)(a)(4)). The rule further 
requires that the public accountant file with the Commission a Form 
ADV-E and accompanying statement within four business days of the 
resignation, dismissal, removal from consideration for being 
reappointed, or other termination of its engagement.
    The Commission has estimated that compliance with the requirement 
to complete Form ADV-E imposes a total burden of approximately 0.05 
hours (3 minutes) per respondent. Based on current information from 
advisers registered with the Commission, the Commission staff estimates 
that 1,946 filings will be submitted with respect to surprise 
examinations and 52 filings will be submitted with respect to 
termination of accountants. Based on these estimates, the total 
estimated annual burden would be 99.90 hours ((1,946 filings x .05 
hours) + (52 filings x .05 hours)).
    The information provided on Form ADV-E is mandatory. Responses will 
not be kept confidential. An agency may not conduct or sponsor a 
collection of information unless it displays a currently valid OMB 
control number. No person shall be subject to any penalty for failing 
to comply with a collection of information subject to the PRA that does 
not display a valid OMB control number.
    Public Comment Instructions: The 30-day public comment period for 
this information collection request opens on December 16, 2024 and 
closes at the end of the day on January 13, 2025. The public may view 
the full information request and submit comments at <a href="https://www.reginfo.gov/public/do/PRAViewICR?ref_nbr=202409-3235-022">https://www.reginfo.gov/public/do/PRAViewICR?ref_nbr=202409-3235-022</a> or email

    Dated: December 9, 2024.
Sherry R. Haywood,
Assistant Secretary.
