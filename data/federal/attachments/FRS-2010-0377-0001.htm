SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION: The Board published an interim final rule in 
the Federal Register on October 28, 2010 (75 FR 66554) (Docket No. R-
1394), amending Regulation Z (Truth in Lending) to implement provisions 
of the Dodd-Frank Wall Street Reform and Consumer Protection Act of 
2010, Public Law 111-208, 124 Stat. 1376 (Jul. 21, 2010).
    In the interim final rule, Docket No. R-1394, published on October 
28, 2010, (75 FR 66554) make the following corrections:
    1. On page 66555, in the first column, line 24, correct ``April 1, 
2010'' to read ``April 1, 2011''.
    2. On page 66556, in the third column, immediately under the 
heading ``IV. Section-by-Section Analysis,'' add the following:

``Section 226.1 Authority, Purpose, Coverage, Organization, Enforcement 
and Liability

Section 226.1(d) Organization

    Section 226.1(d) describes how Regulation Z is organized. Section 
226.1(d)(5) describes Subpart E of Regulation Z, which this interim 
final rule amends by adding new Sec.  226.42, ``Valuation 
Independence.'' The interim final rule also revises comment 1(d)(5)-1 
to add a new subpart 1(d)(5)-1.ii, stating that compliance with the 
interim final rule is mandatory on April 1, 2011, for open- and closed-
end extensions of consumer credit secured by the consumer's principal 
dwelling. The revised comment also states that Sec.  226.36(b), which 
is substantially similar to Sec.  226.42(c) and (e), is removed 
effective April 1, 2011. The comment explains that applications for 
closed-end extensions of credit secured by the consumer's principal 
dwelling that are received by creditors before April 1, 2011, are 
subject to Sec.  226.36(b) regardless of the date on which the 
transaction is consummated. However, parties subject to Sec.  226.36(b) 
may, at their option, choose to comply with Sec.  226.42 instead of 
Sec.  226.36(b), for applications received before April 1, 2011. To 
illustrate, the comment explains that an application for a closed-end 
extension of credit secured by the consumer's principal dwelling 
received by a creditor on March 20, 2011, and consummated on May 1, 
2011, is subject to Sec.  226.36(b), but the creditor may choose to 
comply with Sec.  226.42 instead. The comment further explains that, 
for an application for open- or closed-end credit secured by the 
consumer's principal dwelling that is received on or after April 1, 
2011, the creditor must comply with Sec.  226.42.''

226.42(b)(5)'' to read ``Section 226.42(b)(3)''.
