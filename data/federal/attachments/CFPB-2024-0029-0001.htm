CONSUMER FINANCIAL PROTECTION BUREAU

[Docket No: CFPB-2024-0029]


Privacy Act of 1974; System of Records

AGENCY: Consumer Financial Protection Bureau.

ACTION: Notice of a new system of records.

-----------------------------------------------------------------------

SUMMARY: In accordance with the Privacy Act of 1974, the Consumer 
Financial Protection Bureau (CFPB or Bureau) proposes to establish a 
new CFPB system of records titled, ``CFPB.030--Nonbank Registry'' 
(Nonbank Registry). Generally, ``nonbanks'' are institutions involved 
in the offering or provision of consumer financial products or services 
that are not insured depository institutions or insured credit unions 
(hereinafter referred to as ``nonbanks''). The Nonbank Registry system 
of records covers information collected and maintained as part of the 
CFPB nonbank registration program. The Nonbank Registry enables certain 
nonbanks to register with the CFPB through the Bureau's Nonbank 
Registry portal and to provide additional required information and/or 
other required documents. The records maintained in the Nonbank 
Registry enables the CFPB to gather information from registered 
nonbanks; to monitor and identify consumer risks; to gather information 
and documents to conduct examinations of registered nonbanks subject to 
the CFPB's supervisory authority; and to ensure that registered 
nonbanks subject to the CFPB's supervisory authority are legitimate 
entities and able to perform their obligations to consumers,

[[Page 59901]]

including their obligations under Federal consumer financial law. This 
newly established system of records will be included in the CFPB's 
inventory of records systems.

DATES: Comments must be received no later than August 23, 2024. The new 
system of records will be effective August 23, 2024 unless the comments 
received result in a contrary determination.

SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION: In accordance with the Privacy Act of 1974, 
5 U.S.C. 552a, the CFPB is establishing a new system of records titled, 
``CFPB.030, Nonbank Registry.'' On June 3, 2024, the CFPB published the 
Registry of Nonbank Covered Persons Subject to Certain Agency and Court 
Orders Final Rule (Orders Rule) pursuant to sections 1022 and 1024 of 
the Consumer Financial Protection Act (CFPA) of 2010. The Orders Rule 
imposes specific requirements on ``covered nonbanks,'' as that term is 
defined in section 1092.201(d) of the Orders Rule. Covered nonbanks are 
generally required to register ``covered orders,'' as that term is 
defined in section 1092.201(e) of the Orders Rule, that remain in or 
take effect on or after the Orders Rule's effective date.
    The CFPB's exercise of its nonbank registration rulemaking 
authority expands the category of individuals and records collected and 
maintained on nonbanks to include those required to register with the 
CFPB to enable the Bureau to monitor and reduce the risks to consumers 
posed by these institutions more effectively. The registry also allows 
the Bureau to monitor trends in enforcement and more effectively 
utilize Bureau resources. To this end, the CFPB has created the Nonbank 
Registry portal to facilitate the registration process and information 
collection maintained in the Nonbank Registry system of records for 
nonbanks that are required to register with the CFPB in accordance with 
current or subsequent CFPB regulations. Finally, the CFPB may publish 
certain information collected and maintained in the Nonbank Registry 
system of records as is in the public interest and in accordance with 
CFPB regulations.
