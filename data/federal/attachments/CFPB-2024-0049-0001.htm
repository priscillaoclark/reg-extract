SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION: 
    Title of Collection: Making Ends Meet Survey.
    OMB Control Number: 3170-0080.
    Type of Review: Revision of a currently approved collection.
    Affected Public: Individuals or households.
    Estimated Number of Respondents: 5,500.
    Estimated Total Annual Burden Hours: 2,060.
    Abstract: The Dodd-Frank Wall Street Reform and Consumer Protection 
Act charges the CFPB with researching, analyzing, and reporting on 
topics relating to the Bureau's mission including consumer behavior, 
consumer awareness, and developments in markets for consumer financial 
products and services. To improve its understanding of how consumers 
engage with financial markets, the CFPB has successfully used surveys 
under its ``Making Ends Meet'' program. The ``Making Ends Meet'' 
program has also used the CFPB's Consumer Credit Information Panel 
(CCIP) as a frame to survey people about their experiences in consumer 
credit markets. The CFPB seeks approval for two yearly surveys under 
the ``Making Ends Meet'' program. These surveys solicit information on 
the consumer's experience related to household financial shocks, 
particularly shocks related to the economic effects of the COVID-19 
pandemic, how households respond to those shocks, and the role of 
savings to help provide a financial buffer.
    The first survey will be a follow-up to respondents from the CFPB's 
2024 ``Making Ends Meet'' survey to better understand household 
financial experiences dealing with medical debt as well as consumers' 
interactions with various financial products. The second survey will go 
to a new sample of consumers from the CCIP and will address several 
topics of interest to the CFPB, possibly including the impact of 
natural disasters and other environmental events, credit shopping 
behavior, additional follow-up regarding debt collection, and the 
assessment of various fees throughout the financial services ecosystem.
    Request for Comments: The CFPB published a 60-day Federal Register 
notice on March 26, 2024 (89 FR 20950) under Docket Number: CFPB-2024-
0013. The CFPB is publishing this notice and soliciting comments on: 
(a) Whether the collection of information is

[[Page 79901]]

necessary for the proper performance of the functions of the CFPB, 
including whether the information will have practical utility; (b) The 
accuracy of the CFPB's estimate of the burden of the collection of 
information, including the validity of the methods and the assumptions 
used; (c) Ways to enhance the quality, utility, and clarity of the 
information to be collected; and (d) Ways to minimize the burden of the 
collection of information on respondents, including through the use of 
automated collection techniques or other forms of information 
technology. Comments submitted in response to this notice will be 
reviewed by OMB as part of its review of this request. All comments 
will become a matter of public record.

Anthony May,
Paperwork Reduction Act Officer, Consumer Financial Protection Bureau.
