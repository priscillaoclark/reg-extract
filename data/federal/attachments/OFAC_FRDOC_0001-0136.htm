SUMMARY: The Department of the Treasury's Office of Foreign Assets 
Control (``OFAC'') is amending the Iranian Transactions Regulations in 
the Code of Federal Regulations to expand the scope of Appendix A to 
Part 560 to encompass any person determined by OFAC to be the 
Government of Iran, as that term is defined in those regulations. OFAC 
also is adding to the appendix 22 persons it has determined to be the 
Government of Iran. In addition, OFAC is updating the current list of 
entities in appendix A, removing an entity, and consolidating and 
amending other listings. Finally, OFAC is reformatting and republishing 
in alphabetical order the entire list of persons in the expanded 
appendix.

Background

    The Iranian Transactions Regulations, 31 CFR part 560 (the 
``ITR''), implement a series of Executive orders that began with 
Executive Order 12613, which was issued on October 29, 1987, pursuant 
to authorities including the International Security and Development 
Cooperation Act of 1985 (22 U.S.C. 2349aa-9). In that Order, after 
finding, inter alia, that the Government of Iran was actively 
supporting terrorism as an instrument of state policy, the President 
prohibited the importation of Iranian-origin goods and services. 
Subsequently, in Executive Order 12957, issued on March 15, 1995, under 
the authority of, inter alia, the International Emergency Economic 
Powers Act (50 U.S.C. 1701-1706) (``IEEPA''), the President declared a 
national emergency with respect to the actions and policies of the 
Government of Iran, including its support for international terrorism, 
its efforts to undermine the Middle East peace process, and its efforts 
to acquire weapons of mass destruction and the means to deliver them. 
To deal with that threat, Executive Order 12957 imposed prohibitions on 
certain transactions with respect to the development of Iranian 
petroleum resources. On May 6, 1995, to further respond to this threat, 
the President issued Executive Order 12959, which imposed comprehensive 
trade and financial sanctions on Iran. Finally, on August 19, 1997, the 
President issued Executive Order 13059 consolidating and clarifying the 
previous orders.
    The ITR implement these Executive orders and prohibit various 
transactions, including, among others, transactions with the Government 
of Iran, a term defined in section 560.304. That definition includes 
several categories, one of which is any entity owned or controlled by 
the Government of Iran, a phrase that is itself defined in section 
560.313 of the ITR.
    From its initial publication in 1999 until December 2008, Appendix 
A to Part 560 listed financial institutions that OFAC determined to be 
entities owned or controlled by the Government of Iran, within the 
meaning of sections 560.304 and 560.313 of the ITR. In a final rule 
amending the ITR published on December 4, 2008, OFAC expanded the scope 
of Appendix A to Part 560 to include all categories of entities 
determined to be owned or controlled by the Government of Iran, not 
just financial institutions (73 FR 73788, Dec. 4, 2008). That expansion 
of Appendix A to Part 560 was intended to better assist U.S. persons 
and others engaging in transactions subject to the ITR in complying 
with the ITR by allowing OFAC to give notice when it determined that 
any entity was owned or controlled by the Government of Iran.
    To further assist compliance with the ITR by U.S. persons and 
others engaging in transactions subject to the ITR, OFAC today is 
expanding the scope of Appendix A to Part 560 to encompass all persons 
determined by OFAC to be the Government of Iran, i.e., to come within 
any of the categories comprising the definition of the term Government 
of Iran in section 560.304 of the ITR. That definition includes:
    (a) The state and the Government of Iran, as well as any political 
subdivision, agency, or instrumentality thereof;
    (b) Any entity owned or controlled directly or indirectly by the 
foregoing; and
    (c) Any person to the extent that such person is, or has been, or 
to the extent that there is reasonable cause to believe that such 
person is, or has been, * * * acting or purporting to act directly or 
indirectly on behalf of any of the foregoing * * *.

This expansion in scope of Appendix A to Part 560 will better assist 
U.S. persons and others engaging in transactions subject to the ITR in 
complying with the ITR by identifying additional categories of persons 
that come within the term Government of Iran.
    In addition, OFAC today is adding the following 22 persons to 
Appendix A to Part 560, having determined that they all come within the 
definition of Government of Iran in section 560.304 of the ITR: Bimeh 
Iran Insurance Company (U.K.) Limited, Iran Insurance Company, Intra 
Chem Trading GmbH, Iran Petrochemical Commercial Company, Iranian Oil 
Company (U.K.) Limited, Kala Limited, Kala Pension Trust Limited, MSP 
Kala Naft Co. Tehran, Naftiran Trading Services Co. (NTS) Limited, 
National Iranian Oil Company Pte Ltd, National Petrochemical Company, 
NICO Engineering Limited, NIOC International Affairs (London) Limited, 
NPC International Limited, P.C.C. (Singapore) Private Limited, 
Petrochemical Commercial Company International Limited, Petrochemical 
Commercial Company FZE, Petrochemical Commercial Company (U.K.) 
Limited, Petroiran Development Company (PEDCO) Limited, Petropars 
International FZE, Petropars Ltd, and Petropars UK Limited.
    OFAC also is updating the current list of persons in Appendix A to 
Part 560. As a result, OFAC is removing the Iran Overseas Trading 
Company Limited (Subsidiary) from the appendix, because this entity has 
been dissolved and no longer exists, and is amending the listing for 
Naftiran Intertrade Co. (NICO) Limited to reflect current identifying 
information. In addition, OFAC is consolidating the listings for the 
Iran Overseas Investment Bank Limited (Representative Office), the Iran 
Overseas Investment Bank Limited (Agency), and the Iran Overseas 
Investment Corporation Limited under

[[Page 34631]]

Bank Saderat PLC, and is consolidating the listings for Agricultural 
Cooperative Bank of Iran, Agricultural Development Bank of Iran, Bank 
Josiaiyi Keshahvarzi, and Bank Taavon Keshavarzi Iran under Bank 
Keshavarzi Iran. Finally, OFAC is reformatting and republishing in 
alphabetical order the entire list of persons in the expanded appendix 
A.
    It is important to note that Appendix A to Part 560 is not a 
comprehensive list of persons falling within the definition of 
Government of Iran. Even if a person is not listed in Appendix A to 
Part 560, if the person satisfies the definition of the term Government 
of Iran in the ITR, U.S. persons and others engaging in transactions 
subject to the ITR are prohibited from engaging in transactions with 
that person, regardless of its location, to the same extent they are 
prohibited from engaging in transactions with the persons listed in 
Appendix A to Part 560. U.S. persons and others engaging in 
transactions subject to the ITR also are prohibited from engaging in 
most transactions with any person located in Iran, even if that person 
does not come within the definition of the term Government of Iran. 
Finally, a person listed in Appendix A to Part 560 also may be subject 
to other sanctions programs administered by OFAC, in which case that 
person's name would also appear in the list at Appendix A to 31 CFR 
chapter V. Such a person is identified in Appendix A to Part 560 by 
references (``tags''), located at the end of the person's listing, to 
the sanctions program(s) to which the person is subject (e.g., [IRAN] 
[NPWMD] or [IRAN] [SDGT]).

Public Participation

    Because the amendment of the ITR involves a foreign affairs 
function, the provisions of Executive Order 12866 and the 
Administrative Procedure Act (5 U.S.C. 553) requiring notice of 
proposed rulemaking, opportunity for public participation, and delay in 
effective date are inapplicable. Because no notice of proposed 
rulemaking is required for this rule, the Regulatory Flexibility Act (5 
U.S.C. 601-612) does not apply.

Paperwork Reduction Act

    The collections of information related to the ITR are contained in 
31 CFR part 501 (the ``Reporting, Procedures and Penalties 
Regulations''). Pursuant to the Paperwork Reduction Act of 1995 (44 
U.S.C. 3507), those collections of information have been approved by 
the Office of Management and Budget under control number 1505-0164. An 
agency may not conduct or sponsor, and a person is not required to 
respond to, a collection of information unless the collection of 
information displays a valid control number.

List of Subjects in 31 CFR Part 560

    Administrative practice and procedure, Banks, Banking, Brokers, 
Foreign Trade, Investments, Loans, Securities, Iran.

2. Revise Appendix A to Part 560 to read as follows:

Appendix A To Part 560--Persons Determined To Be The Government Of 
Iran, As Defined In Sec.  560.304 Of This Part

    This non-exhaustive appendix lists persons determined by the Office 
of Foreign Assets Control (``OFAC'') to be the Government of Iran, as 
defined in Sec.  560.304 of this part. The persons listed below are 
considered to be the Government of Iran not only when they operate from 
the locations listed below, but also when they operate from any other 
location. The names and addresses are subject to change. This part 560 
contains prohibitions against engaging in most transactions with 
persons that meet the definition of the Government of Iran, whether 
such persons are located or incorporated inside or outside of Iran. 
Moreover, regardless of whether a person is listed below, if the person 
comes within the definition of Government of Iran in Sec.  560.304, the 
prohibitions on engaging in transactions with the person, wherever 
located worldwide, apply to the same extent they would apply if the 
person were listed in this appendix. Note that the prohibitions in this 
part 560 also apply to most transactions with persons located in Iran 
that are not the Government of Iran. Finally, a person listed in 
Appendix A to Part 560 also may be subject to other sanctions programs 
administered by OFAC, in which case that person's name would also 
appear in the list at Appendix A to 31 CFR chapter V. Such a person is 
identified in Appendix A to Part 560 by references (``tags''), located 
at the end of the person's listing, to the sanctions program(s) to 
which the person is subject (e.g., [IRAN] [NPWMD] or [IRAN] [SDGT]).

Notes to Appendix A to Part 560:

    1. The alphabetical list below provides the following information 
concerning persons determined by OFAC to be the Government of Iran: the 
name (including known former or alternate names), address, [IRAN] tag,

under which the person also is blocked.
    2. The abbreviations used in this appendix are ``a.k.a.'' (also 
known as) and ``f.k.a.'' (formerly known as).
    3. The references to sanctions programs in 31 CFR chapter V 
include: [IRAN] (Iranian Transactions Regulations, part 560); [NPWMD]

    4. The names of persons listed in Appendix A to Part 560 also are 
published on OFAC's Specially Designated Nationals and Blocked Persons 
List (``SDN'' list), available on OFAC's Web site. New names of persons
