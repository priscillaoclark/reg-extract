SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION:

A. Policy Objectives

    The Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation (FDIC) has a long history 
of providing deposit insurance coverage in the island nations that 
formerly were part of the Trust Territory of the Pacific Islands, which 
include the Federated States of Micronesia (FSM), the Republic of the 
Marshall Islands (Marshall Islands), and the Republic of Palau (Palau). 
Collectively, these three countries are known as the Freely Associated 
States. At one time, the FDIC provided deposit insurance coverage 
pursuant to the Federal Deposit Insurance Act (FDI Act) on the basis 
that these islands were part of the Trust Territory of the Pacific 
Islands administered by the United States. The FSM, the Marshall 
Islands, and Palau later became independent nations, and each entered 
into a Compact of Free Association (Compacts) with the United States 
that provided among other economic benefits, the availability of the 
FDIC's deposit insurance. The unique and somewhat complex legal 
framework comprised of the Compacts, their relevant subsidiary 
agreements, implementing legislation, and the FDI Act, is what has 
allowed the FDIC to insure deposits in the Freely Associated States.
    The United States recently negotiated, and Congress approved, new 
agreements related to the Compacts with each of the Freely Associated 
States. Some of these new agreements include provisions relating to 
deposit insurance coverage for banks chartered by the Freely Associated 
States. In light of this, the FDIC believes it would be beneficial to 
clarify the application of the FDI Act and the deposit insurance 
regulations to the legacy branches of U.S. insured depository 
institutions (IDIs) operating in the Freely Associated States. For 
these reasons, the FDIC is issuing this interim final rule to clarify 
that it insures the deposits of legacy branches of U.S. IDIs operating 
in the FSM, the Marshall Islands, and Palau.

B. Background

    The interim final rule implements the FDI Act, rather than the 
Compacts. However, a brief historical discussion and overview of the 
Compacts provides helpful context for understanding the interim final 
rule, which is based upon the special and historic relationship between 
the United States and the Freely Associated States.
    The FSM, the Marshall Islands, and Palau were once part of the 
Trust Territory of the Pacific Islands, established by the United 
Nations following World War II and administered by the United States 
pursuant to a trusteeship agreement.\1\ In 1981, Congress added the 
Trust Territory of the Pacific Islands to the FDI Act's definition of 
``State,'' with the result that deposits in banks located in the Trust 
Territory were eligible to be insured by the FDIC.\2\
---------------------------------------------------------------------------

    \1\ In addition to the FSM, the Marshall Islands, and Palau, the 
Trust Territory of the Pacific Islands also included the Northern 
Mariana Islands. The Northern Mariana Islands became a self-
governing commonwealth of the United States in 1986, and has since 
been added to the FDI Act's definition of ``State.'' See 12 U.S.C. 
1813(a)(3).
    \2\ Public Law 97-110, sec. 103 (Dec. 26, 1981).
---------------------------------------------------------------------------

1986 Compacts

    The FSM, the Marshall Islands, and Palau each adopted a Compact of 
Free Association with the United States that was subsequently approved 
by the U.S. Congress. Each of these nations then exited the Trust 
Territory of the Pacific Islands by becoming an independent nation. 
Specifically, the U.S. Congress approved a Compact with the FSM and the 
Marshall Islands through the Compact of Free Association Act of 1985, 
which became effective in 1986.\3\ The FSM and the Marshall Islands 
became independent effective October 2, 1986, and November 3, 1986, 
respectively. Congress approved the Compact with Palau in 1986,\4\ and 
Palau became independent effective October 1, 1994.\5\ These Compacts 
contained provisions requiring certain agencies of the U.S. Government, 
including the

[[Page 65167]]

FDIC, to provide their programs and services to each nation.\6\

    \3\ Public Law 99-239 (Jan. 14, 1986).
    \4\ Public Law 99-658 (Nov. 14, 1986); Public Law 101-219 (Dec. 
12, 1989).
    \5\ Public Law 99-658 was a joint resolution to approve the 
Palau Compact. Section 101(d) of that Act provided that the Compact 
would not take effect until, among other things, enactment of a 
joint resolution authorizing entry into force of the Compact. Public 
Law 101-219 was that joint resolution. Further delay, until 1994, 
occurred due to the need for multiple plebiscites to secure approval 
on Palau for implementation of the Compact.
    \6\ See Public Law 99-239, sec. 111(a) (making the programs and 
services of the FDIC available to the FSM and the Marshall Islands); 
Public Law 99-658, sec. 102(b) (applying sec. 111(a) of Public Law 
99-239 to Palau). The Compacts provided continuing authority for the 
FDIC to insure banks chartered by the FSM, the Marshall Islands, and 
Palau, which, due to their exit from the Trust Territory of the 
Pacific Islands, no longer fell within the FDI Act's definition of 
``State.''
---------------------------------------------------------------------------

2003 Compacts

    The United States, the FSM, and the Marshall Islands eventually 
renewed negotiations concerning their Compact, resulting in separate 
amended agreements between the United States and each of these nations 
that took effect in 2003.\7\ The amended Compacts included changes to, 
among other things, the provision of deposit insurance coverage. 
Specifically, section 221(a)(5) of the amended U.S.-FSM Compact stated 
that the FDIC would provide deposit insurance ``for the benefit only of 
the Bank of the Federated States of Micronesia,'' in accordance with a 
Federal Programs and Services Agreement executed by the two nations.\8\ 
\9\ By contrast, the corresponding provision of the amended Compact 
with the Marshall Islands, section 221(a), included no reference to 
deposit insurance.\10\

Review of Palau Compact

    The U.S.-Palau Compact does not include a termination date, but 
requires formal review of its terms by the 15-year, 30-year, and 40-
year anniversaries of its effective date. The direct economic 
assistance provisions of the Compact expired in 2009, and, following 
the required 15-year review, were renegotiated and signed on September 
3, 2010. Congress approved a Compact Review Agreement with respect to 
the U.S.-Palau Compact in December 2017.\11\

2023 Compact Amendments

    During 2023, the United States and each of the Freely Associated 
States concluded new agreements relating to their respective Compacts. 
The U.S. Congress approved the new agreements in March 2024.\12\ Some 
of the new agreements include the provision of deposit insurance by the 
FDIC.

C. Statutory Framework

    The FDI Act governs the FDIC's deposit insurance coverage for U.S. 
banks and savings associations. The statute includes two provisions on 
foreign deposits that are particularly relevant to the interim final 
rule.

Section 3

    The FDI Act defines the ``deposits'' insured by the FDIC. As early 
as the Banking Act of 1933, Congress distinguished between domestic and 
foreign deposits, and the current statutory definition of ``deposit'' 
makes clear that foreign branch deposits of IDIs are not deposits for 
the purposes of the FDI Act except under prescribed circumstances. In 
particular, section 3(l)(5) of the FDI Act excludes from the definition 
of ``deposit'' deposit obligations of a foreign branch of an IDI that 
would otherwise fall within the definition of ``deposit'' under section 
3(l) of the FDI Act unless they (1) would be deposits if carried on the 
books and records of the IDI in the United States; and (2) are 
expressly payable at an office of the IDI located in the United 
States.\13\ The FDIC has generally referred to this second prong of 
subparagraph (A) of section 3(l)(5) of the FDI Act as requiring ``dual 
payability'' of a deposit.
---------------------------------------------------------------------------

    \13\ 12 U.S.C. 1813(l)(5)(A).
---------------------------------------------------------------------------

Section 41

    Section 41 of the FDI Act generally prohibits the payment of 
deposit insurance with respect to certain deposits carried on the books 
and records of foreign branches of U.S. IDIs.\14\ Section 41(a) 
generally prohibits payment of obligations that would have the direct 
or indirect effect of satisfying any claim against an IDI which would 
constitute deposits ``but for subparagraphs (A) and (B) of section 
3(l)(5).'' \15\
---------------------------------------------------------------------------

    \14\ 12 U.S.C. 1831r.
    \15\ 12 U.S.C. 1831r(a).
---------------------------------------------------------------------------

    As described above, subparagraph (A) of section 3(l)(5) of the FDI 
Act excludes an obligation from being considered a ``deposit'' unless 
(1) the obligation would constitute a ``deposit'' if carried on the 
IDI's books and records in a State; and (2) the contract expressly 
provides dual payability. An obligation that constitutes a deposit 
``but for'' subparagraph (A) is one that is excluded from the 
``deposit'' definition only because it does not satisfy the two-part 
test in subparagraph (A). Put differently, obligations that constitute 
deposits ``but for'' subparagraph (A) include those that would 
constitute a ``deposit'' if carried on the IDI's books and records in a 
State, yet are not expressly payable at a location of the IDI within a 
State. Section 41 therefore prohibits the FDIC from paying deposit 
insurance on obligations of IDIs' foreign branches that are not dually 
payable. Dual payability is, in effect, a statutory prerequisite for 
deposit insurance with respect to U.S. IDIs' foreign branch deposits.

D. 2013 Rulemaking on the Definition of ``Insured Deposit''

    While dual payability is a statutory prerequisite for deposit 
insurance, the FDIC has also used its authority to limit the 
availability of deposit insurance for IDIs' foreign branch deposits. In 
2013, the FDIC amended its deposit insurance rules to clarify the 
status of deposits maintained in foreign branches of U.S. banks.\16\ 
This action was taken, among other reasons, to address a proposal by 
the Financial Services Authority of the United Kingdom to prohibit non-
European Economic Area banks, including U.S. banks, from accepting 
deposits in their United Kingdom branches unless claims of United 
Kingdom depositors were treated the same as domestic depositors in 
resolution proceedings of the bank.
---------------------------------------------------------------------------

    \16\ See 78 FR 56583 (Sept. 13, 2013).
---------------------------------------------------------------------------

    The 2013 rule made clear that if a bank's deposits carried on the 
books of its foreign branches were made dually payable under section 
3(l)(5)(A) of the FDI Act, this could make them deposits for purposes 
of depositor preference in resolution proceedings, but would not make 
them insured deposits. Specifically, the 2013 rule amended 12 CFR 
330.3(e) of the FDIC's deposit insurance regulations to provide that 
obligations of IDIs payable solely at an office of the IDI located 
outside any State (as defined in section 3(a)(3) of the FDI Act) are 
not ``deposits'' for purposes of 12 CFR part 330. Thus, obligations 
that are not dually payable may not be considered ``deposits.'' The 
2013 rule further provided that even if such obligations are made 
dually payable at an office of the IDI located within a State, they are 
not ``insured deposits'' for purposes of 12 CFR part 330. The 2013 rule 
also included a rule of construction for overseas military banking 
facilities operated under U.S. Department of Defense regulations, 
stating that such offices would not be considered to be located outside 
any State. While the focus of the 2013 rule was clarifying the effect 
of dual

[[Page 65168]]

payability, the FDIC also discussed the rule's effect on deposits in 
the Freely Associated States. Specifically, the FDIC stated that the 
2013 rule was not intended to ``affect the status of insured deposits, 
if any, located in the former Trust Territories.'' \17\
---------------------------------------------------------------------------

    \17\ 78 FR 56583, 56587 (Sept. 13, 2013). As explained above, 
eligibility of a U.S. IDI's foreign branch obligations for deposit 
insurance coverage under the FDI Act would depend upon whether the 
deposits were expressly payable at an office of the IDI located in a 
State.
---------------------------------------------------------------------------

E. Statutory Authority for Interim Final Rule

    The FDIC issues rules and regulations necessary to carry out the 
statutory mandates of the FDI Act. Providing deposit insurance to IDIs 
and maintaining public confidence in the banking system through deposit 
insurance in the event of a U.S. bank's insolvency are two central 
functions of the FDIC. In order to permit the FDIC to carry out these 
functions successfully, the FDIC is authorized to undertake rulemaking 
to implement the FDI Act effectively, particularly with respect to its 
deposit insurance functions.
    The FDI Act contains several provisions granting the FDIC authority 
to issue regulations to carry out its core functions and 
responsibilities, which include the duty ``to insure the deposits of 
all insured depository institutions.'' Section 11(d)(4)(B)(iv) 
authorizes the FDIC to promulgate ``such regulations as may be 
necessary to assure that the requirements of this section [section 11, 
which addresses the payment of deposit insurance] can be implemented 
with respect to each insured depository institution in the event of its 
insolvency.'' \18\ Other grants of FDIC rulemaking authority can be 
found in section 9(a)(Tenth) of the FDI Act, authorizing the FDIC's 
Board of Directors to prescribe ``such rules and regulations as it may 
deem necessary to carry out the provisions of this chapter,'' and 
section 10(g) of the FDI Act, authorizing the FDIC to ``prescribe 
regulations'' and ``define terms as necessary to carry out'' the FDI 
Act.\19\

    \19\ 12 U.S.C. 1819(a)(Tenth); 1820(g).
---------------------------------------------------------------------------

F. Interim Final Rule

    As noted above, in light of the FDIC's role in the Freely 
Associated States under the new Compact-related agreements, the FDIC 
believes it would be beneficial to clarify the application of the FDI 
Act and the deposit insurance regulations to the legacy branches of 
U.S. IDIs operating in the Freely Associated States. The interim final 
rule clarifies that the FDIC, pursuant to the FDI Act, insures the 
deposits of legacy branches of U.S. IDIs operating in the FSM, the 
Marshall Islands, and Palau, better aligning the regulation with the 
historical coverage provided for these deposits.
    The interim final rule amends 12 CFR 330.3(e) of the FDIC's deposit 
insurance regulations, which governs deposits of IDIs that are payable 
outside of the United States and certain other locations. Currently 
under the regulation, an obligation of an IDI that is payable solely at 
an office of the IDI located outside any State is not considered a 
``deposit'' for purposes of the deposit insurance regulations.\20\ 
Where an obligation of an IDI is carried on the books and records of an 
office of the IDI located outside any State, the regulations provide 
that it shall not be considered an insured deposit, even if it is also 
made payable at an office of the IDI located within any State.\21\ 
Essentially, where obligations booked outside the U.S. are made dually 
payable, they may be entitled to depositor preference (payment ahead of 
the institution's other creditors), but are not generally eligible for 
deposit insurance coverage. The regulation at 12 CFR 330.3(e)(3) 
includes a rule of construction providing a limited exception to these 
general rules for overseas military banking facilities operated under 
U.S. Department of Defense regulations. Military banking facilities are 
not considered to be offices located outside any State under the 
regulation, meaning that military banking facility deposits are 
eligible to be insured.
---------------------------------------------------------------------------

    \20\ 12 CFR 330.3(e)(1).
    \21\ 12 CFR 330.3(e)(2).
---------------------------------------------------------------------------

    The interim final rule amends the rule of construction in 12 CFR 
330.3(e) to apply expressly to deposits of legacy branches of U.S. IDIs 
operating in the FSM, the Marshall Islands, and Palau. Such branches 
will not be considered to be offices located outside any State for 
purposes of the deposit insurance rules, meaning that their deposits, 
if dually payable, would be eligible to be insured by the FDIC pursuant 
to 12 CFR part 330.
    The coverage for U.S. IDIs' legacy branches provided by the rule is 
intended to function as a limited-scope exception to the general rule 
that excludes IDIs' foreign branch deposits from deposit insurance 
coverage. This limited exception aligns the regulation with the 
historical coverage that has been provided for banks operating in the 
Freely Associated States through the special and historical 
relationship the United States has maintained with each of the Freely 
Associated States. Accordingly, the exception provided by the interim 
final rule is limited to the legacy branches of U.S. IDIs, meaning the 
number of branches operated by each U.S. IDI as of the interim final 
rule's effective date. Any changes to branch locations remain subject 
to existing applicable requirements depending on the circumstances.\22\ 
The FDIC believes that limiting coverage to legacy branches of U.S. 
IDIs serves the FDIC's policy objectives while promoting consistency, 
to the extent possible, with the rules that generally apply to foreign 
deposits.
---------------------------------------------------------------------------

    \22\ See 12 CFR part 303, subparts C, D, and J.
---------------------------------------------------------------------------

    As explained above, dual payability is a statutory prerequisite for 
deposit insurance with respect to U.S. IDIs' foreign branch deposits. 
Therefore, deposits of U.S. IDIs' legacy branches in the Freely 
Associated States are only eligible for deposit insurance if they have 
been made dually payable. This means that, under the contract, they are 
expressly payable at an office of the IDI located in a State (as 
defined in 12 U.S.C. 1813(a)(3)).
    Importantly, all dually payable deposits of the legacy branches of 
U.S. IDIs are eligible for deposit insurance coverage under the interim 
final rule.\23\ Coverage is not limited to deposit balances maintained 
by the depositor as of the rule's effective date, or limited to deposit 
accounts opened prior to the rule's effective date. This aspect of the 
interim final rule ensures that coverage will be easily understood by 
consumers and bankers. It also reduces operational complexity for the 
FDIC in the event of a bank failure that would require a deposit 
insurance determination. Under the interim final rule, calculation of 
deposit insurance coverage will be determined by application of the 
deposit insurance regulations that generally apply to all IDIs, found 
in 12 CFR part 330.
---------------------------------------------------------------------------

    \23\ Deposit insurance coverage only applies to ``deposits'' as 
that term is defined in the FDI Act. Other types of products, such 
as stocks, bonds, money market mutual funds, securities, 
commodities, and crypto assets are not insured under the interim 
final rule.
---------------------------------------------------------------------------

    It is important to note that the interim final rule does not affect 
the provision of deposit insurance to banks chartered by any of the 
Freely Associated States or branches of such banks. This is because the 
rule is intended to clarify the application of the FDI Act to branches 
of U.S.-chartered IDIs. Deposit insurance coverage is provided to 
certain banks chartered by the Freely Associated States pursuant to 
separate authority provided by legislation concerning the Compact-
related

[[Page 65169]]

agreements as discussed in further detail above.\24\
---------------------------------------------------------------------------

    \24\ The FDIC currently insures deposits of one bank chartered 
by the Federated States of Micronesia, the Bank of the Federated 
States of Micronesia, pursuant to this separate authority. The 
interim final rule does not affect deposit insurance coverage for 
this bank.
---------------------------------------------------------------------------

G. Expected Effects

    The interim final rule amends 12 CFR part 330 to clarify that the 
FDIC insures dually payable deposits of the legacy branches of U.S. 
IDIs operating in the Freely Associated States. Given that these 
deposits have historically been and are currently insured, the interim 
final rule will not change the deposit insurance coverage for these 
deposits, as compared to a baseline scenario in which the interim final 
rule had not been promulgated. Thus, the effects of the rule are likely 
limited to the increased awareness of deposit insurance coverage in the 
Freely Associated States and the reduced likelihood of confusion 
regarding such coverage.
    Any costs imposed by the interim final rule will directly affect 
IDIs that operate legacy branches in the Freely Associated States. 
According to recent Summary of Deposit data,\25\ there are currently 
three IDIs operating eight total branches in these areas. As of June 
30, 2023, these branches hold approximately $731 million in deposits. 
As discussed previously, the interim rule does not affect the provision 
of deposit insurance at these branches, so the interim final rule will 
likely not result in any operational changes at affected IDIs. Costs 
incurred by these IDIs are likely limited to costs associated with 
clarifications to the IDIs' customers regarding the nature of deposit 
insurance for products offered at these branches. The FDIC does not 
have data to quantify these costs, but believes they are de minimis.
---------------------------------------------------------------------------

    \25\ FDIC Summary of Deposits, as of June 30, 2023.
---------------------------------------------------------------------------

    The interim final rule will benefit both IDIs operating branches in 
the Freely Associated States as well as their customers. The 
publication of the interim final rule will remind affected IDIs of the 
statutory prerequisites for deposit insurance under the FDI Act with 
regards to deposits held in affected legacy branches. To the extent 
that customers in the Freely Associated States are unclear as to the 
status of deposit insurance for their deposits, the interim final rule 
could pose benefits to those customers. The clarity provided by these 
IDIs to holders of dually payable deposits could reinforce and/or 
increase awareness of the extent to which or the manner in which the 
IDIs' products are insured by the FDIC. This clarity will help 
customers more clearly understand when their funds are protected by the 
FDIC's deposit insurance. These benefits, in whole, will reinforce the 
role of FDIC deposit insurance and bolster confidence in the U.S. 
banking system in the Freely Associated States. Given that dually 
payable deposits in the Freely Associated States have been treated as 
FDIC-insured since 1981, the FDIC believes these benefits are likely de 
minimis.\26\

    The FDIC invites comments on these expected effects. In particular, 
are there effects of the interim final rule that the FDIC did not 
consider?

    The FDIC invites comments on all aspects of the interim final rule. 
In particular, the FDIC requests comment on the following:
    1. Is there additional information that would be helpful in further 
clarifying the scope of the rule?
    2. Are there legal or policy considerations regarding deposit 
insurance coverage for U.S. IDIs' branches in the Freely Associated 
States that are relevant, but not discussed in the interim final rule?

I. Administrative Law Matters

Administrative Procedure Act

    The FDIC is issuing the interim final rule without prior notice and 
the opportunity for public comment and the delayed effective date 
ordinarily prescribed by the Administrative Procedure Act (APA).\27\ 
Pursuant to section 553(b)(B) of the APA, general notice and the 
opportunity for public comment are not required with respect to a 
rulemaking when an ``agency for good cause finds (and incorporates the 
finding and a brief statement of reasons therefore in the rules issued) 
that notice and public procedure thereon are impracticable, 
unnecessary, or contrary to the public interest.'' \28\
---------------------------------------------------------------------------

    \27\ 5 U.S.C. 553.
    \28\ 5 U.S.C. 553(b)(B).
---------------------------------------------------------------------------

    The FDIC believes that the public interest would be best served if 
the interim final rule is effective immediately upon publication in the 
Federal Register. The interim final rule aligns the FDIC's regulation 
with the deposit insurance coverage historically provided by the FDIC 
for IDIs in the Freely Associated States, clarifying the application of 
12 CFR 330.3(e) of the FDIC's regulations in this context. Moreover, a 
delayed effective date could lead depositors of IDIs in the Freely 
Associated States to question whether their deposits are insured during 
the comment period. The FDIC has therefore determined that the public 
notice and participation ordinarily required by the APA before a 
regulation may take effect would, in this case, be contrary to the 
public interest and that good cause exists for waiving the customary 
30-day delayed effective date.
    Nevertheless, the FDIC desires to have the benefit of public 
comment before adopting a permanent final rule, and thus invites 
interested parties to submit comments during a 60-day comment period. 
In adopting a final regulation, the FDIC will revise the interim final 
rule if appropriate in light of the comments received.

Riegle Community Development and Regulatory Improvement Act

    The Riegle Community Development and Regulatory Improvement Act of 
1994 generally provides that new regulations or amendments to 
regulations prescribed by a Federal banking agency that impose 
additional reporting, disclosure, or other new requirements on IDIs 
shall take effect on the first day of a calendar quarter that begins on 
or after the date on which the regulations are published in final form, 
unless the agency determines, for good cause published with the rule, 
that the rule should become effective for such time.\29\ For the 
reasons discussed above, the FDIC has determined that good cause exists 
for the interim final rule to become effective immediately upon 
publication in the Federal Register.
---------------------------------------------------------------------------

    \29\ 12 U.S.C. 4802.
---------------------------------------------------------------------------

Paperwork Reduction Act

    The Paperwork Reduction Act of 1995 (44 U.S.C. 3501-3521) states 
that no agency may conduct or sponsor, nor is the respondent required 
to respond to, an information collection unless it displays a currently 
valid Office of Management and Budget (OMB) control number. The interim 
final rule does not create new or revise any existing information 
collection requirements, and therefore, the FDIC will make no 
submissions to OMB in connection with this interim final rule.

Regulatory Flexibility Act

    The Regulatory Flexibility Act (RFA) requires an agency to consider 
whether the rules it proposes will have a significant economic impact 
on a substantial number of small entities. The RFA applies only to 
rules for which an agency publishes a general notice of proposed 
rulemaking pursuant to 5

[[Page 65170]]

U.S.C. 553(b). As discussed previously, consistent with section 
553(b)(B) of the APA, the FDIC has determined for good cause that 
notice and opportunity for public comment prior to the rule's effective 
date is contrary to the public interest, and therefore is not issuing a 
notice of proposed rulemaking. Accordingly, the FDIC has concluded that 
the RFA's requirements relating to initial and final regulatory 
flexibility analyses do not apply. Nevertheless, the FDIC is interested 
in receiving feedback on ways that it could reduce any potential burden 
of the interim final rule on small entities.

Congressional Review Act

    For purposes of the Congressional Review Act, the OMB makes a 
determination as to whether a final rule constitutes a ``major'' rule. 
If a rule is deemed a ``major rule'' by the OMB, the Congressional 
Review Act generally provides that the rule may not take effect until 
at least 60 days following its publication.
    The Congressional Review Act defines a ``major rule'' as any rule 
that the Administrator of the Office of Information and Regulatory 
Affairs of the OMB finds has resulted in or is likely to result in (1) 
an annual effect on the economy of $100,000,000 or more; (2) a major 
increase in costs or prices for consumers, individual industries, 
Federal, State, or local government agencies or geographic regions, or 
(3) significant adverse effects on competition, employment, investment, 
productivity, innovation, or on the ability of United States-based 
enterprises to compete with foreign-based enterprises in domestic and 
export markets.
    The OMB has determined that the interim final rule is not a major 
rule for purposes of the Congressional Review Act. The FDIC will submit 
the rule and other appropriate reports to Congress and the Government 
Accountability Office for review.

Plain Language

    Section 722 of the Gramm-Leach-Bliley Act \30\ requires the Federal 
banking agencies to use plain language in all proposed and final rules 
published after January 1, 2000. The FDIC has sought to present the 
interim final rule in a simple and straightforward manner. The FDIC 
invites comments on whether the interim final rule is clearly stated 
and effectively organized and how the FDIC might make the proposal 
easier to understand.
