---------------------------------------------------------------------------

I. Self-Regulatory Organization's Statement of the Terms of Substance 
of the Proposed Rule Change

    The Exchange proposes to amend Exchange Rule 2613(a), Usage of Data 
Feeds, to disclose that the Exchange will utilize direct data feeds 
from the Investors Exchange LLC (``IEX'') when performing order 
handling, order execution, routing, and related compliance processes 
for equity securities.
    The text of the proposed rule change is available on the Exchange's 
website at <a href="https://www.miaxglobal.com/markets/us-equities/pearl-equities/rule-filings">https://www.miaxglobal.com/markets/us-equities/pearl-equities/rule-filings</a>, at MIAX Pearl's principal office, and at the 
Commission's Public Reference Room.

II. Self-Regulatory Organization's Statement of the Purpose of, and 
Statutory Basis for, the Proposed Rule Change

    In its filing with the Commission, the Exchange included statements 
concerning the purpose of and basis for the proposed rule change and 
discussed any comments it received on the proposed rule change. The 
text of these statements may be examined at the places specified in 
Item IV below. The Exchange has prepared summaries, set forth in 
sections A, B, and C below, of the most significant aspects of such 
statements.

A. Self-Regulatory Organization's Statement of the Purpose of, and 
Statutory Basis for, the Proposed Rule Change

1. Purpose
    Exchange Rule 2613 identifies the data feeds that the Exchange 
utilizes for the handling, execution, and routing of orders in equity 
securities on the Exchange's equity trading platform (``MIAX Pearl 
Equities''), as well as for surveillance necessary to monitor 
compliance with applicable securities laws and Exchange Rules. The 
Exchange currently utilizes IEX market data from the Consolidated 
Quotation System (``CQS'')/UTP Quotation Data Feed (``UQDF'') for these 
purposes on MIAX Pearl Equities. The Exchange intends to begin to 
utilize IEX's direct feeds in place of market data from the CQS/UQDF. 
Therefore, the Exchange proposes to amend Exchange Rule 2613(a) to 
reflect that the Exchange will utilize IEX's direct feeds in place of 
market data from the CQS/UQDF when performing order handling, order 
execution, routing, and related compliance processes for equity 
securities on MIAX Pearl Equities. The Exchange does not currently 
utilize a secondary source for data from IEX. Once it begins to utilize 
direct feeds for data from IEX, the Exchange will also begin to utilize 
CQS/UQDF as a secondary source of data from IEX on MIAX Pearl Equities.
Implementation
    Due to the technological changes associated with this proposed 
change, the Exchange will issue a trading alert publicly announcing the 
implementation date of this proposed rule change. The Exchange 
anticipates that the implementation date will be in either the second 
or third quarter of 2024.
2. Statutory Basis
    The proposed rule change is consistent with Section 6(b) of the 
Act,\3\ in general, and furthers the objectives of Section 6(b)(5),\4\ 
in particular, because it is designed to prevent fraudulent and 
manipulative acts and practices, to promote just and equitable 
principles of trade, to foster cooperation and coordination with 
persons engaged in regulating, clearing, settling, processing 
information with respect to, and facilitating transactions in 
securities, to remove impediments to and perfect the mechanism of a 
free and open market and a national market system, and, in general, to 
protect investors and the public interest.
---------------------------------------------------------------------------

    \3\ 15 U.S.C. 78f(b).
    \4\ 15 U.S.C. 78f(b)(5).
---------------------------------------------------------------------------

    The proposal to update Exchange Rule 2613(a) to reflect that the 
Exchange will utilize IEX's direct feeds in place of market data from 
the CQS/UQDF on MIAX Pearl Equities will continue to provide market 
participants with insight and transparency into which data feeds the 
Exchange utilizes when performing order handling, order execution, 
routing, and related compliance processes for equity securities. The 
Exchange's proposal to utilize IEX's direct feeds promotes just and 
equitable principles of trade because it will allow the Exchange to 
receive market data directly from IEX, thereby potentially enhancing 
the performance of its order handling, order execution, routing, and 
related compliance processes for equity securities. The proposed rule 
changes also remove impediments to and perfects the mechanism of a free 
and open market and protects investors and the public interest because 
it will continue to ensure that Exchange Rule 2613(a) accurately 
reflects the Exchange's sources of market data it utilizes for each 
other equities exchange and the Financial Industry Regulatory 
Authority, Inc.'s Alternative Display Facility.

B. Self-Regulatory Organization's Statement on Burden on Competition

    The Exchange does not believe that the proposed rule change will 
impose any burden on competition that is not necessary or appropriate 
in furtherance of the purposes of the Act. To the contrary, the 
Exchange believes the proposal would enhance competition by

[[Page 5949]]

enhancing transparency and enabling market participants to better 
assess the quality of MIAX Pearl Equities' execution and routing 
services by continuing to provide market participants with insight and 
transparency into which data feeds the Exchange utilizes when 
performing order handling, order execution, routing, and related 
compliance processes for equity securities. The Exchange also believes 
the proposal would enhance competition because it will potentially 
enhance the performance of its order handling and execution of orders 
in equity securities by receiving market data directly from IEX. 
Lastly, the proposed rule change will not impact competition between 
market participants because it will affect all market participants 
equally.

C. Self-Regulatory Organization's Statement on Comments on the Proposed 
Rule Change Received From Members, Participants, or Others

    Written comments were neither solicited nor received.

III. Date of Effectiveness of the Proposed Rule Change and Timing for 
Commission Action

    Because the foregoing proposed rule change does not: (i) 
Significantly affect the protection of investors or the public 
interest; (ii) impose any significant burden on competition; and (iii) 
become operative for 30 days after the date of the filing, or such 
shorter time as the Commission may designate, it has become effective 
pursuant to 19(b)(3)(A) of the Act \5\ and Rule 19b-4(f)(6) \6\ 
thereunder.

    \6\ 17 CFR 240.19b-4(f)(6). In addition, Rule 19b-4(f)(6) 
requires a self-regulatory organization to give the Commission 
written notice of its intent to file the proposed rule change at

The Exchange has satisfied this requirement.

change, the Commission summarily may temporarily suspend such rule 
change if it appears to the Commission that such action is necessary or

otherwise in furtherance of the purposes of the Act. If the Commission 
takes such action, the Commission shall institute proceedings to 
determine whether the proposed rule should be approved or disapproved.
