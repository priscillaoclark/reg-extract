Domestic Sugar Program--2022-Crop Cane Sugar Marketing Allotments 
and Cane and Beet Processor Allocations

AGENCY: Commodity Credit Corporation (CCC), USDA.

ACTION: Notice.

-----------------------------------------------------------------------

SUMMARY: The United States Department of Agriculture (USDA) is issuing 
this notice to revise State cane sugar allotments, revise company 
allocations to sugar beet and sugar cane processors, and reassign some 
cane sugar marketing allotment to raw cane sugar imports already 
anticipated. This applies to all domestic beet and cane sugar marketed 
for human consumption in the United States from October 1, 2021, 
through September 30, 2022.

FOR FURTHER INFORMATION CONTACT: Kent Lanclos, telephone, (202) 720-
0114; or email, <a href="/cdn-cgi/l/email-protection#503b353e247e3c313e333c3f2310252334317e373f26"><span class="__cf_email__" data-cfemail="3358565d471d5f525d505f5c4073464057521d545c45">[email&#160;protected]</span></a>. Persons with disabilities who 
require alternative means for communication should contact the USDA 
Target Center at (202) 720-2600 (voice).

SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION: On September 30, 2021, USDA announced the 
initial fiscal year 2022 (FY 2022) overall sugar marketing allotment 
quantity (OAQ), which was established at 10,370,000 short tons, raw 
value, (STRV). This was equal to 85 percent of the estimated quantity 
of sugar for domestic human consumption for FY 2022 of 12,200,000 STRV, 
as forecast in the September 2021 World Agricultural Supply and Demand 
Estimates report. The Agricultural Adjustment Act of 1938, as amended, 
requires that 54.35 percent of the OAQ be distributed among beet 
processors and 45.65 percent be distributed among the sugar cane States 
and cane processors.
    On December 22, 2021, USDA: (1) Increased the FY 2022 OAQ to 
10,802,657 STRV; (2) consequently revised the cane and beet sector 
marketing allotments, the State cane sugar marketing allotments, and 
cane and beet processor allocations according to formulas contained in 
the authorizing legislation for the Sugar Program; \1\ and (3) 
transferred allocations from beet processors with surplus allocation to 
those in need of additional allocation. USDA determined that no 
reassignment of allotments among sugar cane States and allocations 
among cane processors was necessary at that time.
---------------------------------------------------------------------------

    \1\ The authority for the Sugar Program is in 7 U.S.C. 1359aa-
1359jj, 7272, and 8110; 15 U.S.C. 714b and 714c.
---------------------------------------------------------------------------

    In accordance with section 359e of the Agricultural Adjustment Act 
of 1938, after evaluating again each sugar beet processor's ability to 
market its full allocation, USDA is transferring FY 2022 allocations 
from sugar beet processors with surplus allocation to those in need of 
additional allocation. This transfer is presented in the table below. 
USDA is not reassigning any FY 2022 beet allocations to raw cane sugar 
imports at this time, given the uncertainty of beet sugar production 
quantities from new crop sugar beets in the final 2 months (August 
through September) of FY 2022.
    USDA has also determined that domestic cane sugar supplies are 
inadequate to fill the FY 2022 cane sugar marketing allotment. In 
accordance with section 359e of the Agricultural Adjustment Act of 
1938, USDA is reassigning 600,000 STRV of this deficit to raw cane 
sugar imports already anticipated under the FY 2022 tariff-rate quotas 
(TRQ) for raw cane sugar, given the absence of any CCC stocks of sugar.

    These FY 2022 sugar marketing allotment program actions will not 
prevent any domestic sugar cane or sugar beet processor from marketing 
all its FY 2022 sugar supply. USDA will closely monitor stocks, 
consumption, imports, and all sugar market and program variables on an 
ongoing basis and may make further program adjustments during FY 2022, 
if needed.
