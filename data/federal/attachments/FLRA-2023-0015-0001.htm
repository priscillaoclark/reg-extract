FEDERAL LABOR RELATIONS AUTHORITY


Privacy Act of 1974; System of Records

AGENCY: Federal Labor Relations Authority.

ACTION: Notice of a modified system of records.

-----------------------------------------------------------------------

SUMMARY: The ``Freedom of Information Act Request and Appeal Files'' is 
the system that the Federal Labor Relations Authority (FLRA) uses to 
provide the public with a single location to submit and track Freedom 
of Information Act (FOIA) requests and appeals filed with the FLRA, to 
manage internal FOIA administration activities, and to collect data for 
annual reporting requirements to the Department of Justice. FLRA's 
prior system, FOIAOnline, was recently decommissioned. Under the 
Privacy Act of 1974, FLRA's Chief FOIA Officer proposes to update the 
system of records, titled ``Freedom of Information Act Request and 
Appeal Files,'' with information about FLRA's new FOIA system, 
FOIAXPress. This notice replaces the notice FLRA published on October 
27, 2017 at 82 FR 49813.

DATES: This notice action shall be applicable immediately, which will 
become effective January 26, 2024.
    Comments will be accepted on or before: January 26, 2024.

ADDRESSES: You may send comments, which must include the caption ``SORN 
Notice,'' by one of the following methods:
    Email: <a href="/cdn-cgi/l/email-protection#70231f1c3d11191c30161c02115e171f06"><span class="__cf_email__" data-cfemail="386b575475595154785e544a59165f574e">[email&#160;protected]</span></a>. Include ``SORN Notice'' in the subject 
line of the message.

SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION: Apart from some minor technical corrections 
and updates, the only substantive change to the prior notice relates to

shelf product, for managing FLRA's FOIA program. FOIAXPress will shift

environment.
