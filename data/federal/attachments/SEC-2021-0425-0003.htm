SECURITIES AND EXCHANGE COMMISSION

[SEC File No. 270-563, OMB Control No. 3235-0694]


Proposed Collection; Comment Request; Extension: Rule 17g-10 and 
Form ABS Due Diligence-15E

Upon Written Request, Copies Available From: Securities and Exchange 
Commission, Office of FOIA Services, 100 F Street NE, Washington, DC 
20549-2736

    Notice is hereby given that pursuant to the Paperwork Reduction Act 
of 1995 (44 U.S.C. 3501 et seq.), the Securities and Exchange 
Commission (``Commission'') is soliciting comments on the existing 
collection of information provided for in Rule 17g-10 and Form ABS Due 
Diligence-15E (17 CFR 240.17g-10 and 17 CFR 249b.500) under the 
Securities Exchange Act of 1934 (``Exchange Act'') (15 U.S.C. 78a et 
seq.). The Commission plans to submit this existing collection of 
information to the Office of Management and Budget for extension and 
approval.
    Rule 17g-10 requires a provider of third-party due diligence 
services to provide the written certification required by Section 
15E(s)(4) of the Exchange Act on Form ABS Due Diligence-15E. Based on 
Commission staff's experience, it is estimated that third-party due 
diligence service providers would be required to spend, on average, 
0.20 hours to complete and transmit Form ABS Due Diligence-15E, for a 
total annual burden of 470 hours.\1\ The cost for a compliance manager 
to complete and submit Form ABS Due Diligence-15E pursuant to Rule 17g-
10 is estimated at $372 per hour,\2\ resulting in an industry-wide 
annual internal cost to third-party service providers of $175,000 per 
year.
---------------------------------------------------------------------------

    \1\ This figure is calculated by multiplying the per year 
average number of offerings of asset-backed securities, as the term 
is defined in Section 3(a)(79) of the Exchange Act, which was 
estimated at 1,410 offerings, by the hour burden to complete and 
transmit Form ABS Due Diligence-15E, estimated at 0.20 hours (1,410 
offerings x 0.20 hours = 470 hours).
    \2\ The $372 figure for a compliance manager is based on SIFMA's 
Management & Professional Earnings in the Securities Industry 2013, 
modified by Commission staff to account for an 1,800-hour work-year 
and multiplied by 5.35 to account for bonuses, firm size, employee 
benefits and overhead, as adjusted for inflation using the Bureau of 
Labor Statistics' CPI Inflation Calculator.
---------------------------------------------------------------------------

    Written comments are invited on: (a) whether the proposed 
collection of information is necessary for the proper performance of 
the functions of the Commission, including whether the information 
shall have practical utility; (b) the accuracy of the Commission's 
estimates of the burden of the proposed collection of information; (c) 
ways to enhance the quality, utility, and clarity of the information on 
respondents; and (d) ways to minimize the burden of the collection of 
information on respondents, including through the use of automated 
collection techniques or other forms of information technology. 
Consideration will be given to comments and suggestions submitted by 
May 14, 2024.
    An agency may not conduct or sponsor, and a person is not required 
to respond to, a collection of information unless it displays a 
currently valid OMB control number. Please direct your written comments 
to: Dave Bottom, Director/Chief Information Officer, Securities and 
Exchange Commission, c/o John Pezzullo, 100 F St. NE, Washington, DC 
20549 or send an email to: <a href="/cdn-cgi/l/email-protection#d8888a998795b9b1b4bab7a098abbdbbf6bfb7ae"><span class="__cf_email__" data-cfemail="7e2e2c3f21331f17121c11063e0d1b1d50191108">[email&#160;protected]</span></a>.

    Dated: March 12, 2024.
Sherry R. Haywood,
Assistant Secretary.
