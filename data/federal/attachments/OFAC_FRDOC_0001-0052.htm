Background

    On June 28, 2005, the President, invoking the authority of, inter 
alia, the International Emergency Economic Powers Act (50 U.S.C. 1701-
1706) (``IEEPA''), issued Executive Order 13382 (70 FR 38567, July 1, 
2005) (``E.O. 13382''), effective at 12:01 a.m. eastern daylight time 
on June 29, 2005. In E.O. 13382, the President took additional steps 
with respect to the national emergency described and declared in 
Executive Order 12938 of November 14, 1994, regarding the proliferation 
of weapons of mass destruction and the means of delivering them.
    Section 1 of E.O. 13382 blocks, with certain exceptions, all 
property and interests in property that are in the United States, that 
come within the United States, or that are or come within the 
possession or control of United States persons, of: (1) The persons 
listed in an Annex to E.O. 13382; (2) any foreign person determined by 
the Secretary of State, in consultation with the Secretary of the 
Treasury, the Attorney General, and other relevant agencies, to have 
engaged, or attempted to engage, in activities or transactions that 
have materially contributed to, or pose a risk of materially 
contributing to, the proliferation of weapons of mass destruction or 
their means of delivery (including missiles capable of delivering such 
weapons), including any efforts to manufacture, acquire, possess, 
develop, transport, transfer or use such items, by any person or 
foreign country of proliferation concern; (3) any person determined by 
the Secretary of the Treasury, in consultation with the Secretary of 
State, the Attorney General, and other relevant agencies, to have 
provided, or attempted to provide, financial, material, technological 
or other support for, or goods or services in support of, any activity 
or transaction described in clause (2) above, or any person whose 
property and interests in property are blocked pursuant to E.O. 13382; 
and (4) any person determined by the Secretary of the Treasury, in 
consultation with the Secretary of State, the Attorney General, and 
other relevant agencies, to be owned or controlled by, or acting or 
purporting to act for or on behalf of, directly or indirectly, any 
person whose property and interests in property are blocked pursuant to 
E.O. 13382.
    Section 1 of E.O. 13382 further provides that the prohibition on 
any transaction or dealing by a United States person or within the 
United States in blocked property or interests in property includes, 
but is not limited to, the making of any contribution or provision of 
funds, goods, or services by, to, or for the benefit of, any person 
whose property and interests in property are blocked pursuant to E.O. 
13382, and the receipt of any contribution or provision of funds, 
goods, or services from any such person. Section 1 of E.O. 13382 
further prohibits any transaction by a United States person or within 
the United States that evades or avoids, or has the purpose of evading 
or avoiding, or attempts to violate any of the prohibitions set forth 
in E.O. 13382, as well as any conspiracy formed to violate such 
prohibitions.
    In Section 3 of E.O. 13382, the President determined that the 
making of donations of certain articles, such as food, clothing, and 
medicine intended to relieve human suffering, as specified in section 
203(b)(2) of IEEPA (50 U.S.C. 1702(b)(2)), by, to, or for the benefit 
of any person whose property and interests in property are blocked 
pursuant to E.O. 13382 would seriously impair his ability to deal with 
the national emergency declared in Executive Order 12938, and the 
President therefore prohibited such donations. Accordingly, the 
donation of such items is prohibited unless authorized by OFAC.
    Section 6 of E.O. 13382 authorizes the Secretary of the Treasury, 
in consultation with the Secretary of State, to take such actions, 
including the promulgation of rules and regulations, as may be 
necessary to carry out the purposes of E.O. 13382. In furtherance of 
those purposes, OFAC is promulgating the Weapons of Mass Destruction 
Proliferators Sanctions Regulations, 31 CFR part 544 (the 
``Regulations'').
    Subpart A of the Regulations, which discusses the relation of the 
Regulations to other economic sanctions programs, includes a Note to 
Sec.  544.101 clarifying that the sanctions implemented pursuant to the 
Weapons of Mass Destruction Trade Control Regulations set forth in 31 
CFR part 539 are separate and distinct from the sanctions implemented 
pursuant to these Regulations, even though both programs are based on 
the same declaration of national emergency in Executive Order 12938 of 
November 14, 1994. Accordingly, a ``designated foreign person'' whose 
goods, technology, or services are prohibited from being imported into 
the United States under the Weapons of Mass Destruction Trade Control 
Regulations is not necessarily a person whose property and interests in 
property are blocked pursuant to these Regulations. Consequently, the 
property and interests in property of a ``designated foreign person'' 
under the Weapons of Mass Destruction Trade Control Regulations are not 
necessarily blocked by these Regulations, unless the ``designated 
foreign person'' has separately become a person whose property and 
interests in property are blocked pursuant to these Regulations. 
However, the importation into the United States of goods, technology, 
or services (other than information or informational materials) 
produced or provided by a ``designated foreign person'' under the 
Weapons of Mass Destruction Trade Control Regulations remains 
prohibited. To help the public distinguish between these two programs, 
persons designated by the Secretary of State under the Weapons of Mass 
Destruction Trade Control Regulations are listed in a separate appendix 
to part 539 and are not listed on OFAC's Specially Designated Nationals 
and Blocked Persons List (``SDN list''), which is accessible via OFAC's 
Web site and can be found at Appendix A to 31 CFR chapter V. Persons 
whose property and interests in property are blocked under these 
Regulations are listed on OFAC's SDN list with the identifier 
``[NPWMD].''
    Subpart B of the Regulations implements the prohibitions contained 
in Section 1 of E.O. 13382. See, e.g., Sec. Sec.  544.201 and 544.205. 
Persons identified in the Annex to E.O. 13382, designated by the 
Secretary of State or the Secretary of the Treasury pursuant to E.O. 
13382, or otherwise subject to the blocking provisions of E.O. 13382 
are referred to throughout the Regulations as ``persons whose property 
and interests in property are blocked pursuant to Sec.  544.201(a).'' 
The names of persons listed in or designated pursuant to E.O. 13382 are 
or will be published on OFAC's SDN list. Those names also have been or 
will be published in the Federal Register.
    Sections 544.202 and 544.203 of subpart B detail the effect of 
transfers of blocked property in violation of the Regulations and set 
forth the requirement to hold blocked funds, such as currency, bank 
deposits, and liquidated financial obligations, in interest-bearing 
blocked accounts. Section 544.204 of subpart B provides that all 
expenses incident to the maintenance of blocked physical property shall 
be the responsibility of the owners or operators of such property and 
that such expenses shall not be met from blocked funds, unless 
otherwise authorized. The section further provides that blocked 
property may, in OFAC's discretion, be sold or liquidated and the net 
proceeds placed in a blocked interest-bearing account in the name of 
the owner of the property.

[[Page 16773]]

    Section 544.205 implements the prohibitions of E.O. 13382 on any 
transaction by a United States person or within the United States that 
evades or avoids, has the purpose of evading or avoiding, or attempts 
to violate any of the prohibitions set forth in E.O. 13382, and on any 
conspiracy formed to violate such prohibitions.
    Section 544.206 of subpart B details transactions that are exempt 
from the prohibitions of part 544 pursuant to sections 203(b)(1), (3), 
and (4) of IEEPA (50 U.S.C. 1702(b)(1), (3), and (4)). These exemptions 
relate to personal communications, the importation and exportation of 
information or informational materials, and transactions ordinarily 
incident to travel. The President determined in Section 3 of E.O. 13382 
that donations of the type of articles specified in Sec. 203(b)(2) of 
IEEPA (50 U.S.C. 1702(b)(2)), i.e., articles such as food, clothing, 
and medicine intended to relieve human suffering, by, to, or for the 
benefit of any person whose property and interests in property are 
blocked would seriously impair the President's ability to deal with the 
declared national emergency. Accordingly, such donations are not 
exempted from these Regulations and are prohibited, unless authorized 
by OFAC.
    Subpart C of part 544 defines key terms used throughout the 
Regulations, and subpart D sets forth interpretive sections regarding 
the general prohibitions contained in subpart B. Section 544.411 sets 
out the rule that the property and interests in property of an entity 
are blocked if the entity is 50 percent or more owned by a person whose 
property and interests in property are blocked, whether or not the 
entity itself is named in the Annex to E.O. 13382 or designated by the 
Secretary of State or OFAC.
    Transactions otherwise prohibited under part 544 but found to be 
consistent with U.S. policy may be authorized by one of the general 
licenses contained in subpart E or by a specific license issued 
pursuant to the procedures described in subpart E of part 501 of 31 CFR 
chapter V. In addition to the general licenses, subpart E of part 544 
also contains certain statements of licensing policy.
    Subpart F of part 544 refers to subpart C of part 501 for 
applicable recordkeeping and reporting requirements. Subpart G 
describes the civil and criminal penalties applicable to violations of 
the Regulations, as well as the procedures governing the potential 
imposition of a civil monetary penalty. Subpart G also refers to 
Appendix A of part 501 for a more complete description of these 
procedures.
    Subpart H of part 544 refers to subpart E of part 501 for 
applicable provisions relating to administrative procedures and 
memorializes a delegation of authority by the Secretary of the 
Treasury. Subpart I of the Regulations sets forth a Paperwork Reduction 
Act notice.

Public Participation

    Because the Regulations involve a foreign affairs function, the 
provisions of Executive Order 12866 and the Administrative Procedure 
Act (5 U.S.C. 553) requiring notice of proposed rulemaking, opportunity 
for public participation, and delay in effective date are inapplicable. 
Because no notice of proposed rulemaking is required for this rule, the 
Regulatory Flexibility Act (5 U.S.C. 601-612) does not apply.

Paperwork Reduction Act

    The collections of information related to the Regulations are 
contained in 31 CFR part 501 (the ``Reporting, Procedures and Penalties 
Regulations''). Pursuant to the Paperwork Reduction Act of 1995 (44 
U.S.C. 3507), those collections of information have been approved by 
the Office of Management and Budget under control number 1505-0164. An 
agency may not conduct or sponsor, and a person is not required to 
respond to, a collection of information unless the collection of 
information displays a valid control number.

List of Subjects in 31 CFR Part 544

    Administrative practice and procedure, Banks, Banking, Blocking of 
assets, Credit, Foreign trade, Penalties, Proliferation, Reporting and 
recordkeeping requirements, Securities, Services, Weapons of mass 
destruction.

Subpart A--Relation of This Part to Other Laws and Regulations


Sec.  544.101  Relation of this part to other laws and regulations.

    This part is separate from, and independent of, the other parts of 
this chapter, with the exception of part 501 of this chapter, the 
recordkeeping and reporting requirements and license application and 
other procedures of which apply to this part. Actions taken pursuant to 
part 501 of this chapter with respect to the prohibitions contained in 
this part are considered actions taken pursuant to this part. Differing 
foreign policy and national security circumstances may result in 
differing interpretations of similar language among the parts of this 
chapter. No license or authorization contained in or issued pursuant to 
those other parts authorizes any transaction prohibited by this part. 
No license or authorization contained in or issued pursuant to any 
other provision of law or regulation authorizes any transaction 
prohibited by this part. No license or authorization contained in or 
issued pursuant to this part relieves the involved parties from 
complying with any other applicable laws or regulations.

    Note to Sec.  544.101:  The sanctions implemented pursuant to 
the Weapons of Mass Destruction Trade Control Regulations set forth 
in part 539 of this chapter are separate and distinct from the 
sanctions implemented pursuant to this part, even though both 
programs have been imposed pursuant to the same declaration of 
national emergency in Executive Order 12938 of November 14, 1994. 
Accordingly, a ``designated foreign person'' whose goods, 
technology, or services are prohibited from being imported into the 
United States under part 539 is not necessarily a person whose 
property and interests in property are blocked pursuant to Sec.  
544.201(a). Consequently, the property and interests in property of 
a ``designated foreign person'' under part 539 are not blocked, 
unless the ``designated foreign person'' has separately become a 
person whose property and interests in property are blocked pursuant 
to Sec.  544.201(a) or any other part of 31 CFR chapter V. Note, 
however, that the importation into the United States of goods, 
technology, or services (other than information or informational 
materials) produced or provided by a ``designated foreign person'' 
under part 539 is prohibited by that part.

Subpart B--Prohibitions


Sec.  544.201  Prohibited transactions involving blocked property.

    (a) Except as authorized by regulations, orders, directives, 
rulings, instructions, licenses or otherwise, and notwithstanding any 
contracts entered into or any license or permit granted prior to the 
effective date, all property and interests in property that are in the 
United States, that hereafter come within the United States, or that 
are or hereafter come within the possession or control of U.S. persons, 
including their overseas branches, of the following persons are blocked 
and may not be transferred, paid, exported, withdrawn, or otherwise 
dealt in:
    (1) Any person listed in the Annex to Executive Order 13382 of June 
28, 2005 (70 FR 38567, July 1, 2005);
    (2) Any foreign person determined by the Secretary of State, in 
consultation with the Secretary of the Treasury, the Attorney General, 
and other relevant agencies, to have engaged, or attempted to engage, 
in activities or transactions that have materially contributed to, or 
pose a risk of materially contributing to, the proliferation of weapons 
of mass destruction or their means of delivery (including missiles 
capable of delivering such weapons), including any efforts to 
manufacture, acquire, possess, develop, transport, transfer or use such 
items, by any person or foreign country of proliferation concern;
    (3) Any person determined by the Secretary of the Treasury, in 
consultation with the Secretary of State, the Attorney General, and 
other relevant agencies, to have provided, or attempted to provide, 
financial, material, technological or other support for, or goods or 
services in support of, any activity or transaction described in 
paragraph (a)(2) of this section, or any person whose property and 
interests in property are blocked pursuant to this section; and
    (4) Any person determined by the Secretary of the Treasury, in 
consultation with the Secretary of State, the Attorney General, and 
other relevant agencies, to be owned or controlled by, or acting or 
purporting to act for or on behalf of, directly or indirectly, any 
person whose property and interests in property are blocked pursuant to 
this section.

    Note to paragraph (a) of Sec.  544.201:  1. The names of persons 
listed in or designated pursuant to Executive Order 13382, whose 
property and interests in property are blocked pursuant to paragraph 
(a) of this section, are published on the Office of Foreign Assets 
Control's Specially Designated Nationals and Blocked Persons List 
(``SDN'' list) (which is accessible via the Office of Foreign Assets 
Control's Web site), published in the Federal Register, and 
incorporated into Appendix A to this chapter with the identifier 
``[NPWMD].'' See Sec.  544.411 concerning entities that may not be 
listed on the SDN list but whose property and interests in property 
are nevertheless blocked pursuant to paragraph (a) of this section.
    2. Section 203 of the International Emergency Economic Powers 
Act (50 U.S.C. 1701-1706) (``IEEPA'') explicitly authorizes the 
blocking of property and interests in property of a person during 
the pendency of an investigation. The names of persons whose 
property and interests in property are blocked pending investigation 
pursuant to this part also are published on the SDN list, published 
in the Federal Register, and incorporated into Appendix A to this 
chapter with the identifier ``[BPI-NPWMD].''
    3. Sections 501.806 and 501.807 of this chapter describe the 
procedures to be followed by persons seeking, respectively, the 
unblocking of funds that they believe were blocked due to mistaken 
identity, or administrative reconsideration of their status as 
persons whose property and interests in Property are blocked 
pursuant to paragraph (a) of this section.

    (b) The prohibitions in paragraph (a) of this section include, but 
are not limited to, prohibitions on the following transactions when 
engaged in by a United States person or within the United States:
    (1) The making of any contribution or provision of funds, goods, or 
services by, to, or for the benefit of any person whose property and 
interests in property are blocked pursuant to paragraph (a) of this 
section; and
    (2) The receipt of any contribution or provision of funds, goods, 
or services from any person whose property and interests in property 
are blocked pursuant to paragraph (a) of this section.
    (c) Unless otherwise authorized by this part or by a specific 
license expressly referring to this section, any dealing in any 
security (or evidence thereof) held within the possession or control of 
a U.S. person and either registered or inscribed in the name of, or 
known to be held for the benefit of, or issued by, any person whose 
property and interests in property are blocked pursuant to paragraph 
(a) of this section is prohibited. This prohibition includes but is not 
limited to the transfer (including the transfer on the books of any 
issuer or agent thereof), disposition, transportation, importation, 
exportation, or withdrawal of, or the endorsement or guaranty of 
signatures on, any such security on or after the effective date. This 
prohibition applies irrespective of the fact that at any time (whether 
prior to, on, or subsequent to the effective date) the registered or 
inscribed owner

[[Page 16775]]

of any such security may have or might appear to have assigned, 
transferred, or otherwise disposed of the security.


Sec.  544.202  Effect of transfers violating the provisions of this 
part.

    (a) Any transfer after the effective date that is in violation of 
any provision of this part or of any regulation, order, directive, 
ruling, instruction, or license issued pursuant to this part, and that 
involves any property or interest in property blocked pursuant to Sec.  
544.201(a), is null and void and shall not be the basis for the 
assertion or recognition of any interest in or right, remedy, power, or 
privilege with respect to such property or property interests.
    (b) No transfer before the effective date shall be the basis for 
the assertion or recognition of any right, remedy, power, or privilege 
with respect to, or any interest in, any property or interest in 
property blocked pursuant to Sec.  544.201(a), unless the person who 
holds or maintains such property, prior to that date, had written 
notice of the transfer or by any written evidence had recognized such 
transfer.
    (c) Unless otherwise provided, an appropriate license or other 
authorization issued by or pursuant to the direction or authorization 
of the Director of the Office of Foreign Assets Control before, during, 
or after a transfer shall validate such transfer or make it enforceable 
to the same extent that it would be valid or enforceable but for the 
provisions of IEEPA, Executive Order 13382, this part, and any 
regulation, order, directive, ruling, instruction, or license issued 
pursuant to this part.
    (d) Transfers of property that otherwise would be null and void or 
unenforceable by virtue of the provisions of this section shall not be 
deemed to be null and void or unenforceable as to any person with whom 
such property is or was held or maintained (and as to such person only) 
in cases in which such person is able to establish to the satisfaction 
of the Director of the Office of Foreign Assets Control each of the 
following:
    (1) Such transfer did not represent a willful violation of the 
provisions of this part by the person with whom such property is or was 
held or maintained (and as to such person only);
    (2) The person with whom such property is or was held or maintained 
did not have reasonable cause to know or suspect, in view of all the 
facts and circumstances known or available to such person, that such 
transfer required a license or authorization issued pursuant to this 
part and was not so licensed or authorized, or, if a license or 
authorization did purport to cover the transfer, that such license or 
authorization had been obtained by misrepresentation of a third party 
or withholding of material facts or was otherwise fraudulently 
obtained; and
    (3) The person with whom such property is or was held or maintained 
filed with the Office of Foreign Assets Control a report setting forth 
in full the circumstances relating to such transfer promptly upon 
discovery that:
    (i) Such transfer was in violation of the provisions of this part 
or any regulation, ruling, instruction, license, or other directive or 
authorization issued pursuant to this part;
    (ii) Such transfer was not licensed or authorized by the Director 
of the Office of Foreign Assets Control; or
    (iii) If a license did purport to cover the transfer, such license 
had been obtained by misrepresentation of a third party or withholding 
of material facts or was otherwise fraudulently obtained.

    Note to paragraph (d) of Sec.  544.202: The filing of a report 
in accordance with the provisions of paragraph (d)(3) of this

sell or liquidate such property. However, the Office of Foreign Assets 
Control may issue licenses permitting or directing such sales or 
liquidation in appropriate cases.

reinvested in a manner that provides immediate financial or economic 
benefit or access to any person whose property and interests in 
property are blocked pursuant to Sec.  544.201(a), nor may their holder 
cooperate in or facilitate the pledging or other attempted use as 
collateral of blocked funds or other assets.

    Any transaction ordinarily incident to a licensed transaction and 
necessary to give effect thereto is also authorized, except:

authorization.
    (b) No regulation, ruling, instruction, or license authorizes any 
transaction prohibited under this part unless the regulation, ruling, 
instruction or license is issued by the Office of Foreign Assets 
Control and specifically refers to this part. No regulation, ruling, 
instruction, or license referring to this part shall be deemed to 
authorize any transaction prohibited by any other provision of this 
chapter unless the regulation, ruling, instruction, or license 
specifically refers to such provision.
    (c) Any regulation, ruling, instruction, or license authorizing any 
transaction otherwise prohibited under this part has the effect of 
removing a prohibition contained in this part from the transaction, but 
only to the extent specifically stated by its terms. Unless the 
regulation, ruling, instruction, or license otherwise specifies, such 
an authorization does not create any right, duty, obligation, claim, or 
interest in, or with respect to, any property that would not otherwise 
exist under ordinary principles of law.


Sec.  544.503  Exclusion from licenses.

    The Director of the Office of Foreign Assets Control reserves the

the United States for this purpose;
    (b) The proceeds of such investments and reinvestments shall not be 
credited to a blocked account or subaccount under any name or 
designation that differs from the name or designation of the specific

pursuant to this part or otherwise under IEEPA.
    (1) A civil penalty not to exceed the amount set forth in section 
206 of IEEPA may be imposed on any person who violates, attempts to 
violate, conspires to violate, or causes a violation of any license, 
order, regulation, or prohibition issued under IEEPA.

    Note to paragraph (a)(1) of Sec.  544.701:  As of the date of 
publication in the Federal Register of the final rule adding this 
part to 31 CFR chapter V (April 13, 2009), IEEPA provides for a 
maximum civil penalty not to exceed the greater of $250,000 or an 
amount that is twice the amount of the transaction that is the basis 
of the violation with respect to which the penalty is imposed.

    (2) A person who willfully commits, willfully attempts to commit, 
or willfully conspires to commit, or aids or abets in the commission of 
a violation of any license, order, regulation, or prohibition may, upon 
conviction, be fined not more than $1,000,000, or if a natural person, 
be imprisoned for not more than 20 years, or both.
    (b) Adjustments to penalty amounts. (1) The civil penalties 
provided in IEEPA are subject to adjustment pursuant to the Federal 
Civil Penalties Inflation Adjustment Act of 1990 (Pub. L. 101-410, as

Sec.  544.702  Pre-Penalty Notice; settlement.

    (a) When required. If the Office of Foreign Assets Control has 
reason to believe that there has occurred a violation of any provision 
of this part or a violation of the provisions of any license, ruling, 
regulation, order, direction, or instruction issued by or pursuant to 
the direction or authorization of the Secretary of the Treasury 
pursuant to this part or otherwise under IEEPA and determines that a 
civil monetary penalty is warranted, the Office of Foreign Assets 
Control will issue a Pre-Penalty Notice informing the alleged violator 
of the agency's intent to impose a monetary penalty. A Pre-Penalty 
Notice shall be in writing. The Pre-Penalty Notice may be issued 
whether or not another agency has taken any action with respect to the 
matter. For a description of the contents of a Pre-Penalty Notice, see 
Appendix A to part 501 of this chapter.
    (b)(1) Right to respond. An alleged violator has the right to 
respond to a Pre-Penalty Notice by making a written presentation to the 
Office of Foreign Assets Control. For a description of the information 
that should be included in such a response, see Appendix A to part 501 
of this chapter.
    (2) Deadline for response. A response to a Pre-Penalty Notice must 
be made within the applicable 30-day period set forth in this 
paragraph. The failure to submit a response within the applicable time 
period set forth in this paragraph shall be deemed to be a waiver of 
the right to respond.
    (i) Computation of time for response. A response to a Pre-Penalty 
Notice must be postmarked or date-stamped by the U.S. Postal Service 
(or foreign postal service, if mailed abroad) or courier service 
provider (if transmitted to the Office of Foreign Assets Control by 
courier) on or before the 30th day after the postmark date on the 
envelope in which the Pre-Penalty Notice was mailed. If the Pre-Penalty 
Notice was personally delivered by a non-U.S. Postal Service agent 
authorized by the Office of Foreign Assets Control, a response must be 
postmarked or date-stamped on or before the 30th day after the date of 
delivery.
    (ii) Extensions of time for response. If a due date falls on a 
federal holiday or weekend, that due date is extended to include the 
following business day. Any other extensions of time will be granted, 
at the discretion of the Office of Foreign Assets Control, only upon 
specific request to the Office of Foreign Assets Control.
    (3) Form and method of response. A response to a Pre-Penalty Notice 
need not be in any particular form, but it must be typewritten and 
signed by the alleged violator or a representative thereof, must 
contain information sufficient to indicate that it is in response to 
the Pre-Penalty Notice, and must include the Office of Foreign Assets 
Control identification number listed on the Pre-Penalty Notice. A copy 
of the written response may be sent by facsimile, but the original also 
must be sent to the Office of Foreign Assets Control Civil Penalties 
Division by mail or courier and must be postmarked or date-stamped in 
accordance with paragraph (b)(2) of this section.
    (c) Settlement. Settlement discussion may be initiated by the 
Office of Foreign Assets Control, the alleged violator, or the alleged 
violator's authorized representative. For a description of practices 
with respect to settlement, see Appendix A to part 501 of this chapter.
    (d) Guidelines. Guidelines for the imposition or settlement of 
civil penalties by the Office of Foreign Assets Control are contained 
in Appendix A to part 501 of this chapter.
    (e) Representation. A representative of the alleged violator may 
act on behalf of the alleged violator, but any oral communication with 
the Office of Foreign Assets Control prior to a written submission 
regarding the specific allegations contained in the Pre-Penalty Notice 
must be preceded by a written letter of representation, unless the Pre-
Penalty Notice was served upon the alleged violator in care of the 
representative.


Sec.  544.703  Penalty imposition.

    If, after considering any written response to the Pre-Penalty 
Notice and any relevant facts, the Office of Foreign Assets Control 
determines that there was a violation by the alleged violator named in 
the Pre-Penalty Notice and that a civil monetary penalty is 
appropriate, the Office of Foreign Assets Control may issue a Penalty 
Notice to the violator containing a determination of the violation and 
the imposition of the monetary penalty. For additional details 
concerning issuance of a Penalty Notice, see Appendix A to part 501 of 
this chapter. The issuance of the Penalty Notice shall constitute final 
agency action. The violator has the right to seek judicial review of 
that final agency action in federal district court.


Sec.  544.704  Administrative collection; referral to United States 
Department of Justice.

    In the event that the violator does not pay the penalty imposed 
pursuant to this part or make payment arrangements acceptable to the 
Director of the Office of Foreign Assets Control, the matter may be 
referred for administrative collection measures by the Department of 
the Treasury or to the United States Department of Justice for 
appropriate action to recover the penalty in a civil suit in a federal 
district court.
