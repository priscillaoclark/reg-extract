2. Amend Sec.  102.66 by revising paragraph (d) to read as follows:


Sec.  102.66  Introduction of evidence: rights of parties at hearing; 
preclusion; subpoenas; oral argument and briefs.

* * * * *
    (d) Preclusion. A party shall be precluded from raising any issue, 
presenting any evidence relating to any issue, cross-examining any 
witness concerning any issue, and presenting argument concerning any 
issue that the party failed to raise in its timely Statement of 
Position or to place in dispute in response to another party's 
Statement of Position or response, except that no party shall be 
precluded from contesting or presenting evidence relevant to the 
Board's statutory jurisdiction to process the petition. Nor shall any 
party be precluded, on the grounds that a voter's eligibility or 
inclusion was not contested at the pre-election hearing, from 
challenging the eligibility of any voter during the election. If a 
party contends that the proposed unit is not appropriate in its 
Statement of Position but fails to specify the classifications, 
locations, or other employee groupings that must be added to or 
excluded from the proposed unit to make it an appropriate unit, the 
party shall also be precluded from raising any issue as to the 
appropriateness of the unit, presenting any evidence relating to the 
appropriateness of the unit, cross-examining any witness concerning the 
appropriateness of the unit, and presenting argument concerning the 
appropriateness of the unit. If the employer fails to timely furnish 
the lists of employees described in Sec.  102.63(b)(1)(i)(C), 
(b)(2)(iii), or (b)(3)(i)(D), the employer shall be precluded from 
contesting the appropriateness of the proposed unit at any time and 
from contesting the eligibility or inclusion of any individuals at the 
pre-election hearing, including by presenting evidence or argument, or 
by cross-examination of witnesses.
