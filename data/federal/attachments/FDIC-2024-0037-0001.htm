    General Description of Collection: Section 7(j) of the FDIA (12 
U.S.C. 1817(j)) and sections 303.80-88 of the FDIC Rules and 
Regulations (12 CFR 303.80 et seq.) require that any person proposing 
to acquire control of an insured depository institution and certain 
parent companies thereof provide 60 days prior written notice of the 
proposed acquisition to the appropriate federal banking agency. Such 
written notice which pertains to the acquisition of control of an FDIC 
supervised institution and certain parent companies thereof is filed 
with the regional director of the FDIC region in which the bank is 
located. The FDIC reviews the information reported in the Notice to 
assess, in part, any anticompetitive and monopolistic effects of the 
proposed acquisition, to determine if the financial condition of any 
acquiring person or the future prospects of the institution might 
jeopardize the financial stability of the institution or prejudice the 
interests of the depositors of the institution, and to determine 
whether the competence, experience, or integrity of any acquiring 
person, or of any of the proposed management personnel, indicates that 
it would not be in the interest of the depositors of the institution, 
or in the interest of the public, to permit such persons to control the 
bank. The FDIC must also make an independent determination of the 
accuracy and completeness of all of the information required to be 
filed in conjunction with a Notice.
    The FDIC is increasing the total burden associated with this 
collection from 549 hours to 854 hours. This information collection 
contains a disclosure requirement, which was not recognized in the 2021 
submission. The 305 increase in burden hours is due to the addition of 
the disclosure requirement and the use of a more accurate methodology 
to estimate the number of respondents and responses per respondent.

Request for Comment

    Comments are invited on: (a) Whether the collections of information 
are necessary for the proper performance of the FDIC's functions, 
including whether the information has practical utility; (b) the 
accuracy of the estimates of the burden of the information collections, 
including the validity of the methodology and assumptions used; (c) 
ways to enhance the quality, utility, and clarity of the information to 
be collected; and (d) ways to minimize the burden of the collections of 
information on respondents, including through the use of automated 
collection techniques or other forms of information technology. All 
comments will become a matter of public record.

Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation.

    By order of the Board of Directors.

    Dated at Washington, DC, April 26, 2024.
James P. Sheesley,
Assistant Executive Secretary.
