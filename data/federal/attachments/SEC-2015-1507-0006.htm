SECURITIES AND EXCHANGE COMMISSION

[SEC File No. 270-442, OMB Control No. 3235-0498]


Submission for OMB Review; Comment Request; Extension: Rule 17a-
12

Upon Written Request, Copies Available From: Securities and Exchange 
Commission, Office of FOIA Services, 100 F Street NE, Washington, DC 
20549-2736

    Notice is hereby given that pursuant to the Paperwork Reduction Act 
of 1995 (``PRA'') (44 U.S.C. 3501 et seq.), the Securities and Exchange 
Commission (``Commission'') has submitted to the Office of Management 
and Budget (``OMB'') a request for approval of extension of the 
previously approved collection of information provided for in Rule 17a-
12 (17 CFR 240.17a-12) and Part II of Form X-17A-5 (17 CFR 249.617) 
under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 (15 U.S.C. 78a et seq.).
    Rule 17a-12 is the reporting rule tailored specifically for over-
the-counter (``OTC'') derivatives dealers registered with the 
Commission, and Part II of Form X-17A-5, the Financial and Operational 
Combined Uniform Single (``FOCUS'') Report, is the basic document for 
reporting the financial and operational condition of OTC derivatives 
dealers. Rule 17a-12 requires registered OTC derivatives dealers to 
file Part II of the FOCUS Report quarterly. Rule 17a-12 also requires 
that OTC derivatives dealers file audited reports annually.
    The reports required under Rule 17a-12 provide the Commission with 
information used to monitor the operations of OTC derivatives dealers 
and to enforce their compliance with the Commission's rules. These 
reports also enable the Commission to review the business activities of 
OTC derivatives dealers and to anticipate, where possible, how these 
dealers may be affected by significant economic events.
    The Commission estimates that the total hour burden under Rule 17a-
12 is approximately 540 hours per year, and the total cost burden is 
approximately $138,900 per year.
    The retention period for the recordkeeping requirement under Rule 
17a-12 is not less than two years following the date the notice is 
submitted. The recordkeeping requirement under this rule is mandatory 
to assist the Commission in monitoring OTC derivatives dealers. This 
rule does not involve the collection of confidential information.
    An agency may not conduct or sponsor, and a person is not required 
to respond to, a collection of information under the PRA unless it 
displays a currently valid OMB control number.
