EXPORT-IMPORT BANK

[Public Notice 2021-3004]


Agency Information Collection Activities: Comment Request

AGENCY: Export-Import Bank of the United States.

[[Page 10790]]


ACTION:  Submission for OMB review and comments request.

-----------------------------------------------------------------------

SUMMARY: The Export-Import Bank of the United States (EXIM), as a part 
of its continuing effort to reduce paperwork and respondent burden, 
invites the general public and other Federal Agencies to comment on the 
proposed information collection, as required by the Paperwork Reduction 
Act of 1995. EXIM's financial institution policy holders provide this 
form to U.S. exporters, who certify to the eligibility of their exports 
for EXIM support. The completed forms are held by the financial 
institution policy holders, only to be submitted to EXIM in the event 
of a claim filing. A requirement of EXIM's policies is that the insured 
financial institution policy holder obtains a completed Exporter's 
Certificate at the time it provides financing for an export. This form 
will enable EXIM to identify the specific details of the export 
transaction. These details are necessary for determining the 
eligibility of claims for approval. EXIM staff and contractors review 
this information to assist in determining that an export transaction, 
on which a claim for non-payment has been submitted, meets all of the 
terms and conditions of the insurance coverage.

DATES: Comments must be received on or before March 28, 2022 to be 
assured of consideration.

ADDRESSES: Comments may be submitted electronically on 
<a href="http://www.regulations.gov">www.regulations.gov</a> or by mail to Jean Fitzgibbon,
