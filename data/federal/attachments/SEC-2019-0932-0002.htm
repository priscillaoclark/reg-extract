SECURITIES AND EXCHANGE COMMISSION

[SEC File No. 270-656, OMB Control No. 3235-0715]


Proposed Collection; Comment Request; Extension: Rule 3a71-6

    Upon Written Request, Copies Available From: Securities and 
Exchange Commission, Office of FOIA Services, 100 F Street NE, 
Washington, DC 20549-2736

    Notice is hereby given that pursuant to the Paperwork Reduction Act 
of 1995 (``PRA'') (44 U.S.C. 3501 et seq.), the Securities and Exchange 
Commission (``Commission'') is soliciting comments on the existing 
collection of information provided for in Rule 3a71-6 (17 CFR 240.3a71-
6), under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 (15 U.S.C. 78a et seq.). 
The Commission plans to submit this existing collection of information 
to the Office of Management and Budget (``OMB'') for extension and 
approval.

[[Page 45930]]

    Rule 3a71-6 provides that non-U.S. security-based swap dealers and 
major security-based swap participants may comply with certain Exchange 
Act requirements via compliance with requirements of a foreign 
financial regulatory system that the Commission has determined by order 
to be comparable to those Exchange Act requirements, taking into 
account the scope and objectives of the relevant foreign requirements, 
and the effectiveness of supervision and enforcement under the foreign 
regulatory regime.
    Requests for substituted compliance may come from parties or groups 
of parties that may rely on substituted compliance, or from foreign 
financial authorities supervising such parties or their security-based 
swap activities. In practice, the Commission continues to expect that 
the greater portion of any such substituted compliance requests will be 
submitted by foreign financial authorities. For purposes of the PRA, 
the Commission continues to estimate that three security-based swap 
dealers or major security-based swap participants will submit 
substituted compliance applications.
    The Commission staff estimates that the total annual time burden 
associated with Rule 3a71-6 is 240 hours per year and the total annual 
cost burden associated with Rule 3a71-6 is $350,400 per year.
    Written comments are invited on: (a) whether the proposed 
collection of information is necessary for the proper performance of 
the functions of the Commission, including whether the information 
shall have practical utility; (b) the accuracy of the Commission's 
estimates of the burden of the proposed collection of information; (c) 
ways to enhance the quality, utility, and clarity of the information 
collected; and (d) ways to minimize the burden of the collection of 
information on respondents, including through the use of automated 
collection techniques or other forms of information technology. 
Consideration will be given to comments and suggestions submitted by 
July 23, 2024.
    An agency may not conduct or sponsor, and a person is not required 
to respond to, a collection of information under the PRA unless it 
displays a currently valid OMB control number.
    Please direct your written comments to: David Bottom, Director/
Chief Information Officer, Securities and Exchange Commission, c/o John 
Pezzullo, 100 F Street NE, Washington, DC 20549, or send an email to:

Assistant Secretary.
