FEDERAL RESERVE SYSTEM

[Docket No. OP-1822]


Federal Reserve Bank Services

AGENCY: Board of Governors of the Federal Reserve System.

ACTION: Notification of 2024 private sector adjustment factor and fee 
schedules.

-----------------------------------------------------------------------

SUMMARY: The Board of Governors of the Federal Reserve System (Board) 
has approved the private-sector adjustment factor (PSAF) for 2024 of 
$29.2 million and the 2024 fee schedules for Federal Reserve priced 
services and electronic access. These actions were taken in accordance 
with the Monetary Control Act of 1980, which requires that, over the 
long run, fees for Federal Reserve priced services be established based 
on all direct and indirect costs, including the PSAF.

DATES: The new fee schedules become effective January 2, 2024.

FOR FURTHER INFORMATION CONTACT: For questions regarding the fee 
schedules: Ian Spear, Assistant Director, (202) 452-3959; Larkin 
Turman, Senior Financial Institution Policy Analyst, (202) 657-9306; 
Division of Reserve Bank Operations and Payment Systems. For questions 
regarding the PSAF: Rebecca Royer, Associate Director, (202) 736-5662; 
Kelsey Cassidy, Financial Institution Policy Analyst, (202) 465-6817; 
Division of Reserve Bank Operations and Payment Systems. For users of 
TTY-TRS, please call 711 from any telephone, anywhere in the United 
States. Copies of the 2024 fee schedules for the check services are 
available from the Board, the Federal Reserve Banks, or the Federal 
Reserve Financial Services (FRFS) website at <a href="http://www.FRBservices.org">www.FRBservices.org</a>.

SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION:

I. Private-Sector Adjustment Factor, Priced Services Cost Recovery, and 
Overview of 2024 Price Changes

    A. Overview--Each year, as required by the Monetary Control Act 
(MCA) of 1980, the Reserve Banks set fees for priced services provided 
to financial institutions. These fees are set to recover, over the long 
run, all direct and indirect costs and imputed costs, including 
financing costs, taxes, and certain other expenses, as well as the 
return on equity (profit) that would have been earned if a private-
sector business provided the services.\1\ The imputed costs and imputed 
profit are collectively referred to as the private-sector adjustment 
factor (PSAF).
---------------------------------------------------------------------------

    \1\ Although the Monetary Control Act does not define ``over the 
long run,'' the Board has generally measured long-run cost recovery 
for mature services to be over a 10-year rolling time frame. The 
Board currently views a 10-year cost recovery expectation as 
appropriate for assessing mature services, which are those that have 
achieved a critical mass of customer participation and generally 
have stable and predictable volumes, costs, and revenues. The 10-
year recovery rate is based on the pro forma income statements for 
Federal Reserve priced services published in the Board's Annual 
Report. In accordance with Accounting Standards Codification (ASC) 
715 Compensation--Retirement Benefits, the Reserve Banks recognized 
a $590.0 million cumulative reduction in equity related to the 
priced services' benefit plans through 2022. Including this 
cumulative reduction in equity from 2013 to 2022 results in cost 
recovery of 103.8 percent for the 10-year period. This measure of 
long-run cost recovery is also published in the Board's Annual 
Report.
---------------------------------------------------------------------------

    From 2013 through 2022, the Reserve Banks recovered 102.5 percent 
of their total expenses (including imputed costs) and targeted after-
tax profits or return on equity (ROE) for the mature services. During 
that period, Check Services, the Fedwire[supreg] Funds Service, 
National Settlement Service (NSS), and Fedwire[supreg] Securities 
Service achieved full cost recovery. The FedACH[supreg] Service 
achieved 98.1 percent cost recovery as a result of the Reserve Banks' 
development and implementation of a multiyear technology initiative to 
modernize the capabilities of the FedACH Service processing platform. 
Although the modernized platform was implemented in 2021, the Reserve 
Banks are continuing to invest in platform capabilities, as well as 
resiliency, as part of a broader enhancement strategy. At the same 
time, the Reserve Banks have made limited changes to existing FedACH 
Service fees to provide price stability for customers in alignment with 
pricing policies.\2\
---------------------------------------------------------------------------

    \2\ In alignment with the Board's Principles for the Pricing of 
Federal Reserve Bank Services, the Reserve Banks will continue to 
assess the tradeoffs between price stability for customers, 
investment in technology infrastructure to reflect desirable longer-
run improvements in the ACH system, and the expectation of achieving 
full cost recovery for the FedACH Service over the long run. See 
Board of Governors of the Federal Reserve System, ``Adoption of Fee 
Schedules and Pricing Principles for Federal Reserve Bank 
Services,'' 46 FR 1338, 1343 (Jan. 6, 1981). Available at <a href="https://cdn.loc.gov/service/ll/fedreg/fr046/fr046003/fr046003.pdf">https://cdn.loc.gov/service/ll/fedreg/fr046/fr046003/fr046003.pdf</a>.
---------------------------------------------------------------------------

    The Board communicated in its 2019 Notice Federal Reserve Actions 
to Support Interbank Settlement of Instant Payments (``2019 Notice'') 
that it expects the FedNow[supreg] Service to achieve its first 
instance of long-run cost recovery outside the 10-year time frame 
typically applied to mature services. New services like the FedNow 
Service may not initially have stable volumes, costs, and revenues.\3\ 
Thus, FedNow

[[Page 82357]]

Service revenue and expenses are excluded from the overall performance 
projections. The FedNow Service is discussed in section G.
---------------------------------------------------------------------------

    \3\ Application of the 10-year rolling time frame used to 
evaluate mature services to the FedNow Service would result in 
prohibitively high or unnecessarily volatile pricing, negatively 
affecting the Federal Reserve's public policy objectives in 
providing the service. See ``Federal Reserve Actions to Support 
Interbank Settlement of Instant Payments,'' 84 FR 39297, (August 9, 
2019). Available at <a href="https://www.govinfo.gov/content/pkg/FR-2019-08-09/pdf/2019-17027.pdf">https://www.govinfo.gov/content/pkg/FR-2019-08-09/pdf/2019-17027.pdf</a>.
---------------------------------------------------------------------------

    Table 1 summarizes 2022 actual, 2023 forecasted, and 2024 budgeted 
annual cost recovery rates for all mature priced services. Cost 
recovery is forecasted to be 104.4 percent in 2023 and forecasted to be 
103.0 percent in 2024.

\a\ The 2023 budget figures reflect the final budgets as approved by the Board of Governors in December 2022.
  See Board of Governors of the Federal Reserve System, ``2023 Federal Reserve Banks Budgets'' available at
  <a href="https://www.federalreserve.gov/foia/files/2023ReserveBankBudgets.pdf">https://www.federalreserve.gov/foia/files/2023ReserveBankBudgets.pdf</a>.
\b\ The 2024 budget figures reflect preliminary budget information from the Reserve Banks. The Reserve Banks
  will submit final budget data to the Board for consideration by December 2023.

    1. 2023 Forecasted Performance--The Reserve Banks forecast that 
they will recover 104.4 percent of the costs of providing mature priced 
services in 2023, including total expense and targeted ROE, compared 
with a 2023 budgeted recovery rate of 98.2 percent, as shown in Table 
2. Overall, the Reserve Banks forecast that they will fully recover 
actual and imputed costs and earn net income of $29.4 million, compared 
with the targeted ROE of $8.3 million. The Reserve Banks forecast that 
all services will achieve full cost recovery in 2023.
    2. 2024 Private-Sector Adjustment Factor--The 2024 PSAF for Reserve 
Bank mature priced services is $29.2 million.\4\ This amount represents 
an increase of $5.5 million from the 2023 PSAF of $23.7 million. This 
increase is attributable to a $6.1 million increase in the cost of 
capital primarily driven by rising interest rates, and a $0.8 million 
increase in Board of Governors expenses, offset by a $1.4 million 
decrease in sales tax.
---------------------------------------------------------------------------

    \4\ The FedNow Service launched in July 2023. Inclusive of the 
FedNow Service, the PSAF increases to $46.3 million for 2024. Per 
its 2019 Notice ``Federal Reserve Actions to Support Interbank 
Settlement of Faster Payments'' (``2019 Notice''), the Board has 
determined that it is most appropriate to report FedNow Service cost 
recovery independently of mature priced services until the service 
has relatively stable revenues and costs. Thus, FedNow Service 
revenue is excluded from overall performance projections for 2023. 
See ``Federal Reserve Actions to Support Interbank Settlement of 
Faster Payments,'' 4 FR 39297, (August 9, 2019). Available here: 
Federal Register: Federal Reserve Actions To Support Interbank 
Settlement of Faster Payments.
---------------------------------------------------------------------------

    3. 2024 Projected Performance--The Reserve Banks project a mature 
priced services cost recovery rate of 103.0 percent in 2024, with a net 
gain of $24.4 million and targeted ROE of $9.7 million. The Reserve 
Banks project that each of the individual service lines will achieve 
full cost recovery in 2024 except for Check Services. Check Services 
are expected to under recover primarily because of anticipated volume 
declines. The Reserve Banks' primary risks to current projections are 
unanticipated volume and revenue reductions and the potential for cost 
overruns from new and ongoing improvement initiatives.
    4. 2024 Pricing--The following summarizes the Reserve Banks' 
changes

[[Page 82358]]

to fee schedules for priced services in 2024:

Check Services

    The Reserve Banks will increase participation fees and Reject 
Repair fees and reduce fixed fees across image cash letter options. The 
Reserve Banks will additionally replace their existing 5:00 a.m. 
eastern time (ET) and 9:30 a.m. ET forward check deposit deadlines with 
a single consolidated deadline at 7:30 a.m. ET. The Reserve Banks will 
reassign their customers across new volume tiers based on recent actual 
levels, a process they perform every year. These changes will help 
address declining check volumes and continue a value-based pricing 
strategy for financial institutions.

FedACH Service

    The Reserve Banks will increase the FedACH settlement fee for some 
customers and introduce a new FedACH receipt 5-year discount program 
for customers with Premium Receiver status. These changes will help 
address ongoing operational costs while also providing incentives for 
customers who handle high volumes of FedACH receipts.

Fedwire Funds Service

    The Reserve Banks will increase the Fedwire Funds transfer price 
for all three tiers, the participation fee, and the FedPayments[supreg] 
Manager Import/Export fee. These changes will help address costs 
stemming from ongoing customer enhancement projects and will increase 
overall fixed fee revenue.

National Settlement Service

    The Reserve Banks will increase the National Settlement Service 
pre-file and pre-entry fees. These changes will help address rising 
operational costs.

Fedwire Securities Service

    The Reserve Banks will maintain prices at existing levels for all 
priced Fedwire Securities Service products.

FedNow Service

    The Reserve Banks will maintain the previous year's fee schedule, 
inclusive of discounts to the monthly participation fee as well as for 
customer credit transfers under a threshold of 2,500 per month.\5\ 
These discounts will support financial institution testing and 
validation of 24x7 instant payments processing capabilities. 
Additionally, to support initial onboarding, the Reserve Banks will 
continue to discount certain FedLine[supreg] Solutions fees. New 
FedLine Advantage[supreg] channel connections or upgrades from existing 
FedLine Solutions to FedLine Advantage will be discounted to $0.00 for 
a rolling 12-month period following initiation.
---------------------------------------------------------------------------

    \5\ See Federal Register Notice for Federal Reserve Bank 
Services (December 12, 2022). Available here: Federal Register:: 
Federal Reserve Bank Services
---------------------------------------------------------------------------

FedLine Solutions

    The Reserve Banks will increase the monthly fees for 
FedMail[supreg], the FedMail Email [agrave] la carte option, and all 
electronic access service offered by Accounting Information Services. 
The Reserve Banks will also introduce a new FedLine Web[supreg] pricing 
tier called FedLine Web Premier to reflect the value-add service of 
check payment automation. These changes will help address the rising 
operating costs for attended access and extended support for the FedNow 
Service.
    For the mature services, these changes collectively are an average 
price increase of 1.8 percent. The price changes are in line with the 
Reserve Banks' strategy to offset rising costs, diversify revenue 
sources, and continue to reduce pricing volatility associated with 
volume-based pricing. For the FedNow Service, the Reserve Banks 
continue to focus on adoption and achieving network effects as a new 
service.
    B. Private-Sector Adjustment Factor--The imputed debt financing 
costs, targeted ROE, and effective tax rate are based on a U.S. 
publicly traded market model.\6\ The method for calculating the 
financing costs in the PSAF requires determining the appropriate 
imputed levels of debt and equity and then applying the applicable 
financing rates. In this process, a pro forma balance sheet using 
estimated assets and liabilities associated with the Reserve Banks' 
priced services is developed, and the remaining elements that would 
exist are imputed as if these priced services were provided by a 
private business firm. The same generally accepted accounting 
principles that apply to commercial-entity financial statements apply 
to the relevant elements in the priced services pro forma financial 
statements.
---------------------------------------------------------------------------

    \6\ Data for U.S. publicly traded firms is from the Standard and 
Poor's Compustat[supreg] database. This database contains 
information on more than 6,000 U.S. publicly traded firms, which 
approximates information for the entirety of the U.S. market.
---------------------------------------------------------------------------

    The portion of Federal Reserve assets that will be used to provide 
priced services during the coming year is determined using information 
about actual assets and projected disposals and acquisitions. The 
priced portion of these assets is determined based on the allocation of 
depreciation and amortization expenses of each asset class. The priced 
portion of actual Federal Reserve liabilities consists of post-
employment and post-retirement benefits, accounts payable, and other 
liabilities. The priced portion of the actual net pension asset or 
liability is also included on the balance sheet.\7\
---------------------------------------------------------------------------

    \7\ The pension assets are netted with the pension liabilities 
and reported as a net asset or net liability as required by ASC 715 
Compensation--Retirement Benefits.
---------------------------------------------------------------------------

    The equity financing rate is the targeted ROE produced by the 
capital asset pricing model (CAPM). In the CAPM, the required rate of 
return on a firm's equity is equal to the return on a risk-free asset 
plus a market risk premium. The risk-free rate is based on the three-
month Treasury bill; the beta is assumed to be equal to 1.0, which 
approximates the risk of the market as a whole; and the market risk 
premium is based on the monthly returns in excess of the risk-free rate 
over the most recent 40 years. The resulting ROE reflects the return a 
shareholder would expect when investing in a private business firm.
    For simplicity, given that federal corporate income tax rates are 
graduated, state income tax rates vary, and various credits and 
deductions can apply, an actual income tax expense is not explicitly 
calculated for Reserve Bank priced services. Instead, the Board targets 
a pretax ROE that would provide sufficient income to fulfill the priced 
services' imputed income tax obligations. To the extent that 
performance results are greater or less than the targeted ROE, income 
taxes are adjusted using the effective tax rate.
    Capital structure. The capital structure is imputed based on the 
imputed funding need (assets less liabilities), subject to minimum 
equity constraints. Short-term debt is imputed to fund the imputed 
short-term funding need. Long-term debt and equity are imputed to meet 
the priced services long-term funding need at a ratio based on the 
capital structure of the U.S. publicly traded market.\8\ Any equity 
imputed that exceeds the amount needed to fund the priced services' 
assets and meet the minimum equity constraints is offset by a reduction 
in imputed long-term debt. When imputed

[[Page 82359]]

equity is larger than what can be offset by imputed debt, the excess is 
imputed as investments in Treasury securities; income imputed on these 
investments reduces the PSAF.
---------------------------------------------------------------------------

    \8\ The FDIC rule, which was adopted as final on April 14, 2014, 
requires that well-capitalized institutions meet or exceed the 
following standards: (1) total capital to risk-weighted assets ratio 
of at least 10 percent, (2) tier 1 capital to risk-weighted assets 
ratio of at least 8 percent, (3) common equity tier 1 capital to 
risk-weighted assets ratio of at least 6.5 percent, and (4) a 
leverage ratio (tier 1 capital to total assets) of at least 5 
percent. Because all of the Federal Reserve priced services' equity 
on the pro forma balance sheet qualifies as tier 1 capital, only 
requirements 1 and 4 are binding. The FDIC rule can be located at 12 
CFR 324.403(b).
---------------------------------------------------------------------------

    Application of the Federal Reserve Policy on Payment System Risk 
(PSR policy) to the Fedwire Funds Service. The Board's PSR policy 
incorporates the international standards for financial market 
infrastructures (FMIs) developed by the Committee on Payments and 
Market Infrastructures and the Technical Committee of the International 
Organization of Securities Commissions in the Principles for Financial 
Market Infrastructures.\9\ The Board recognizes the critical role the 
Fedwire Services, including the Fedwire Funds Service, play in the 
financial system and requires them to meet or exceed the risk-
management standards in the policy, consistent with relevant guidance 
and the requirements in the MCA.\10\ Principle 15 states that an FMI 
should identify, monitor, and manage general business risk and hold 
sufficient liquid net assets funded by equity to cover potential 
general business losses so that it can continue operations and services 
as a going concern if those losses materialize. Further, liquid net 
assets should at all times be sufficient to ensure a recovery or 
orderly wind-down of critical operations and services. The Fedwire 
Funds Service does not face the risk that a business shock would cause 
the service to wind down in a disorderly manner and disrupt the 
stability of the financial system. To foster competition with private-
sector FMIs, however, the Reserve Banks' priced services will hold an 
amount equivalent to six months of the Fedwire Funds Service's current 
operating expenses as liquid financial assets and equity on the pro 
forma balance sheet.\11\ Current operating expenses are defined as 
normal business operating expenses on the income statement, less 
depreciation, amortization, taxes, and interest on debt. Using the 
Fedwire Funds Service's preliminary 2024 budget, six months of current 
operating expenses would be $68.5 million. In 2024, $68.5 million of 
equity was imputed to meet the FDIC capital requirements and was 
sufficient to meet the PSR policy requirement.
---------------------------------------------------------------------------

    \9\ Principles for Financial Market Infrastructures, <a href="https://www.bis.org/cpmi/publ/d101a.pdf">https://www.bis.org/cpmi/publ/d101a.pdf</a>.
    \10\ Certain standards may require flexibility in the way they 
are applied to central bank-operated systems because of central 
banks' unique role in the financial markets and their public 
responsibilities. These principles include principle 2 on 
governance, principle 3 on the framework for the comprehensive 
management of risks, principle 4 on credit risk, principle 5 on 
collateral, principle 7 on liquidity risk, principle 13 on 
participant-default rules and procedures, principle 15 on general 
business risk, and principle 18 on access and participation 
requirements. See PSR Policy Part I.B.1.a.
    \11\ This requirement does not apply to the Fedwire Securities 
Service. There are no private-sector competitors to the Fedwire 
Securities Service that would be expected to meet such a 
requirement. Imposing such a requirement when pricing the securities 
services could artificially increase the cost of these services.
---------------------------------------------------------------------------

    Effective tax rate. Like the imputed capital structure, the 
effective tax rate is calculated based on data from U.S. publicly 
traded firms. The tax rate is the mean of the weighted average rates of 
the U.S. publicly traded market over the past five years.
    Debt and equity financing. The imputed short- and long-term debt 
financing rates are derived from the nonfinancial commercial paper 
rates from the Federal Reserve Board's H.15 Selected Interest Rates 
release (AA and A2/P2) and the annual Merrill Lynch Corporate & High 
Yield Index rate, respectively. The equity financing rate is described 
above. The rates for debt and equity financing are applied to the 
priced services estimated imputed short-term debt, long-term debt, and 
equity needed to finance short- and long-term assets and meet equity 
requirements.
    The 2024 PSAF is $29.2 million, compared with $23.7 million in 
2023. The increase of $5.5 million is attributable to a net $6.1 
million increase in the cost of capital, and a $0.8 million increase in 
Board of Governors expenses, offset by a $1.4 million decrease in sales 
tax. The net $6.1 million increase in cost of capital is primarily 
driven by a $1.6 million increase in ROE imputed to satisfy FDIC 
requirements for a well-capitalized institution and rising interest 
rates resulting in a $4.5 million increase in cost of debt.
    The PSAF expense of $29.2 million, detailed in Table 5, includes 
$17.7 million for capital funding, $7.6 million for Board of Governors' 
expense, and $3.9 million in sales tax expense.
    As shown in Table 3, 2024 total assets of $816.1 million increased 
by $10.5 million from 2023. The net increase in total assets includes 
an additional $62.6 million long-term assets partially offset by a net 
$52.1 million decrease in short-term assets and imputed investments.
    The net long-term asset increase of $62.6 million primarily 
consists of a $94.4 million increase in the net pension asset, 
reflecting higher surplus and higher discount rate. The increase is 
partially offset by a decrease in the deferred tax asset of $28.1 
million due to the higher discount rate.
    The decrease in the short-term assets is primarily driven by a 
$67.2 million decrease in the imputed investments in Treasury 
securities from imputed equity required to meet FDIC capital 
requirements for a well-capitalized institution and to comply with the 
PSR policy, partially offset by a $37.0 million increase in imputed 
investments in Fed Funds.
    The capital structure of the 2024 pro forma balance sheet, provided 
in Table 4, is composed of equity of $68.5 million, or 12.3 percent of 
the 2024 risk-weighted assets detailed in Table 6, and long-term debt 
of $100.3 million. The 2024 capital structure differs from that of 
2023, which was composed of $69.5 million of equity and no long-term 
debt. Provided in Table 5, the 2024 initially imputed equity required 
to fund assets and meet the publicly traded firm model capital 
requirements is $68.5 million. As long-term assets are marginally 
greater than long-term liabilities, long-term debt of $100.36 million 
was imputed at the observed market ratio of 59.4 percent. The equity of 
$68.5 million was adequate to meet the FDIC capital requirements for a 
well-capitalized institution and sufficient to satisfy the PSR policy 
requirements.
    The net Accumulated Other Comprehensive loss is $551.0 million, 
compared with $640.8 million in 2023. The $89.8 million increase is 
primarily attributable to a higher discount rate. The net Accumulated 
Other Comprehensive loss position does not reduce the total imputed 
equity required to fund priced services assets or fulfill the FDIC 
equity requirements for a well-capitalized institution.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

    1. 2023 Forecast--The Reserve Banks forecast that Check Services 
will recover 101.2 percent of total expenses and targeted ROE, compared 
with a 2023 budgeted recovery rate of 96.7 percent.
---------------------------------------------------------------------------

    \12\ Credit float, which represents the difference between items 
in process of collection and deferred credit items, occurs when the 
Reserve Banks debit the paying bank for transactions before 
providing credit to the depositing bank. Float is directly estimated 
at the service level.
    \13\ Consistent with the Board's PSR policy, the Reserve Banks' 
priced services will hold an amount equivalent to six months of the 
Fedwire Funds Service's current operating expenses as liquid net 
financial assets and equity on the pro forma balance sheet. Six 
months of the Fedwire Funds Service's projected current operating 
expenses is $68.5 million. In 2024, the amount of equity was 
sufficient to meet the regulatory capital requirements and no 
additional equity was imputed.
    \14\ Includes the allocation of Board of Governors assets to 
priced services of $3.5 million for 2024 and $2.7 million for 2023.
    \15\ Includes the allocation of Board of Governors liabilities 
to priced services of $1.2 million for 2024 and $1.3 million for 
2023.
    \16\ Includes an accumulated other comprehensive loss of $551.0 
million for 2024 and $640.8 million for 2023, which reflects the 
ongoing amortization of the accumulated loss in accordance with ASC 
715. Future gains or losses, and their effects on the pro forma 
balance sheet, cannot be projected. See Table 5 for calculation of 
required imputed equity amount.
    \17\ Imputed short-term debt financing is computed as the 
difference between short-term assets and short-term liabilities. As 
presented in table 5, the financing costs of imputed short-term 
debt, imputed long-term debt and imputed equity are the elements of 
cost of capital, which contribute to the calculation of the PSAF.
    \18\ If minimum equity constraints are not met after imputing 
equity based on the capital structure observed in the market, 
additional equity is imputed to meet these constraints. The long-
term funding need was met by imputing long-term debt and equity 
based on the capital structure observed in the market (see Tables 4 
and 6). In 2023, the amount of imputed equity met the minimum equity 
requirements for risk-weighted assets.
    \19\ Equity adjustment offsets are due to a shift of long-term 
debt funding to equity in order to meet FDIC capital requirements 
for well-capitalized institutions.
    \20\ Additional equity in excess of that needed to fund priced 
services assets is offset by an asset balance of imputed investments 
in Treasury securities.
    \21\ Imputed short-term debt and long-term debt are computed in 
Table 4.
    \22\ The 2024 ROE is equal to a risk-free rate plus a risk 
premium (beta * market risk premium). The 2023 after-tax CAPM ROE is 
calculated as 5.50% + (1.0 * 8.60%) = 14.11%. Using a tax rate of 
18.8%, the after-tax ROE is converted into a pretax ROE, which 
results in a pretax ROE of (14.11%/(1-18.8%)) = 17.38%. Calculations 
may be affected by rounding.
    \23\ If minimum equity constraints are not met after imputing 
equity based on all other financial statement components, additional 
equity is imputed to meet these constraints. Additional equity 
imputed to meet minimum equity requirements is invested solely in 
Treasury securities. The imputed investments are similar to those 
for which rates are available on the Federal Reserve's H.15 
statistical release, which can be located at <a href="http://www.federalreserve.gov/releases/h15/data.htm">http://www.federalreserve.gov/releases/h15/data.htm</a>.
    \24\ The investments are imputed based on the amounts arising 
from the collection of items before providing credit according to 
established availability schedules.
---------------------------------------------------------------------------

    Through August 2023, total commercial forward and total commercial 
return check volumes were 6.7 percent lower and 3.9 percent greater, 
respectively, than they were during the same period last year. For 
full-year 2023, the Reserve Banks estimate that their total forward 
check volume will decline 7.2 percent (compared with a budgeted decline 
of 8.0 percent) and their total return check volume will increase 1.4 
percent (compared with a budgeted decline of 6.0 percent) from 2022 
levels. The Reserve Banks expect that check volumes will continue to 
decline because of ongoing substitution away from checks to other 
payment instruments.
    2. 2024 Pricing--The Reserve Banks expect Check Services to recover 
95.4 percent of total expenses and targeted ROE in 2024. The Reserve 
Banks project revenue to be $106.1 million, a decline of $4.6 million, 
or 4.1 percent from the 2023 forecast. Total expenses for Check 
Services are projected to be $109.1 million, an increase of $1.0 
million, or 1.0 percent, from 2023 forecasted expenses.
    As check volumes continue to decline, the proposed pricing 
increases are intended to help stabilize check revenues, to shift the 
revenue mix toward fixed fees, and to continue a value-based pricing 
strategy for financial institutions that use the service. To that end, 
the Reserve Banks will increase the pricing tiers for the fixed monthly 
participation and Reject Repair fees. These fee changes support the 
cost of maintaining FRFS Check Services infrastructure as fewer checks 
are written each year and follow the Check Services business line's 
pricing strategy to increase the share of revenue collected from fixed 
fees. Table 8 displayed below shows the 2024-tiered participation fees.

[[Page 82363]]

------------------------------------------------------------------------

    The Reserve Banks will also increase Reject Repair fees for both 
basic and premium users by $0.05. The Reserve Banks will also eliminate 
forward check deposit deadlines--5:00 a.m. ET and 9:30 a.m. ET--and 
implement a new deadline at 7:30 a.m. ET to further simplify the FRFS 
Check Deposit structure. Removing the 9:30 a.m. ET deposit deadline and 
instituting a 7:30 a.m. ET deadline will eliminate debit float and 
provide customers two-and-a-half additional hours to deposit.\26\
---------------------------------------------------------------------------

    \25\ This fee is charged to financial institutions that have 
received any Check 21 electronic or substitute check volume (forward 
or return) from the Reserve Banks during the month. The fee is 
applied at the parent financial institution level, as defined in the 
Reserve Banks' Global Customer Directory. Each financial 
institution's tier assignment is determined by the criteria 
described in the FedForward Standard Endpoint Tier Listing.
    \26\ Because of FRFS' existing 8:00 a.m. ET Premium Delivery 
service, there are items deposited between 7:30 a.m. and 9:30 a.m. 
today that cannot be presented on a same-day basis and therefore are 
held over until the following business day, thus the Federal Reserve 
incurs debit float in the process.
---------------------------------------------------------------------------

    The Standard Daily Fee B Image Cash Letter (ICL) Option will 
consequently be eliminated as the deposit option only provides deposit 
deadlines at the 5:30 a.m. ET and 7:30 a.m. ET deadlines the Reserve 
Banks intend to terminate. The tables below outline the eliminated and 
new deposit deadlines:

    In order to maintain volume stability, fixed fees across image cash 
letter options and volume thresholds for some customers will decrease 
in 2024. To that end, Daily Fixed Fees for FedForward [supreg] Services 
Premium Daily B image cash letters will be reduced by $100, from $1,700 
to $1,600, and for FedForward Premium Daily C image cash letters by 
$250, from $3,400 to $3,150. Volume thresholds for Retail Payments 
Premium Receivers will be reduced from 2 million to 1 million items for 
Level 2 receivers and from 2 million to 1.5 million items for Level 3 
receivers.
    Finally, the Reserve Banks evaluate and set tier assignments every 
other year based on changes in the volume of items received by 
endpoints. These tier changes are designed to keep customers assigned 
to the appropriate tier based on their volume, daily fixed fee 
reductions, and volume threshold reductions that will allow customers 
to qualify for discounts more often as the circulation of checks 
decline. In 2024, the Reserve Banks will reassign the tier placement of 
672 customers in FedForward Standard's tiers, 389 customers in 
FedForward Premium Daily's tiers, 36 customers in the FedReturn[supreg] 
Standard's tiers, and 36 customers in FedReturn Premium Daily's tiers. 
Following these reassignments, the Reserve Banks will charge these 
customer segments in accordance to their tier's participation fee.
    From the above price changes, the Reserve Banks estimate all 
customer segments will experience an average increase of 0.8 percent of 
their total FRFS projected charges.
    The Reserve Banks' primary risk to current projections for Check 
Services is a greater than expected decline in check volume due to the 
general reduction in check writing, substitution away from checks to 
other payment instruments, and competition from correspondent banks, 
aggregators, and direct exchanges, which would result in lower than 
anticipated revenue.

----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

    1. 2023 Forecast--The Reserve Banks forecast that FedACH Services 
will recover 105.9 percent of total expenses and targeted ROE, compared 
with a 2023 budgeted recovery rate of 99.0 percent.
    Through August 2023, FedACH commercial origination and receipt 
volume was 0.4 percent higher and 2.0 percent higher, respectively, 
than they were during the same period last year. For full year 2023, 
the Reserve Banks estimate that FedACH commercial origination and 
receipt volume will increase 0.2 percent and 1.1 percent, respectively, 
from 2022 levels, compared with a budgeted increase of 0.6 percent and 
decline of 1.3 percent.
    2. 2024 Pricing--The Reserve Banks expect FedACH Services to 
recover 105.8 percent of total expenses and targeted ROE in 2024. The 
Reserve Banks project revenue to be $184.8 million, an increase of $1.8 
million, or 1.0 percent, from the 2023 forecast. Total expenses are 
projected to be $171.0 million, an increase of $0.4 million, or 0.2 
percent, from the 2023 forecast.
    The Reserve Banks will increase the monthly ACH Settlement Fee from 
$100 to $110 per RTN per month for receivers in Tier 2 and from $200 to 
$250 per RTN per month for receivers in Tier 3.\27\ The price changes 
are driven by ongoing operational costs and increased costs associated 
with the continued introduction of additional intraday settlement 
windows to the FedACH Service.
---------------------------------------------------------------------------

    \27\ Premium Receivers, Tier 1, will be subject to a settlement 
fee of $60 per RTN per month. Non-Premium Receivers with a volume 
threshold of less than 1,500,000 items per month, Tier 2, will be 
subject to a settlement fee of $110 per RTN per month. Non-Premium 
Receivers with a volume threshold of more than 1,500,000 items per 
month, Tier 3, will be subject to a settlement fee of $250 per RTN 
per month.
---------------------------------------------------------------------------

    The Reserve Banks will introduce a new FedACH receipt 5-year 
discount program for FedACH customers with Premium Receiver status.\28\ 
Eligible customers (Premium Receivers) that choose to participate in 
the program will receive the following discounts for a five-year period 
as long as during that time they also maintain their existing Premium 
Receiver status:
---------------------------------------------------------------------------

    \28\ Premium Receivers are Receiving Depository Financial 
Institutions (RDFIs) receiving through FedACH at least 90 percent of 
their FedACH-originated items, but less than 90 percent of all of 
their ACH items originated through any operator (Level One); or 
RDFIs receiving through FedACH at least 90 percent of all of their 
ACH items originated through any operator (Level Two).
---------------------------------------------------------------------------

    <bullet> Customers with more than 30 million FedACH receipt items 
per month:
    [cir] $0.0002 per-item discount on all forward receipt items 
received through FedACH for the full 5-year length of the agreement
    [cir] 50 percent discount on the FedACH FedPayments Reporter 
service (FPR) for two years at any point during participation in the 
program
    [cir] 100 percent discount on the FedACH Exception Resolution 
Service (ERS) for two years at any point during their participation in 
the program
    [cir] 100 percent discount on the FedACH FedPayments Insights 
service (FPI) for two years at any point during their participation in 
the program
    <bullet> Customers with between 5 and 30 million FedACH receipt 
items per month
    [cir] $0.0001 per-item discount on all forward receipt items 
received through FedACH for the full 5-year length of the agreement
    [cir] 25 percent discount on the FedACH FedPayments Reporter 
service (FPR) for two years at any point during their participation in 
the program
    [cir] 50 percent discount on the FedACH Exception Resolution 
Service (ERS) for two years at any point during their participation in 
the program
    [cir] 50 percent discount on the FedACH FedPayments Insights 
service (FPI) for two years at any point during their participation in 
the program
    All of these discounts will be off of the price on the FedACH fee 
schedule for which a customer would otherwise qualify if they didn't 
participate in the program. Eligible customers that choose not to 
participate in the program will continue to pay the existing fees for 
which they qualify, as delineated on the FedACH fee schedule. If any 
customer participating in the program violates the tenets of the 
program at any time, i.e., drops below the 5 million FedACH receipt 
items per month threshold and/or does not maintain the Premium Receiver 
status (Level One or Two) they had as of the signing of the agreement, 
they will be removed from the program and will be charged by FRFS for 
all of the discounts they had accumulated since joining the program.
    The Reserve Banks estimate the above price changes will result in a 
0.3 percent average price decrease for FedACH customers.
    In addition, the Reserve Banks expect to offer an ex-post Payment 
Anomaly Service at some point in 2024 to identify unusual activity on 
payments that have been cleared and settled through the FedACH Service. 
Additional details will be forthcoming through normal Reserve Bank 
channels.
    The Reserve Banks' primary risks to current projections for the 
FedACH Service are unanticipated cost overruns associated with 
continued technology and resiliency investments, and lower-than-
projected volumes and growth due to the market and economic 
environment.

----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

    1. 2023 Forecast--The Reserve Banks forecast that the Fedwire Funds 
Service and the National Settlement Service will recover 101.3 percent 
of total expenses and targeted ROE, compared with a 2023 budgeted 
recovery rate of 96.2 percent.
    Through August 2023, Fedwire Funds Service online volume was 2.5 
percent lower than it was during the same period last year. For full-
year 2023, the Reserve Banks estimate that Fedwire Funds Service online 
volume will increase 0.1 percent from 2022 levels, compared with a 
budgeted increase of 2.9 percent. Through August 2023, the National 
Settlement Service settlement file volume was 3.0 percent lower than it 
was during the same period last year, and settlement entry volume was 
1.0 percent lower. For full-year 2023, the Reserve Banks estimate that 
settlement file volume will decrease 3.5 percent (compared with a 
budgeted decrease of 0.1 percent) and settlement entry volume will 
decrease 0.8 percent (compared with a budgeted 0.4 percent increase) 
from 2022 levels.
    2. 2024 Pricing--The Reserve Banks expect the Fedwire Funds Service 
and the National Settlement Service to recover 103.2 percent of total 
expenses in 2024. Revenue is projected to be $163.8 million, an 
increase of $0.2 million, or 0.2 percent from the 2023 forecast. The 
Reserve Banks project total expenses to be $155.6 million, a decrease 
of $1.6 million, or 1 percent, from the 2023 forecast. Although overall 
expenses are decreasing, the largest technology initiative for the 
Fedwire Funds Service is the transition to the ISO 20022 messaging 
format.\29\ In addition, the National Settlement Service continues to 
incur higher costs because of the expansion of its operating hours in 
2022.\30\
---------------------------------------------------------------------------

    \29\ In October 2021, the Board announced that the Federal 
Reserve Banks will adopt the ISO 20022 message format for the 
Fedwire[supreg] Funds Service. See New Message Format for the 
Fedwire Funds Services, 86 FR 55600 (June 27, 2022). Available at 
Federal Register Notice: New Message Format for the Fedwire Funds 
Service.
    \30\ The National Settlement Service expanded its hours to 21.5 
hours per day in 2022, with a new 9:00 p.m. ET open for the next 
business day.
---------------------------------------------------------------------------

    The Reserve Banks will increase all three of the gross origination 
and receipt tiered fees. The tier 1 fee will increase from $0.92 to 
$0.94, the tier 2 fee will increase from $0.285 to $0.29, and the tier 
3 fee will increase from $0.18 to $0.19. In addition, the Fedwire Funds 
Service participation fee will increase from $100 to $115, alongside a 
FedPayments Manger Import/Export fee increase of $50 to $60. The 
Reserve Banks will change National Settlement Service fees for 2024. 
The per file fee will increase from $30 to $35, and the per entry fee 
will increase from $1.50 to $1.70. The Reserve Banks estimate the above 
price changes will result in a 5 percent average price increase for 
customers. In addition to addressing the rising expenses noted above, 
these fee increases serve to balance additional costs incurred by the 
National Settlement Service since their last fee increase in 2014. In 
particular, ongoing maintenance and personnel costs largely related to 
the expansion of operating hours, which are subject to inflationary 
pressures, have increased considerably in the interim.
    In addition, these fee increases will help address diminishing 
fixed fee revenue from the Fedwire Funds Service as fee revenue has 
become increasingly dependent on variable resources. To note, the 
percentage of fixed fee revenue has decreased from 12 percent in 2014 
to 7 percent in 2023. This has resulted in larger variances in fee 
revenue as volume moves higher or lower. The proposed fee increases 
will bolster the percentage of fixed fee revenue to approximately 8 
percent in 2024.
    The Reserve Banks' primary risk to current projections for these 
services is uncertainty about the economic outlook for 2024, which 
complicates the accuracy of 2024 volume projections. Historically, 
Fedwire Funds Service volume has reflected market conditions, and a 
broader downturn in 2024 would likely result in a decrease in Fedwire 
Funds Service volume.\31\ Separately, unexpected increases in 2024 
technology costs would likely result in reduced cost recovery for the 
year.
---------------------------------------------------------------------------

    \31\ Fedwire Funds Service volume growth reflects economic 
growth. For example, its volume has grown every year except for 2008 
and 2009, when it contracted 2.5 percent and 5.0 percent, 
respectively, during the Great Recession. For historical Fedwire 
Funds Service volume data, see <a href="http://frbservices.org">frbservices.org</a>, ``Fedwire Funds 
Service--Annual Statistics. Available at: <a href="https://www.frbservices.org/resources/financial-services/wires/volume-value-stats/annual-stats.html">https://www.frbservices.org/resources/financial-services/wires/volume-value-stats/annual-stats.html</a>.

    F. Fedwire Securities Service--Table 11 shows the 2022 actual, 2023 
forecast, and 2024 budgeted cost-recovery performance for the Fedwire 
Securities Service.\32\
---------------------------------------------------------------------------

    \32\ The Reserve Banks provide transfer services for securities 
issued by the U.S. Treasury, federal government agencies, 
government-sponsored enterprises, and certain international 
institutions. Prior to 2023, the priced component of this service 
consisted of revenues, expenses, and volumes associated with the 
transfer of all non-Treasury securities. Starting in 2023, the 
revenues, expenses, and volumes associated with the transfer of 
Treasury securities are also included in the priced component of 
this service.

----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

    1. 2023 Forecast--The Reserve Banks forecast that the Fedwire 
Securities Service will recover 118.9 percent of total expenses and 
targeted ROE, compared with a 2023 budgeted recovery rate of 106.5 
percent.
    Through August 2023, Treasury security transfer volume was 24.3 
percent higher than it was during the same period last year. For full-
year 2023, the Reserve Banks estimate that Treasury security transfer 
volume will increase 17.7 percent from 2022 levels, compared with a 
budgeted increase of 1.0 percent. Through August 2023, Agency security 
transfer volume was 11.1 percent lower than it was during the same 
period last year. For full-year 2023, the Reserve Banks estimate that 
Agency security transfer volume will decrease 9.4 percent from 2022 
levels, compared with a budgeted decrease of 9.2 percent.
    Through August 2023, account maintenance volume was 1.9 percent 
lower than it was during the same period last year. For full-year 2023, 
the Reserve Banks estimate that account maintenance volume will decline 
1.4 percent from 2022 levels, compared with a budgeted decline of 3.3 
percent. Through August 2023, the number of agency issues maintained 
was 2.0 percent higher than it was during the same period last year. 
For full-year 2023, the Reserve Banks estimate that the number of 
agency issues maintained will increase 1.3 percent from 2022 levels, 
compared with a budgeted decline of 0.1 percent.
    2. 2024 Pricing--The Reserve Banks expect the Fedwire Securities 
Service to recover 110.9 percent of total expenses and targeted ROE in 
2024. Revenue is projected to be $46.8 million, a decrease of $0.9 
million, or 2.0 percent, from the 2023 revenue forecast. The Reserve 
Banks also project that 2024 expenses will be $41.4 million, an 
increase of $1.7 million, or 4.3 percent from the 2023 forecast.
    The Reserve Banks will leave fee schedules for the Fedwire 
Securities Service unchanged in 2024. The Reserve Banks project that 
agency transfer volume will remain relatively stable compared with 
previous years, with no notable changes that could potentially have a 
significant impact on agency transfers. The volume of Treasury security 
transfers is projected to decrease due to the moderation of higher than 
expected Treasury security transfer volume in 2023. The volume of 
accounts maintained are expected to decrease 2.5 percent, consistent 
with recent trends and primarily driven by a reduction in joint custody 
accounts. The volume of agency issues maintained is expected to remain 
relatively flat, driven by the expecting slowing of net issuance of 
Agency MBS. Claim adjustment volume is expected to remain relatively 
stable consistent with recent trends.
    The Reserve Banks' primary risks to current projections for the 
Fedwire Securities Service include variations in technology costs and 
product volume forecasts stemming from an uncertain economic outlook.
    G. FedNow Service
    1. Cost to Introduce the FedNow Service--Following the FedNow 
Service launch in July 2023 and in alignment with its 2019 Federal 
Register Notice announcing its decision to introduce the service, the 
Board is publishing total cost to bring the FedNow Service to 
market.\33\ From August 2019 through July 2023, costs to introduce the 
FedNow Service totaled $545 million. These costs include efforts to 
develop key FedNow Service features and functionality, as well as 
activities to support financial institutions as they leverage the 
service to provide innovative instant payments solutions to individuals 
and businesses. This figure includes costs related to delivery of a 
secure and resilient payments infrastructure that leverages cloud-first 
design, and implementation of 24x7 operations to support processing 
around the clock. Additionally, costs include efforts to integrate the 
FedNow Service into existing Reserve Bank technology (for example, 
FedLine Solutions), implementation of a new seven-day accounting regime 
by the Federal Reserve, and education and readiness activities to 
prepare stakeholders across the payments ecosystem for adoption of the 
FedNow Service.
---------------------------------------------------------------------------

    \33\ See ``Federal Reserve Actions to Support Interbank 
Settlement of Instant Payments,'' (August 9, 2019). Available at 
2019-17027.pdf (<a href="http://govinfo.gov">govinfo.gov</a>). Per its 2019 Notice, the Board 
committed to disclosing costs related to development of the service 
beginning the year the service is available to participating banks.
---------------------------------------------------------------------------

    2. 2024 Pricing--The Reserve Banks will maintain the previous 
year's fee schedule, inclusive of discounts.\34\ With these discounts, 
the FedNow Service participation fee will be $0.00 in recognition of 
the limited network reach, and customer credit transfers (CCTs) under a 
threshold of 2,500 per month will be $0.00.\35\ The discount for a 
limited number of CCTs is intended to support institutions of all sizes 
as they validate processing capabilities in production through regular 
test transactions with partners as well as acclimate to 24x7 
operations. In addition, to encourage the onboarding of customers, new 
FedLine Advantage channel connections or upgrades from existing FedLine 
Solutions to FedLine Advantage will be discounted to $0.00 for a 
rolling 12-month period following initiation.
---------------------------------------------------------------------------

    \34\ This pricing is set to recover costs associated with mature 
volume estimates, when the service has relatively stable costs and 
revenues. This approach, which is in alignment with how the Reserve 
Banks have set fees for new services in the past, should limit 
prohibitively high or unnecessarily volatile pricing as the service 
matures. For instance, in establishing fees for the Federal 
Reserve's ACH service, the Board allowed fees to be set to recover 
costs associated with mature volume estimates instead of current 
costs. See Board of Governors of the Federal Reserve System, 
``Adoption of Fee Schedules and Pricing Principles for Federal 
Reserve Bank Services,'' 46 FR 1338, 1343 (Jan. 6, 1981). Available 
at: <a href="https://cdn.loc.gov/service/ll/fedreg/fr046/fr046003/fr046003.pdf">https://cdn.loc.gov/service/ll/fedreg/fr046/fr046003/fr046003.pdf</a>.
    \35\ The participation fee will only be charged to RTNs that are 
able to receive CCTs (Send & Receive or Receive-only participation 
types). The participation fee will not be charged to Liquidity 
Management Transfer (LMT) only and Settlement-only participation 
types in 2024. The discount for CCT results from offsetting the fees 
for the first 2,500 CCTs (per month) and will be applied per RTN 
enrolled in the FedNow Service.
---------------------------------------------------------------------------

    H. FedLine Solutions--The Reserve Banks charge fees for the 
electronic

[[Page 82367]]

connections that financial institutions use to access priced services 
and allocate the costs and revenues associated with this electronic 
access to the priced services.\36\ There are six FedLine Solutions 
channels through which customers can access the Reserve Banks' priced 
services: FedMail, FedLine Exchange[supreg], FedLine Web, FedLine 
Advantage, FedLine Command[supreg] and FedLine Direct[supreg].\37\ The 
Reserve Banks bundle these channels into 12 FedLine Solutions packages, 
described below, that are supplemented by a number of premium (or 
[agrave] la carte) access and accounting information options. In 
addition, the Reserve Banks offer FedComplete[supreg] packages, which 
are bundled offerings of FedLine connections and a fixed number of 
FedACH Services, Fedwire Funds Service, and Check 21-enabled 
transactions.\38\ FedLine Solutions packages offer attended or 
unattended access to critical payment and information services. 
FedMail, FedLine Exchange, FedLine Web, and FedLine Advantage packages 
offer attended or manual access via a web-based interface.\39\ In 
addition, FedLine Advantage offers attended access to the FedNow 
Service since its launch in July 2023. FedLine Command and FedLine 
Direct packages are computer-to-computer, internet protocol-based 
interfaces that support unattended access. The FedLine Command package 
offers an unattended connection to FedACH, most accounting information 
services, and the FedNow Service. FedLine Direct packages allow for 
unattended connections at multiple connection speeds to Check, FedACH, 
Fedwire Funds, and Fedwire Securities transactional and information 
services and to most accounting information services. In addition, 
FedLine Direct packages also allow for unattended connection to the 
FedNow Service.
---------------------------------------------------------------------------

    \36\ FedLine Solutions provide customers with access to Reserve 
Bank priced services. As a result, FedLine costs and revenue are 
allocated to the Reserve Banks' priced services on an expense ratio 
basis.
    \37\ FedMail, FedLine Exchange, FedLine Web, FedLine Advantage, 
FedLine Command, and FedLine Direct are registered trademarks of the 
Federal Reserve Banks.
    \38\ The Reserve Banks are preparing to deliver services to the 
industry via Application Programming Interfaces (API). APIs are a 
set of protocols for connecting software systems programmatically, 
enabling system-to-system interoperability. Communication will be 
forthcoming on timing, availability, and pricing of initial APIs.
    \39\ Attended packages require manual processes compared to 
automation of payment and information services offered by unattended 
packages. The Reserve Banks will continue to update pricing to 
differentiate the value proposition offered by attended and 
unattended packages.
---------------------------------------------------------------------------

    In order to continue to support FedMail Services, the Reserve Banks 
will increase the monthly fees for the FedMail Email Service from $85 
to $100 and increase the monthly fee for the FedMail Service from $85 
to $100. The FedMail Email Service is available [agrave] la carte only 
for FedLine Web or higher packages. FedMail is a legacy service, and 
the fee increases are to incentivize customers to migrate to more 
contemporary, online solutions such as FedLine Web. This is part of the 
Reserve Banks' multiyear effort to provide highly secure, modern access 
solutions, and value-added services not available on legacy technology.
    The FedLine Web solution offers access to core information services 
as well as check payment services. The Reserve Banks will create a new 
pricing tier for FedLine Web called FedLine Web Premier for a monthly 
fee of $200. Automation of payments and informational services is 
available through FedLine Command and FedLine Direct packages, so 
credentialing a customer who desires check payment automation via 
FedLine Web requires a manual exception process by the FRFS Support 
Center. The Reserve Banks proposed the new pricing tier to reflect the 
cost of credentialing users and the value check files automation 
technology provides to payment services not offered by attended 
services such as FedLine Web and FedLine Web Plus.
    The introduction of the FedNow Service requires multiple 
enhancements, such as 7-Day Accounting, that have been made to the 
Accounting Information Services (AIS). The Reserve Banks will increase 
prices for the AIS to reflect the enhancement value as well as to 
incent customers toward automated channels that better address their 
needs. Specifically, the Reserve Banks will increase the following 
fees:

CMS Plus Own Report plus OSRTN, Respondents  from $1,000 to $1,200.
 and Subaccounts--Up to 12 files with over
 500 OSRTNs, Respondents and Subaccounts.
------------------------------------------------------------------------

    The Reserve Banks estimate that the above price changes will result 
in an average 2.7 percent price increase for customers.

II. Analysis of Competitive Effect

    All operational and legal changes considered by the Board that have 
a substantial effect on payment system participants are subject to the 
competitive impact analysis described in the March 1990 policy ``The 
Federal Reserve in the Payments System.'' \40\ Under this policy, the 
Board assesses whether changes would have a direct and material adverse 
effect on the ability of other service providers to

[[Page 82368]]

compete effectively with the Federal Reserve in providing similar 
services because of differing legal powers or constraints or because of 
a dominant market position deriving from such legal differences. If any 
proposed changes create such an effect, the Board must further evaluate 
the changes to assess whether the benefits associated with the 
changes--such as contributions to payment system efficiency, payment 
system integrity, or other Board objectives--can be achieved while 
minimizing the adverse effect on competition.
---------------------------------------------------------------------------

    \40\ Federal Reserve Regulatory Service (FRRS) 9-1558.
---------------------------------------------------------------------------

    The 2024 fees, fee structures, and changes in service will not have 
a direct and material adverse effect on the ability of other service 
providers to compete effectively with the Reserve Banks in providing 
similar services. When conducting the competitive effect analysis for 
the FedNow Service, the Federal Reserve assessed whether its pricing 
strategy as a new service, including discounts, would have a material, 
adverse effect on the ability of other service providers to compete 
effectively with the Reserve Banks due to differing legal powers or a 
dominate market position as a result of such differing legal powers. 
The Board concluded that the pricing strategy, including discounts, 
followed general market practice for new services and could similarly 
be implemented by private sector providers unrelated to any differing 
legal powers. Therefore, the Reserve Banks' pricing does not have a 
material adverse effect on the ability of other service providers to 
compete effectively with the Reserve Banks in providing similar 
services.
    The Reserve Banks expect to continue to achieve aggregate long-run 
cost recovery across all mature priced services.

value and non-value item origination fees, and FedGlobal ACH 
origination surcharges.
    \42\ Any RDFI not originating forward value and non-value items 
and incurring less than $40 in receipt fees will be charged a 
variable amount to reach the minimum. Any RDFI that originates 
forward value and non-value items incurring less than $50 in forward 
value and nonvalue item origination fees will only be charged a 
variable amount to reach the minimum monthly origination fee.
    \43\ This surcharge is assessed on all forward items that 
qualify for same-day processing and settlement and is incremental to 
the standard origination item fee.
    \44\ The fee includes the item and addenda fees in addition to 
the conversion fee.
    \45\ The fee includes the item and addenda fees in addition to 
the conversion fee. Reserve Banks also assess a $45 fee for every 
government paper return/NOC they process.
    \46\ Origination volumes at these levels qualify for a waterfall 
discount that includes all FedACH origination items.
    \47\ Origination discounts based on monthly billed receipt 
volume apply only to those items received by FedACH receiving points 
and are available only to Premium Receivers.
    \48\ RDFIs receiving through FedACH less than 90 percent of 
their FedACH-originated items.
    \49\ This per-item discount is a reduction to the standard 
receipt fees listed in this fee schedule.

    \60\ Premier reports generated on demand are subject to the 
package/tiered fees plus a surcharge.
    \61\ The fee applies to RTNs that have received or originated 
FedACH transactions during a month. Institutions that receive only 
U.S. government transactions or that elect to use a private-sector 
operator exclusively are not assessed the fee.
    \62\ This surcharge is assessed to any RTN that originates at 
least one item meeting the criteria for same-day processing and 
settlement in a given month.
    \63\ The fee is applied to any RTN with activity during a month, 
including RTNs of institutions that elect to use a private-sector 
operator exclusively but also have items routed to or from customers 
that access the ACH network through FedACH. This fee does not apply 
to RTNs that use the Reserve Banks for only U.S. government 
transactions.

generated.
    \65\ Limited services are offered in contingency situations.

should they be assessed by foreign RDFIs or downstream payment 
participants.
    \73\ The monthly fee is rolled up to the parent DI level, such 
that a DI that opts into the FedACH Exception Resolution Service 
under two separate RTNs would pay a single monthly fee based on the 
total number of cases opened for their two RTNs combined.
    \74\ A financial institution may enroll in the Service as an 
Offline Service Participant by designating the Reserve Bank to 
access and use the functionality of the application on behalf of the 
Offline Participant.

discount program to financial institutions that receive at least 5

---------------------------------------------------------------------------

    \76\ The incentive discounts apply to the volume that exceeds 60 
percent of a customer's historic benchmark volume. Historic 
benchmark volume is based on a customer's average daily activity 
over the previous five calendar years. If a customer has fewer than 
five full calendar years of previous activity, its historic 
benchmark volume is based on its daily activity for as many full 
calendar years of data as are available. If a customer has less than 
one year of past activity, then the customer qualifies automatically 
for incentive discounts for the year. The applicable incentive 
discounts are as follows: $0.752 for transfers up to 14,000; $0.232 
for transfers 14,001 to 90,000; and $0.152 for transfers over 
90,000.

    \80\ Provided on billing statement for informational purposes 
only.
    \81\ This charge is assessed to settlement arrangements that use 
the Fedwire[supreg] Funds Service to affect the settlement of 
interbank obligations (as opposed to those that use the National 
Settlement Service). With respect to such special settlement 
arrangements, other charges may be assessed for each funds transfer 
into or out of the accounts used in connection with such 
arrangements.
    \82\ An organization that is a settlement agent may be able to 
use the National Settlement Service offline service if it is 
experiencing an operational event that prevents the transmission of 
settlement files via its electronic connection to the Federal 
Reserve Banks. The Federal Reserve Banks have limited capacity to 
process offline settlement files. As a result, while the Federal 
Reserve Banks use best efforts to process offline settlement file 
submissions, there is no guarantee that an offline settlement file, 
in particular one that is submitted late in the operating day or 
that contains a large number of entries, will be accepted for 
processing. Only those persons identified as authorized individuals 
on the National Settlement Service 04 Agent Contact Form may submit 
offline settlement files. For questions related to the National 
Settlement Service offline service, please contact National 
Settlement Service Central Support Service Staff (CSSS) at 800-758-
9403, or via email at <a href="/cdn-cgi/l/email-protection#472434343469343326212107293e6921352569283520"><span class="__cf_email__" data-cfemail="64071717174a1710050202240a1d4a0216064a0b1603">[email&#160;protected]</span></a>.
    \83\ Any settlement arrangement that accrues less than $60 
during a calendar month will be assessed a variable amount to reach 
the minimum monthly fee.
