SECURITIES AND EXCHANGE COMMISSION

[Release No. 34-100547; File No. 10-244]


Self-Regulatory Organizations; Green Impact Exchange, LLC; Notice 
of Filing of Application for Registration as a National Securities 
Exchange Under Section 6 of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934

July 17, 2024.
    On May 9, 2024, Green Impact Exchange, LLC (``GIX'' or 
``Applicant'') submitted to the Securities and Exchange Commission 
(``Commission'') a Form 1 application under the

[[Page 59796]]

Securities Exchange Act of 1934 (``Exchange Act''), seeking 
registration as a national securities exchange under Section 6 of the 
Exchange Act.\1\ The Applicant's Form 1 application provides detailed 
information on how GIX proposes to satisfy the requirements of the 
Exchange Act.
---------------------------------------------------------------------------

    \1\ 15 U.S.C. 78f.
---------------------------------------------------------------------------

    The Commission is publishing this notice to solicit comments on 
GIX's Form 1 application. The Commission will take any comments it 
receives into consideration in making its determination about whether 
to grant GIX's request to be registered as a national securities 
exchange. The Commission will grant the registration if it finds that 
the requirements of the Exchange Act and the rules and regulations 
thereunder with respect to GIX are satisfied.\2\
---------------------------------------------------------------------------

    \2\ 15 U.S.C. 78s(a).
---------------------------------------------------------------------------

    GIX's Form 1 application states that GIX would be wholly owned by 
its parent company, Green Exchange, PBC (``GEPBC''). The Form 1 
application provides that GIX would operate a fully automated 
electronic trading platform for the trading of listed equities and 
would not maintain a physical trading floor. One feature of GIX's Form 
1 application is that GIX proposes to enter into an agreement with MEMX 
Technologies, LLC to license the technology underlying the GIX trading 
platform.\3\ The Form 1 application provides that liquidity would be 
derived from orders to buy and orders to sell submitted to GIX 
electronically by GIX members from remote locations. GIX proposes to 
have one class of membership open to registered broker-dealers. A novel 
feature of GIX's proposed listing standards is that GIX intends to 
require all companies that list on GIX to comply with its Green 
Governance Standards, which, according to GIX, will be designed to 
provide transparency and accountability for listed companies' green and 
sustainability promises and signal to investors focused on green 
practices that listed companies are credible.\4\
---------------------------------------------------------------------------

    \3\ See Exhibits C and E to GIX's Form 1 application.
    \4\ See proposed GIX Rule Series 14.425 (describing the Green 
Governance Standards).
---------------------------------------------------------------------------

    A more detailed description of the manner of operation of GIX's 
proposed system can be found in Exhibit E to GIX's Form 1 application. 
The proposed rulebook for the proposed exchange can be found in Exhibit 
B to GIX's Form 1 application, and the governing documents for GIX and 
GEPBC can be found in Exhibit A and Exhibit C to GIX's Form 1 
application. A listing of the officers and directors of GIX can be 
found in Exhibit J to GIX's Form 1 application. A complete set of forms 
concerning membership and access can be found in Exhibit F to GIX's 
Form 1 application. A discussion of GIX's Green Governance Standards 
and their consistency with the Exchange Act can be found in Exhibit H-5 
to GIX's Form 1 application.
    GIX's Form 1 application, including all of the Exhibits referenced 
above, is available online at <a href="http://www.sec.gov/rules/other.shtml">www.sec.gov/rules/other.shtml</a>. Interested 
persons are invited to submit written data, views, and arguments 
concerning GIX's Form 1 application, including whether the application 
is consistent with the Exchange Act.
