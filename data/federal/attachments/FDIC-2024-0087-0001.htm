    General Description of Collection. In 2008, the Office of the 
Comptroller of the Currency, the Board of Governors of the Federal 
Reserve System, and the FDIC issued a supervisory guidance document 
related to the supervisory review process of capital adequacy (Pillar 
2) in connection with the implementation of the Basel II Advanced 
Capital Framework. Sections 37, 41, 43, and 46 of the guidance include 
possible information collections. Section 37 provides that banks should 
state clearly the definition of capital used in any aspect of its 
internal capital adequacy assessment process (ICAAP) and document any 
changes in the internal definition of capital. Section 41 provides that 
banks should maintain thorough documentation of its ICAAP. Section 43 
specifies that the board of directors should approve the bank's ICAAP, 
review it on a regular basis and approve any changes. Section 46 
recommends that boards of directors periodically review the assessment 
of overall capital adequacy and analyze how measures of internal 
capital adequacy compare with other capital measures such as regulatory 
or accounting. There has been no change in the method or substance of 
this information collection, and the burden is unchanged from the 2021 
burden estimate.
