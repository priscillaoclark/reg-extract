Final Approval Under OMB Delegated Authority of the Extension for Three 
Years, Without Revision, of the Following Information Collection

    Collection title: Applications for Employment with the Board of 
Governors of the Federal Reserve System.
    Collection identifier: FR 28.
    OMB control number: 7100-0181.
    General description of collection: The FR 28 is comprised of the 
Application for Employment (FR 28a), Applicant's Voluntary Self-
Identification (FR 28s), Research Assistant Candidate Survey of 
Interests and Computer Experience (FR 28i), and Pre-Hire Conflict of 
Interest Screening Form (FR 28c).
    The Application for Employment (FR 28a) collects information to 
determine the qualifications of applicants for employment with the 
Board (such as education and training, employment record, and other 
information since the time the applicant left high school). Among other 
things, the FR 28a is used to examine, rate, or assess the applicant's 
qualifications, and to contact the applicant to arrange an interview. 
The Applicant's Voluntary Self-Identification (FR 28s) is an optional 
form that collects information on the applicant's gender, race, and 
ethnicity. The Research Assistant Candidate Survey of Interests and 
Computer Experience (FR 28i) collects information on a Research 
Assistant (RA) applicant's level of interest in various economic topics 
and experience in different data analytics/programs. The Pre-Hire 
Conflict of Interest Screening Form (FR 28c) collects information from 
external applicants after they have been selected for an interview at 
the Board regarding certain financial interests that could pose a 
conflict of interest based on the duties of the position for which they 
are applying.
    The information collected through the FR 28 is used to assist the 
Board in recruiting and hiring individuals for Board employment, 
retaining qualified employees, and periodically reviewing its hiring 
practices.
    Frequency: Event-generated.
    Respondents: Individuals seeking employment with the Board.
    Total estimated number of respondents: 17,150.
