defined in section 2(2) of the National Labor Relations Act (NLRA or

section 2(3) of the Act.

DATES: The comment periods for the notice of proposed rulemaking 
published September 7, 2022, at 87 FR 54641, are extended. Comments 
must be received by the Board on or before December 7, 2022, and reply

Relations Board, 1015 Half Street SE, Washington, DC 20570-0001.

delays in U.S. mail delivery. You should take this into consideration 
when preparing to meet the deadline for submitting comments. The Board

    Only comments submitted through <a href="https://www.regulations.gov">https://www.regulations.gov</a>, hand 
delivered, or mailed will be accepted; ex parte communications received 
by the Board will be made part of the rulemaking record and will be 
treated as comments only insofar as appropriate. Comments will be 
available for public inspection at <a href="https://www.regulations.gov">https://www.regulations.gov</a> and 
during normal business hours (8:30 a.m. to 5 p.m. EST) at the above

Board requests that comments include full citations or internet links 
to any authority relied upon. The Board cautions commenters not to 
include personal information such as Social Security numbers, personal 
addresses, telephone numbers, and email addresses in their comments, as 
such submitted information will become viewable by the public via the

number), 1-866-315-6572 (TTY/TDD).

SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION: The proposed changes are designed to 
explicitly ground the joint-employer standard in established common-law

the Act regarding their rights and responsibilities when more than one 
statutory employer possesses the authority to control or exercises the 
power to control particular employees' essential terms and conditions 
of employment.

Roxanne L. Rothschild,
Executive Secretary.
