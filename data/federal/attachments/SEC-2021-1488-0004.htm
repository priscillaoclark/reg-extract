SECURITIES AND EXCHANGE COMMISSION

[SEC File No. 270-028, OMB Control No. 3235-0032]


Submission for OMB Review; Comment Request; Extension: Rule 17f-
1(b)

Upon Written Request, Copies Available From: Securities and Exchange 
Commission, Office of FOIA Services, 100 F Street NE, Washington, DC 
20549-2736

    Notice is hereby given that pursuant to the Paperwork Reduction Act 
of 1995 (``PRA'') (44 U.S.C. 3501 et seq.), the Securities and Exchange 
Commission (``Commission'') has submitted to the Office of Management 
and Budget (``OMB'') a request for approval of extension of the 
previously approved collection of information provided for in Rule 17f-
1(b) (17 CFR 240.17f-1(b)), under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 
(15 U.S.C. 78a et seq.).
    Under Rule 17f-1(b) under the Exchange Act, approximately 9,500 
entities in the securities industry are registered in the Lost and 
Stolen Securities Program (``Program''). Registration fulfills a 
statutory requirement that entities report and inquire about missing, 
lost, counterfeit, or stolen securities. Registration also allows 
entities in the securities industry to gain access to a confidential 
database that stores information for the Program.
    The Commission staff estimates that 4 new entities will register in 
the Program each year. The staff estimates that the average number of 
hours necessary to comply with Rule 17f-1(b) is one-half hour. 
Accordingly, the staff estimates that the total annual burden for all 
participants is 2 hours (4 x one-half hour). The Commission staff 
estimates that compliance staff work at subject entities results in an 
internal cost of compliance, at an estimated hourly wage of $344, of 
$172 per year per entity (.5 hours x $344 per hour = $172 per year). 
Therefore, the aggregate annual internal cost of compliance is 
approximately $688 ($172 x 4= $688).
    An agency may not conduct or sponsor, and a person is not required 
to respond to, a collection of information under the PRA unless it 
displays a currently valid OMB control number.
