I. Description and Purpose of the Amendment

    The Plan requires the options exchanges to establish a framework 
for providing order protection and addressing locked and crossed 
markets in eligible options classes. The amendment to the Plan adds 
MIAX Sapphire as a Participant. The other Plan Participants are BATS, 
BOX, BX, C2, CBOE, EDGX, Emerald, ISE, ISE Gemini, ISE Mercury, MEMX, 
MIAX, Nasdaq, Pearl, Phlx, NYSE MKT, and NYSE Arca. MIAX Sapphire has 
submitted an executed copy of the Plan to the Commission in accordance 
with the procedures set forth in the Plan regarding new Participants. 
Section 3(c) of the Plan provides for the entry of new Participants to 
the Plan. Specifically, Section 3(c) of the Plan provides that an 
Eligible Exchange \5\ may become a

[[Page 65468]]

Participant in the Plan by: (i) executing a copy of the Plan, as then 
in effect; (ii) providing each current Participant with a copy of such 
executed Plan; and (iii) effecting an amendment to the Plan, as 
specified in Section 4(b) of the Plan.\6\
---------------------------------------------------------------------------

    \5\ Section 2(6) of the Plan defines an ``Eligible Exchange'' as 
a national securities exchange registered with the Commission 
pursuant to Section 6(a) of the Act, 15 U.S.C. 78f(a), that: (a) is 
a ``Participant Exchange'' in the Options Clearing Corporation 
(``OCC'') (as defined in OCC By-laws, Section VII); (b) is a party 
to the Options Price Reporting Authority (``OPRA'') Plan (as defined 
in the OPRA Plan, Section 1); and (c) if the national securities 
exchange chooses not to become part to this Plan, is a participant 
in another plan approved by the Commission providing for comparable 
Trade-Through and Locked and Crossed Market protection. MIAX 
Sapphire has represented that it has met the requirements for being 
considered an Eligible Exchange. See letter from Gregory P. Ziegler, 
Vice President and Senior Counsel, MIAX Sapphire, to Vanessa 
Countryman, Secretary, Commission, dated July 30, 2024.
    \6\ MIAX Sapphire has represented that it has executed a copy of 
the current Plan, amended to include MIAX Sapphire as a Participant 
and has sent each current Participant a copy of the executed Plan. 
See letter from Gregory P. Ziegler, Vice President and Senior 
Counsel, MIAX Sapphire, to Vanessa Countryman, Secretary, 
Commission, dated July 30, 2024.
---------------------------------------------------------------------------

    Section 4(b) of the Plan sets forth the process by which an 
Eligible Exchange may effect an amendment to the Plan. Specifically, an 
Eligible Exchange must: (a) execute a copy of the Plan with the only 
change being the addition of the new Participant's name in Section 3(a) 
of the Plan; and (b) submit the executed Plan to the Commission. The 
Plan then provides that such an amendment will be effective when the 
amendment is approved by the Commission or otherwise becomes effective 
pursuant to Section 11A of the Act and Rule 608 thereunder.

II. Effectiveness of the Proposed Linkage Plan Amendment

    The foregoing Plan amendment has become effective pursuant to Rule 
608(b)(3)(iii) \7\ because it has been designated as involving solely 
technical or ministerial matters. At any time within sixty days of the 
filing of this amendment, the Commission may summarily abrogate the 
amendment and require that it be refiled pursuant to paragraph (a)(1) 
of Rule 608,\8\ if it appears to the Commission that such action is 
necessary or appropriate in the public interest, for the protection of 
investors, or the maintenance of fair and orderly markets, to remove 
impediments to, and perfect the mechanisms of, a national market system 
or otherwise in furtherance of the purposes of the Act.
