the Committee's section of the Department of the Treasury website, has 
determined, under the authority of section 721 of the Defense 
Production Act of 1950, as amended, and 31 CFR 802.1001(a), that: (1) 
New Zealand has made significant progress toward establishing and 
effectively utilizing a robust process to analyze foreign investments 
for national security risks and to facilitate coordination with the 
United States on matters relating to investment security; and (2) the 
United Kingdom of Great Britain and Northern Ireland has made 
significant progress toward establishing and effectively utilizing a 
robust process to analyze foreign investments for national security 
risks and to facilitate coordination with the United States on matters 
relating to investment security.

of excepted real estate foreign state under 31 CFR 802.214 with respect 
to New Zealand and the United Kingdom of Great Britain and Northern 
Ireland. Therefore, New Zealand and the United Kingdom of Great Britain 
and Northern Ireland are and will remain excepted real estate foreign 
states absent further Committee action and notice in the Federal 
Register.

Assistant Secretary for Investment Security.
