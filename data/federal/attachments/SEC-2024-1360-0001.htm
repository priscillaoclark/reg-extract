Secondary Market Transactions in U.S. Treasury Securities

September 18, 2024.
    On March 11, 2024, Fixed Income Clearing Corporation (``FICC'') 
filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission (``Commission'') the 
proposed rule change SR-FICC-2024-005 pursuant to Section 19(b) of the 
Securities Exchange Act of 1934 (``Exchange Act'') \1\ and Rule 19b-4 
\2\ thereunder to modify FICC's Government Securities Division 
(``GSD'') Rulebook (``GSD Rules'') to facilitate access to clearance 
and settlement services of all eligible secondary market transactions 
in U.S. Treasury securities.\3\ On March 19, 2024, FICC filed Partial 
Amendment No. 1 to make clarifications and corrections \4\ to the

    \4\ Partial Amendment No. 1 made clarifications and corrections 
to the description of the proposed rule change and Exhibit 5. 
Specifically, as originally filed, the description of the proposed 
rule change made a reference to an incorrect section of the GSD 
Rules. Partial Amendment No. 1 corrects that reference. 
Additionally, as originally filed, the description of the proposed 
rule change and Exhibit 5 contained inconsistent references 
regarding whether FICC or its Board would be responsible for 
approving membership applications and related membership matters. 
Partial Amendment No. 1 clarifies and corrects those references.

19(b)(2)(B)(ii)(II) of the Exchange Act,\13\ the Commission designates
