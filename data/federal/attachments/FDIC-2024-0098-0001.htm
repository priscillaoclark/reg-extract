FEDERAL DEPOSIT INSURANCE CORPORATION

12 CFR Part 328

RIN 3064-AF26


FDIC Official Signs and Advertising Requirements, False 
Advertising, Misrepresentation of Insured Status, and Misuse of the 
FDIC's Name or Logo

AGENCY: Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation (FDIC).

ACTION: Final rule; delay of compliance date.

-----------------------------------------------------------------------

SUMMARY: On December 20, 2023, the FDIC adopted a final rule that, 
among other things, amended the FDIC's sign and advertising 
requirements for insured depository institutions (IDIs). The amendments 
made by the final rule took effect on April 1, 2024; however, full 
compliance with the amendments was extended to January 1, 2025.
    The FDIC is delaying the compliance date for the new sign and 
advertising requirements for IDIs in the final rule to May 1, 2025. 
This delay will provide additional opportunity for IDIs to establish 
processes and systems, and make technological updates, necessary to 
implement the new regulatory requirements.

DATES: The compliance date for the amendments to subpart A of 12 CFR 
part 328 in the final rule published at 89 FR 3504 on January 18, 2024, 
is delayed to May 1, 2025.

SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION: On December 20, 2023, the FDIC Board of 
Directors adopted a final rule revising the sign and advertising 
regulations implementing section 18(a) of the Federal Deposit Insurance 
Act.\1\ On January 18, 2024 (89 FR 3504), the final rule was published 
in the Federal Register.
---------------------------------------------------------------------------

    \1\ 12 U.S.C. 1828(a).
---------------------------------------------------------------------------

    The final rule became effective on April 1, 2024, and required full 
compliance with the rule by January 1, 2025. Based upon feedback from 
IDIs

[[Page 84262]]

and other banking industry participants, the FDIC understands that some 
IDIs would find it beneficial to have additional time beyond the 
January 1, 2025, compliance date to implement the new regulatory 
requirements under subpart A of 12 CFR part 328. In particular, some 
IDIs have reported they continue to update online systems and 
platforms, and have requested additional time to meet the new 
requirements under subpart A. To provide additional opportunity for 
IDIs to put in place processes and systems, and make technological 
updates, the FDIC is delaying the compliance date for amendments to 
subpart A of 12 CFR part 328 from January 1, 2025, to May 1, 2025. The 
compliance date for the final rule amendments to subpart B of 12 CFR 
part 328 remains January 1, 2025.
    The FDIC has also received a number of questions from industry 
participants regarding the application of the new requirements. In 
response, the FDIC has published two sets of ``Questions and Answers'' 
\2\ addressing certain issues raised by industry participants. The FDIC 
has continued to receive requests for additional clarity. The FDIC will 
continue to evaluate questions that have been received and will 
endeavor to make any additional potential ``Questions and Answers'' 
publicly available by November 30, 2024, to facilitate effective 
compliance by the May 1, 2025, compliance date.
