SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION: Pursuant to the Export-Import Bank Act of 
1945, as amended (12 U.S.C. 635, et seq.), the Export-Import Bank of 
the United States (EXIM), facilitates the finance of the export of U.S. 
goods and services by providing insurance or guarantees to U.S. 
exporters or lenders financing U.S. exports. By neutralizing the effect 
of export credit insurance or guarantees offered by foreign governments 
and by absorbing credit risks that the private sector will not accept, 
EXIM enables U.S. exporters to compete fairly in foreign markets on the 
basis of price and product. In the event that a borrower defaults on a 
transaction insured or guaranteed by EXIM, the insured or guaranteed 
exporter or lender may seek payment from EXIM by the submission of a 
claim.
    Title and Form Number: EIB 10-05 Notice of Claim and Proof of Loss,
