lending practices in the U.S. loan markets. A portion of each survey 
typically covers special topics of timely interest.
    Frequency: Quarterly.

branches and agencies of foreign banks. Other types of respondents 
(such as other depository institutions, bank holding companies, or 
other financial entities) may also be surveyed if appropriate.
