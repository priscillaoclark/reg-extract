SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION: 
    Title: Notification of Pending Legal Proceedings Pursuant to 17 CFR 
1.60 (OMB Control Number 3038-0033). This is a request for extension of 
a currently approved information collection.
    Abstract: Rule 1.60 of the Commission's Part 1 regulations requires 
every designated contract market (``DCM'') and futures commission 
merchant (``FCM'') to submit to the Commodity Futures Trading 
Commission (``Commission'') certain specified information concerning 
pending legal proceedings to which the DCM or FCM is a party or to 
which its property is subject. Rule 37.2 of the same part makes the 
requirement of 1.60 applicable to swap execution facilities (``SEFs''). 
This renewal updates the total requested burden based on available 
reported data.
    The Commission originally estimated that 101 entities would be 
affected by this rule. That number was based on the number of active 
registrants, including 62 FCMs,18 DCMs, and 21 SEFs.
    An agency may not conduct or sponsor, and a person is not required 
to respond to, a collection of information unless it displays a 
currently valid OMB control number.\2\ On September 13, 2024, the 
Commission published in the Federal Register notice of the proposed 
extension of this information collection and provided 60 days for 
public comment on the proposed extension, 89 FR 74930 (``60-Day 
Notice''). The Commission did not receive any comments on the 60-Day 
Notice.
---------------------------------------------------------------------------

    \2\ 44 U.S.C. 3512, 5 CFR 1320.5(b)(2)(i) and 1320.8(b)(3)(vi). 
The OMB control numbers for the CFTC regulations were published on 
December 30, 1981. See 46 FR 63035 (Dec. 30, 1981).
---------------------------------------------------------------------------

    Burden Statement: The respondent burden for this collection is 
estimated to average 0.25 hours per response, once annually. This 
estimate includes providing the Commission with notice and copies of 
specified legal documents.
    Estimated Number of Respondents: 101.
    Estimated Average Burden Hours per Respondent: 0.25.
    Estimated Total Annual Burden Hours: 25.25.
    Frequency of Collection: Once annually.
    There are no capital costs or operating and maintenance costs 
associated with this collection.

(Authority: 44 U.S.C. 3501 et seq.)

    Dated: November 20, 2024.

Deputy Secretary of the Commission.
