SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION:

A. Need For and Use of the Information Collection

    Section 10b of the Federal Home Loan Bank Act (Bank Act) 
establishes the requirements for making Federal Home Loan Bank (Bank) 
advances (secured loans) to nonmember mortgagees, which are referred to 
as ``Housing Associates'' in FHFA's regulations.\1\ Section 10b also 
establishes the eligibility requirements an applicant must meet in 
order to be certified as a Housing Associate.
---------------------------------------------------------------------------

    \1\ See 12 U.S.C. 1430b; 12 CFR 1264.3.
---------------------------------------------------------------------------

    Part 1264 of FHFA's regulations implements the statutory 
eligibility requirements and establishes uniform review criteria the 
Banks must use in evaluating applications from entities that wish to be 
certified as a Housing Associate. Specifically, Sec.  1264.4 implements 
the statutory eligibility requirements and provides guidance to an 
applicant on how it may satisfy those requirements.\2\ Section 1264.5 
authorizes the Banks to approve or deny all applications for 
certification as a Housing Associate, subject to the statutory and 
regulatory requirements.\3\ Section 1264.6 permits an applicant that 
has been denied certification by a Bank to appeal that decision to 
FHFA.\4\
---------------------------------------------------------------------------

    \2\ See 12 CFR 1264.4.
    \3\ See 12 CFR 1264.5.
    \4\ See 12 CFR 1264.6.
---------------------------------------------------------------------------

    Subpart B of 12 CFR part 1266 governs Bank advances to Housing 
Associates that have been approved under 12 CFR part 1264. Section 
1266.17 establishes the terms and conditions under which a Bank may 
make advances to Housing Associates.\5\ Specifically, Sec.  1266.17(e) 
imposes a continuing obligation on each certified Housing Associate to 
provide information necessary for the Bank to determine if it remains 
in compliance with applicable statutory and regulatory requirements, as 
set forth in part 1264.
---------------------------------------------------------------------------

    \5\ See 12 CFR 1266.17.
---------------------------------------------------------------------------

    The OMB control number for the information collection, which 
expires on June 30, 2022, is 2590-0001. The likely respondents include 
entities applying to be certified as a Housing Associate and current 
Housing Associates.

B. Burden Estimates

    FHFA estimates the total annualized hour burden imposed upon 
respondents by this information collection to be 306 hours (14 hours 
for applicants + 292 hours for current Housing Associates), based on 
the following calculations:

I. Applicants

    FHFA estimates that the total annual average number of entities 
applying to be certified as a Housing Associate over the next three 
years will be one, with one response per applicant. The estimate for 
the average hours per application is 14 hours. Therefore, the estimate 
for the total annual hour burden for all applicants is 14 hours (1 
applicant x 1 response per applicant x 14 hours = 14 hours).

II. Current Housing Associates

    FHFA estimates that the total annual average number of existing 
Housing Associates over the next three years will be 73, with one 
response per Housing Associate required to comply with the regulatory 
reporting requirements. The estimate for the average hours per response 
is 4 hours. Therefore, the estimate for the total annual hour burden 
for current Housing Associates is 292 hours (73 certified Housing 
Associates x 1 response per associate x 4 hours = 292 hours).

C. Comments Request

    FHFA requests written comments on the following: (1) Whether the 
collection of information is necessary for the proper performance of 
FHFA functions, including whether the information has practical 
utility; (2) the accuracy of FHFA's estimates of the burdens of the 
collection of information; (3) ways to enhance the quality, utility, 
and clarity of the information collected; and (4) ways to minimize the 
burden of the collection of information on respondents, including 
through the use of automated collection techniques or other forms of 
information technology.
