SECURITIES AND EXCHANGE COMMISSION

[SEC File No. 270-035, OMB Control No. 3235-0029]


Proposed Collection; Comment Request; Extension: Rule 17f-2(c)

Upon Written Request, Copies Available From: Securities and Exchange 
Commission, Office of FOIA Services, 100 F Street NE, Washington, DC 
20549-2736

    Notice is hereby given that pursuant to the Paperwork Reduction Act 
of 1995 (``PRA'') (44 U.S.C. 3501 et seq.), the Securities and Exchange 
Commission (``Commission'') is soliciting comments on the existing 
collection of information provided for in Rule 17f-2(c) (17 CFR 
240.17f-2(c)), under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 (15 U.S.C. 78a 
et seq.). The Commission plans to submit this existing collection of 
information to the Office of Management and Budget (``OMB'') for 
extension and approval.
    Rule 17f-2(c) allows persons required to be fingerprinted pursuant 
to Section 17(f)(2) of the Act to submit their fingerprints to the 
Attorney General of the United States or its designee (i.e., the 
Federal Bureau of Investigation (``FBI'')) through a registered 
national securities exchange or a registered national securities 
association (collectively, also known as ``self-regulatory 
organizations'' or ``SROs'') pursuant to a fingerprint plan filed with, 
and declared effective by, the Commission. Fingerprint plans have been 
declared effective for the American, Boston, Chicago, New York, and 
Philadelphia stock exchanges and for the Financial Industry Regulatory 
Authority (``FINRA'') and the Chicago Board Options Exchange. 
Currently, FINRA accounts for the bulk of the fingerprint submissions.
    It is estimated that 3,800 respondents submit approximately 278,455 
sets of fingerprints (consisting of approximately 258,646 electronic 
sets and 19,809 hard copy sets) to SROs on an annual basis. The 
Commission estimates that it takes approximately 15 minutes to create 
and submit each fingerprint card. The total time burden is therefore 
estimated to be approximately 69,614 hours per year.
    In addition, the SROs charge an estimated $31 fee for processing 
fingerprint cards submitted electronically, resulting in a total annual 
cost to all 3,800 respondents of approximately $8,018,026 per year. The 
SROs charge an estimated $41 fee for processing fingerprint cards 
submitted in hard copy, resulting in a total annual

[[Page 48477]]

cost to all 3,800 respondents of approximately $812,169 per year. The 
combined cost to all respondents is thus approximately $8,830,195 per 
year.
    Because the FBI will not accept fingerprint cards directly from 
submitting organizations, Commission approval of fingerprint plans from 
certain SROs is essential to carry out the Congressional goal to 
fingerprint securities industry personnel. Filing these plans for 
review assures users and their personnel that fingerprint cards will be 
handled responsibly and with due care for confidentiality.
    Written comments are invited on: (a) whether the proposed 
collection of information is necessary for the proper performance of 
the functions of the Commission, including whether the information 
shall have practical utility; (b) the accuracy of the Commission's 
estimates of the burden of the proposed collection of information; (c) 
ways to enhance the quality, utility, and clarity of the information 
collected; and (d) ways to minimize the burden of the collection of 
information on respondents, including through the use of automated 
collection techniques or other forms of information technology. 
Consideration will be given to comments and suggestions submitted by 
August 5, 2024.
    An agency may not conduct or sponsor, and a person is not required 
to respond to, a collection of information under the PRA unless it 
displays a currently valid OMB control number.
    Please direct your written comments to: David Bottom, Director/
Chief Information Officer, Securities and Exchange Commission, c/o John 
Pezzullo, 100 F Street NE, Washington, DC 20549, or send an email to:

    Dated: June 3, 2024.
Sherry R. Haywood,
Assistant Secretary.
