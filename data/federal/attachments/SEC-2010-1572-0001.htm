I. Self-Regulatory Organization's Statement of the Terms of Substance 
of the Proposed Rule Change

    The Exchange is proposing to amend BYX Rule 11.8, which relates to 
the obligations of market makers registered with BYX (``Market 
Makers'').
    The text of the proposed rule change is available at the Exchange's 
Web site at <A HREF="http://frwebgate.access.gpo.gov/cgi-bin/leaving.cgi?from=leavingFR.html&log=linklog&to=http://www.batstrading.com">http://www.batstrading.com</A>, at the principal office of the 
Exchange, and at the Commission's Public Reference Room.

II. Self-Regulatory Organization's Statement of the Purpose of, and 
Statutory Basis for, the Proposed Rule Change

    In its filing with the Commission, the Exchange included statements 
concerning the purpose of and basis for the proposed rule change and 
discussed any comments it received on the proposed rule change. The 
text of these statements may be examined at the places specified in 
Item IV below. The Exchange has prepared summaries, set forth in 
Sections A, B, and C below, of the most significant parts of such 
statements.

A. Self-Regulatory Organization's Statement of the Purpose of, and 
Statutory Basis for, the Proposed Rule Change

1. Purpose
    The Exchange proposes to adopt rules to enhance minimum quotation 
requirements for market makers. Under the proposal, the Exchange will 
require market makers for each stock in which they are registered to 
continuously maintain a two-sided quotation within a designated 
percentage of the National Best Bid (``NBB'') and National Best Offer 
(``NBO'') (or, if there is no NBB or NBO, the last reported sale). 
These enhanced market maker quotation requirements are intended to 
eliminate trade executions against market maker placeholder quotations 
traditionally priced far away from the inside market, commonly known as 
``stub quotes.'' They are also intended to augment and work in relation 
to the single stock pause standards already in place on a pilot basis 
for stocks in the S&P 500[supreg] Index,\3\ the Russell 1000[supreg] 
Index, as well as a pilot list of Exchange Traded Products.\4\
---------------------------------------------------------------------------

    \3\ See, e.g., Securities Exchange Act Release No. 62340 (June 
21, 2010), 75 FR 36768 (June 28, 2010) (SR-BATS-2010-014). The 
Exchange is separately working to amend its rules prior to 
commencement of operations to make clear that it will pause trading 
in Circuit Breaker Securities when an individual stock trading pause 
is issued by a primary listing market.
    \4\ See, e.g., Securities Exchange Act Release No. 62884 
(September 10, 2010), 75 FR 56618 (September 16, 2010) (SR-BATS-
2010-018); see id.
---------------------------------------------------------------------------

    Under the proposal, the Exchange will require registered market 
makers to enter and maintain quotes priced at no more than a certain 
percentage away from the national inside bid and offer. Permissible 
quotes are determined by the individual character of the security, the 
time of day in which the quote is entered, and other factors which are 
summarized below.
    For issues subject to an individual stock trading pause, a 
permissible quote is determined by first looking at the applicable 
individual stock pause trigger percentage of the security and then 
reducing that number by 2%. Since currently the individual stock pause 
trigger percentage utilized by the primary listing markets is 10%, a 
market maker's quote in a [sic] such a security may not be more than 8% 
away from the NBBO as appropriate. Once a compliant quote is entered, 
it may rest without adjustment until such time as it moves to within 
\1/2\ of 1% of the applicable stock pause trigger percentage (i.e., 
currently 9.5%) whereupon the market maker must immediately move its 
quote back to at least the permissible default level of 8% away from 
the NBBO. During times in which a stock pause trigger percentage is not 
applicable (e.g., before 9:45 a.m. and after 3:35 p.m.), a market maker 
must maintain a quote no further than 20% away from the inside (i.e., 
it may rest without adjustment until it reaches 21.5%). In the absence 
of a NBB or NBO, the above calculations will remain the same, but will 
use the national last sale instead of the absent bid or offer.
    For securities not subject to any individual stock trading pause, 
the proposal will a [sic] assume a hypothetical 32% stock pause trigger 
percentage, apply a 2% reduction, and require market makers in those 
issues to maintain quotes no more than 30% away from the NBBO. Like 
securities subject to stock trading pauses, once a compliant quote is 
entered, it may rest without adjustment until such time as it moves to 
within \1/2\ of 1% of its applicable pause trigger percentage (31.5%) 
whereupon the market maker must immediately move its quote back to at 
least the permissible default level of 30%. These requirements shall 
apply to Regulation NMS securities during normal market hours.
    Nothing in the above precludes a market maker from voluntarily 
quoting at price levels that are closer to the NBBO than required under 
the proposal.
    The Exchange proposes to offer optional functionality to Exchange 
Market Makers to assist such Market Makers with the quotation 
obligations proposed by this filing. Specifically, at 9 a.m. Eastern 
Time, the Exchange will extract information submitted by the Market 
Maker that provides specific quote instructions for the Exchange to 
enter a quote on the Market Maker's behalf consistent with proposed 
paragraph (d). The Exchange proposes to enter the initial bid and offer 
at the Designated Percentage and to cancel and replace the bid or offer 
if it drifts away from the NBBO to the Defined Limit or away from the 
Designated Percentage towards the NBBO by a number of percentage points 
determined by the Exchange. The Exchange will determine and publish 
this percentage in a circular distributed to Members from time to time; 
the Exchange wishes to retain this flexibility in the event it wishes 
to modify the number periodically in the future, for instance, to 
mitigate the amount of quotation information resulting from Exchange 
generated Market Maker quotes. If a bid or offer entered pursuant to 
proposed paragraph (e) is executed, the Exchange will re-enter a new 
bid or offer on behalf of a Market Maker. Bids and offers entered by 
the Exchange consistent with proposed paragraph (e) to replace a 
cancelled or executed quotation will be entered at the Designated 
Percentage away from the NBBO. Such orders will be posted by the 
Exchange as BATS Only Orders,\5\ and will be maintained on the Exchange 
during Regular Trading Hours \6\ unless cancelled by the Market Maker 
pursuant to the Exchange's Rules. In the event a Market Maker cancels 
the quotations entered by the Exchange in accordance with proposed 
paragraph (e), such Market Maker remains responsible for compliance 
with the requirements of paragraph (d).
---------------------------------------------------------------------------

    \5\ As defined in Rule 11.9(c)(4).
    \6\ Defined in Rule 1.5(w) as 9:30 a.m. to 4:00 p.m. Eastern 
Time.
---------------------------------------------------------------------------

    In order to adopt the above-described market maker quotation 
obligations, the Exchange proposes to modify Rule 11.18(a)(1), which 
currently contains a two-sided quotation obligation, to cross-reference 
the above-described market maker quotation obligations in new

[[Page 63530]]

paragraph (d). In addition, because proposed paragraph (d) makes clear 
that the obligations of that paragraph apply during Regular Trading 
Hours, the Exchange proposes to delete paragraph (b) of current Rule 
11.8 related to the [sic] when the current quoting obligations apply. 
Finally, the Exchange proposes deletion of current Rule 11.8(e), 
related to temporary withdrawal, because Exchange Rule 11.5(d) already 
provides a Market Maker with the ability to withdraw his or her status 
as a Market Maker and Rule 11.7(b) already provides a Market Maker with 
the ability to terminate his or her registration in a security. The 
Exchange believes that these mechanisms are sufficient for a Market 
Maker to withdraw or terminate its registration in a security or as a 
Market Maker without the need for an additional provision related to 
withdrawal.
2. Statutory Basis
    The Exchange believes that its proposal is consistent with the 
requirements of the Act and the rules and regulations thereunder that 
are applicable to a national securities exchange, and, in particular, 
with the requirements of Section 6(b) of the Act.\7\ In particular, the 
proposed change is consistent with Section 6(b)(5) of the Act,\8\ 
because it would promote just and equitable principles of trade, remove 
impediments to, and perfect the mechanism of, a free and open market 
and a national market system, and, in general, protect investors and 
the public interest. The proposed rule change is also designed to 
support the principles of Section 11A(a)(1) \9\ of the Act in that it 
seeks to assure fair competition among brokers and dealers and among 
exchange markets. The Exchange believes that the proposed rule meets 
these requirements in that it promotes uniformity across markets 
concerning minimum market maker quotation requirements. The Exchange 
believes that the proposed optional functionality to assist Exchange 
Market Makers in maintaining continuous, two-sided limit orders in the 
securities in which they are registered will encourage Market Makers to 
remain registered with and trade on the Exchange, thus providing 
valuable liquidity to the Exchange; at the same time, the Exchange 
believes that the proposed functionality will keep Exchange generated 
quotations within reasonable reach of the NBBO and that the elimination 
of ``stub quotes'' is important for the protection of investors and the 
public interest.
