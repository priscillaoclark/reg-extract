SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION:

Background

    On April 24, 2024, the President signed into law the 21st Century 
Peace through Strength Act, Public Law 118-50, div. D (the ``Act''). 
Section 3111 of the Act extended from five years to 10 years the 
statute of limitations for civil and criminal violations of the 
International Emergency Economic Powers Act, 50 U.S.C. 1701 et seq. 
(IEEPA), and the Trading with the Enemy Act, 50 U.S.C. 4301 et seq. 
(TWEA). Prior to the Act's enactment, civil enforcement actions brought 
by OFAC under IEEPA or TWEA were subject to the five-year statute of 
limitations set forth in 28 U.S.C. 2462. The new 10-year statute of 
limitations--codified at 50 U.S.C. 1705(d) and 4315(d)--became 
effective upon the President's signature of the Act on April 24, 2024. 
This new 10-year statute of limitations applies to any violation that 
was not time-barred at the time of its enactment. Consequently, OFAC 
may now commence an enforcement action for civil violations of IEEPA- 
or TWEA-based sanctions prohibitions within 10 years of the latest date 
of the violation if such date was after April 24, 2019. As set forth in 
the Act, the commencement of a civil enforcement action includes the 
issuance of a pre-penalty notice or a finding of violation.
    To match the new statute of limitations period, OFAC is publishing 
this interim final rule extending from five years to 10 years the 
recordkeeping requirements codified at 31 CFR 501.601, paragraph IV.B 
of appendix A to part 501, and 515.572. OFAC is soliciting public 
comments for 30 days on this interim final rule.

Electronic Availability

    This document and additional information concerning OFAC are 
available on OFAC's website: <a href="https://ofac.treasury.gov">https://ofac.treasury.gov</a>.

Public Participation

    Because the amendment of the Regulations is a rule of agency 
procedure and involves a foreign affairs function, the provisions of 
Executive Order 12866 of September 30, 1993, ``Regulatory Planning and 
Review'' (58 FR 51735, October 4, 1993), as amended, and the 
Administrative Procedure Act (5 U.S.C. 553) requiring notice of 
proposed rulemaking, opportunity for public participation, and delay in 
effective date are inapplicable. Because no notice of proposed 
rulemaking is required for this rule, the Regulatory Flexibility Act (5 
U.S.C. 601-612) does not apply.

Paperwork Reduction Act

    Pursuant to the Paperwork Reduction Act of 1995 (44 U.S.C. 3507), 
the collections of information related to 31 CFR 501.601, paragraph 
IV.B of appendix A to part 501, and 515.572 have been previously 
approved by the Office of Management and Budget (OMB) under control 
number 1505-0164. This final rule modifies the requirements for 
recordkeeping under these sections by increasing the period for 
recordkeeping to 10 years from five years to align with a statutory 
amendment. This modification to this collection of information, as well 
as an unrelated consolidation of certain OFAC information collections, 
will be submitted to OMB for review under control number 1505-0164. 
Written comments and recommendations for the modified collection can be 
submitted by visiting <a href="https://www.reginfo.gov/public/do/PRAMain">https://www.reginfo.gov/public/do/PRAMain</a>. Find 
this document by selecting ``Currently Under Review--Open for Public 
Comments'' or by using the search function. Comments are welcome and 
must be received by November 13, 2024.
    An agency may not conduct or sponsor, and a person is not required 
to respond to, a collection of information unless the collection of 
information displays a valid control number. The likely filers and 
record-keepers affected by these collections of information contained 
in 31 CFR part 501 are financial institutions, business organizations, 
nonprofit organizations, individuals, households, non-governmental 
organizations, and legal representatives.
    The burden of the recordkeeping requirement imposed by this rule is 
minimal because the records required to be maintained are likely 
maintained under standard business practice. The recent increase in the 
recordkeeping period to 10 years from five years could impose a 
temporary incremental burden on recordkeepers while they update their 
recordkeeping practices and adjust storage requirements to maintain 
records for a longer period of time. Accordingly, the total burden for 
this collection is estimated to be:
    Estimated Number of Respondents: 2,505,086.
    Frequency of Response: When requested by OFAC.
    Estimated Total Number of Annual Responses: 2,505,086.
    Estimated Time per Response: No additional time to retain records 
for additional time.
    Comments are invited on: (a) Whether the collection of information 
is necessary for the proper performance of the functions of the agency, 
including whether the information has practical utility; (b) the 
accuracy of the agency's estimate of the burden of the collection of 
information; (c) ways to enhance the quality, utility, and clarity of 
the information to be collected; (d) ways to minimize the burden of the 
collection of information on respondents, including through the use of 
automated collection techniques or other forms of information 
technology; and (e) estimates of capital or start-up costs and costs of 
operation, maintenance, and purchase of services required to provide 
information.
