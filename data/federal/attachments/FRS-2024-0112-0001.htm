Final Approval Under OMB Delegated Authority of the Extension for Three 
Years, With Revision, of the Following Information Collection

    Collection title: Reporting, Recordkeeping, and Disclosure 
Requirements Associated with Regulation WW.
    Collection identifier: FR WW.
    OMB control number: 7100-0367.
    Dates: The revisions are applicable as of April 26, 2024.
    General description of collection: The Board, Federal Deposit 
Insurance Corporation (FDIC), and Office of the Comptroller of the 
Currency (OCC) (collectively, the agencies) implemented a liquidity 
coverage ratio (LCR) requirement and a net stable funding ratio (NSFR) 
requirement, consistent with the international liquidity standards 
published by the Basel Committee on Banking Supervision (BCBS), for 
large and internationally active banking organizations. For the Board, 
these standards are implemented through Regulation WW--Liquidity Risk 
Measurement, Standards, and Monitoring (12 CFR part 249). The NSFR and 
LCR requirements in Regulation WW apply to certain large state member 
banks, covered depository institution holding companies, and U.S. 
intermediate holding companies of foreign banking organizations, as 
well as covered nonbank companies (together, covered companies). The 
reporting, recordkeeping, and disclosure requirements contained in FR 
WW are used to monitor covered companies' compliance with the LCR and 
NSFR.
    Frequency: The reporting requirements of the FR WW information 
collection are submitted on an event-generated basis. The recordkeeping 
requirements of the FR WW information collection are both event-
generated and ongoing. The disclosure requirements of the FR WW 
information collection must be met on a quarterly basis (relating to 
the LCR) as well as every second and fourth calendar quarter (relating 
to the NSFR) and must remain publicly available for at least five years 
after the initial disclosure date.
    Respondents: The FR WW panel comprises covered companies, as 
defined above. Certain requirements apply only to covered holding and 
nonbank companies.

    Total estimated number of respondents: 21.
    Total estimated change in burden: (446).
    Total estimated annual burden hours: 2,483.\1\

including more detailed burden estimates, can be found in the OMB 
Supporting Statement posted at <a href="https://www.federalreserve.gov/apps/reportingforms/review">https://www.federalreserve.gov/apps/reportingforms/review</a>. On the page displayed at the link, you can 
find the OMB Supporting Statement by referencing the collection 
identifier, FR WW.
---------------------------------------------------------------------------

    Current actions: On December 5, 2023, the Board published a notice 
in the Federal Register (88 FR 84328) requesting public comment for 60 
days on the extension, with revision, of the FR WW. The Board proposed 
to revise the FR WW to account for three recordkeeping requirements in 
Regulation WW, contained in section 249.4(a) and sections 249.22(a)(1) 
and (a)(4), which had not been previously cleared by the Board under 
the PRA. In addition, the Board revised the estimated hours per 
response for several requirements which lead to a net decrease in the 
total burden hours. The comment period for this notice expired on 
February 5, 2024. The Board did not receive any comments. The revisions 
will be implemented as proposed.

    Board of Governors of the Federal Reserve System, April 23, 
2024.
Michele Taylor Fennell,
Deputy Associate Secretary of the Board.
