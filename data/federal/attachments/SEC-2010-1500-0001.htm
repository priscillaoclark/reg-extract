SECURITIES AND EXCHANGE COMMISSION

 
Submission for OMB Review; Comment Request

Upon Written Request, Copies Available From: Securities and Exchange 
Commission, Office of Investor Education and Advocacy, Washington, DC 
20549-0213.


Extension:
    Regulation C; OMB Control No. 3235-0074; SEC File No. 270-68.

    Notice is hereby given that, pursuant to the Paperwork Reduction 
Act of 1995 (44 U.S.C. 3501 et seq.), the Securities and Exchange 
Commission (``Commission'') has submitted to the Office of Management 
and Budget the request for extension of the previously approved 
collection of information discussed below.
    Regulation C (17 CFR 230.400 through 230.498) provides standard 
instructions to guide persons when filing registration statements under 
the Securities Act of 1933 (15 U.S.C. 77a et seq.). The information 
collected is intended to ensure the adequacy of information available 
to investors in the registration of securities. The information 
provided is mandatory. Regulation C is assigned one burden hour for 
administrative convenience because it does not directly impose 
information collection requirements.
    An agency may not conduct or sponsor, and a person is not required 
to respond to, a collection of information unless it displays a 
currently valid control number.
    Written comments regarding the above information should be directed 
to the following persons: (i) Desk Officer for the Securities and 
Exchange Commission, Office of Information and Regulatory Affairs, 
Office of Management and Budget, Room 10102, New Executive Office 
Building, Washington, DC 20503; or send an e-mail to: <A HREF="mailto:Shagufta_Ahmed@omb.eop.gov">Shagufta_
Ahmed@omb.eop.gov</A>; and (ii) Jeffrey Heslop, Director/CIO, Securities 
and Exchange Commission, C/O Remi Pavlik-Simon, 6432 General Green Way, 
Alexandria, VA 22312; or send an e-mail to: <A HREF="mailto:PRA_Mailbox@sec.gov">PRA_Mailbox@sec.gov</A>. 
Comments must be submitted to OMB within 30 days of this notice.

    Dated: September 27, 2010.
Florence E. Harmon,
Deputy Secretary.
