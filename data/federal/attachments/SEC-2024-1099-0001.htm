Self-Regulatory Organizations; Cboe EDGX Exchange, Inc.; Notice 
of Filing and Immediate Effectiveness of a Proposed Rule Change To 
Amend its Fees Schedule

August 8, 2024.
    Pursuant to Section 19(b)(1) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 
(``Act''),\1\ and Rule 19b-4 thereunder,\2\ notice is hereby given that 
on August 1, 2024, Cboe EDGX Exchange, Inc. (the ``Exchange'' or 
``EDGX'') filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission (``SEC'' or 
``Commission'') the proposed rule change as described in Items I, II, 
and III below, which Items have been prepared by the Exchange. The 
Commission is publishing this notice to solicit comments on the 
proposed rule change from interested persons.

I. Self-Regulatory Organization's Statement of the Terms of Substance 
of the Proposed Rule Change

    Cboe EDGX Exchange, Inc. (the ``Exchange'' or ``EDGX'') proposes to 
amend its Fees Schedule. The text of the proposed rule change is 
provided in Exhibit 5.
    The text of the proposed rule change is also available on the 
Exchange's website (<a href="http://markets.cboe.com/us/options/regulation/rule_filings/edgx/">http://markets.cboe.com/us/options/regulation/rule_filings/edgx/</a>) at the Exchange's Office of the Secretary, and at 
the Commission's Public Reference Room.

II. Self-Regulatory Organization's Statement of the Purpose of, and 
Statutory Basis for, the Proposed Rule Change

    In its filing with the Commission, the Exchange included statements 
concerning the purpose of and basis for the proposed rule change and 
discussed any comments it received on the proposed rule change. The 
text of these statements may be examined at the places specified in 
Item IV below. The Exchange has prepared summaries, set forth in 
sections A, B, and C below, of the most significant aspects of such 
statements.

A. Self-Regulatory Organization's Statement of the Purpose of, and 
Statutory Basis for, the Proposed Rule Change

1. Purpose
    The Exchange proposes to amend its Fees Schedule, effective August 
1, 2024.
    The Exchange first notes that it operates in a highly competitive 
market in which market participants can readily direct order flow to 
competing venues if they deem fee levels at a particular venue to be 
excessive or incentives to be insufficient. More specifically, the 
Exchange is only one of 17 options venues to which market participants 
may direct their order flow. Based on publicly available information, 
no single options exchange has more than 12% of the market share.\3\ 
Thus, in such a low-concentrated and highly competitive market, no 
single options exchange possesses significant pricing power in the 
execution of option order flow. The Exchange believes that the ever-
shifting market share among the exchanges from month to month 
demonstrates that market participants can shift order flow or 
discontinue to reduce use of certain categories of products in response 
to fee changes. Accordingly, competitive forces constrain the 
Exchange's transaction fees, and market participants can readily trade 
on competing venues if they deem pricing levels at those other venues 
to be more favorable.
---------------------------------------------------------------------------

    \3\ See Cboe Global Markets U.S. Options Monthly Market Volume 
Summary (July 30, 2024), available at <a href="https://markets.cboe.com/us/options/market_statistics/">https://markets.cboe.com/us/options/market_statistics/</a>.
---------------------------------------------------------------------------

    The Exchange assesses fees in connection with orders routed away to 
various exchanges. The Exchange notes that its current approach to 
routing fees is to set forth in a simple manner certain sub-categories 
of fees that approximate the cost of routing to other options exchanges 
based on the cost of transaction fees assessed by each venue as well as 
a flat $0.15 assessment that covers costs to the Exchange for routing 
(i.e., clearing fees, connectivity and other infrastructure costs, 
membership fees, etc.) (collectively, ``Routing Costs''). The Exchange 
then monitors the fees charged as compared to the costs of its routing 
services and adjusts its routing fees and/or sub-categories to ensure 
that the Exchange's fees do indeed result in a rough approximation of 
overall Routing Costs, and are not significantly higher or lower in any 
area. The Exchange notes that another options exchange currently 
assesses routing fees in a similar manner as the

[[Page 66160]]

Exchange's current approach to assessing approximate routing fees.
    Currently, under the Fee Codes and Associated Fees section of the 
Fees Schedule, fee code RP is appended to routed Customer orders to 
NYSE American (``AMEX''), BOX Options Exchange (``BOX''), Cboe 
Exchange, Inc. (``Cboe''), MIAX Options Exchange (``MIAX'') or Nasdaq 
PHLX LLC (``PHLX'') (excluding orders in SPY options to PHLX) and 
assesses a charge of $0.25 per contract. The Exchange proposes to amend 
fee code RP to add applicable Customer orders routed to MIAX Sapphire, 
LLC (``SPHR''), in anticipation of the launch of the new options 
exchange. The charge assessed per contract for fee code RP remains the 
same under the proposed rule change.
    The proposed changes result in an assessment of fees that, in 
anticipation of the launch of another options exchange, is in line with 
the Exchange's current approach to routing fees, that is, in a manner 
that approximates the cost of routing Customer orders to other away 
options exchanges, based on the general cost of transaction fees 
assessed by the sub-category of away options exchanges for such orders 
(as well as the Exchange's Routing Costs). The Exchange notes that 
routing through the Exchange is optional and that Members will continue 
to be able to choose where to route applicable Customer orders.
2. Statutory Basis
    The Exchange believes the proposed rule change is consistent with 
the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 (the ``Act'') and the rules and 
regulations thereunder applicable to the Exchange and, in particular, 
the requirements of Section 6(b) of the Act.\4\ Specifically, the 
Exchange believes the proposed rule change is consistent with the 
Section 6(b)(5) \5\ requirements that the rules of an exchange be 
designed to prevent fraudulent and manipulative acts and practices, to 
promote just and equitable principles of trade, to foster cooperation 
and coordination with persons engaged in regulating, clearing, 
settling, processing information with respect to, and facilitating 
transactions in securities, to remove impediments to and perfect the 
mechanism of a free and open market and a national market system, and, 
in general, to protect investors and the public interest. Additionally, 
the Exchange believes the proposed rule change is consistent with the 
Section 6(b)(5) \6\ requirement that the rules of an exchange not be 
designed to permit unfair discrimination between customers, issuers, 
brokers, or dealers. The Exchange also believes the proposed rule 
change is consistent with Section 6(b)(4) of the Act,\7\ which requires 
that Exchange rules provide for the equitable allocation of reasonable 
dues, fees, and other charges among its Members and other persons using 
its facilities.

---------------------------------------------------------------------------

    The Exchange believes the proposed rule change to amend fee code RP 
to account for SPHR's expected assessment of fees for Customer orders 
is reasonable because it is reasonably designed to assess routing fees 
in line with the Exchange's current approach to routing fees. That is, 
the proposed rule change is intended to include Customer orders routed 
to SPHR in the most appropriate sub-category of fees that approximates 
the cost of routing to a group of away options exchanges based on the 
cost of transaction fees assessed by each venue as well as Routing 
Costs to the Exchange. As noted above, the Exchange operates in a 
highly competitive market in which market participants can readily 
direct order flow to competing venues if they deem fee levels at a 
particular venue to be excessive or incentives to be insufficient. The 
Exchange notes that routing through the Exchange is optional and that 
Members will continue to be able to choose where to route their 
Customer orders in the same sub-category group of away exchanges as 
they currently may choose to route. The proposed rule change reflects a 
competitive pricing structure designed to incentivize market 
participants to direct their order flow to the Exchange, which the 
Exchange believes would enhance market quality to the benefit of all 
Members. The Exchange further notes that another options exchange 
currently approximates routing fees in a similar manner as the 
Exchange's current approach.\8\ The Exchange believes that the proposed 
rule change is equitable and not unfairly discriminatory because all 
Members' applicable Customer orders routed to SPHR will be 
automatically and uniformly assessed the applicable routing charge.
---------------------------------------------------------------------------

    \8\ See e.g., MIAX Options Exchange Fee Schedule, Section 1(c), 
``Fees for Customer Orders Routed to Another Options Exchange.''
---------------------------------------------------------------------------

B. Self-Regulatory Organization's Statement on Burden on Competition

    The Exchange does not believe that the proposed rule change will 
impose any burden on competition that is not necessary or appropriate 
in furtherance of the purposes of the Act. Particularly, the Exchange 
does not believe the proposed rule change to amend fee code RP will 
impose any burden on intramarket competition that is not necessary or 
appropriate in furtherance of the purposes of the Act. All Members' 
applicable Customer orders routed to SPHR will automatically yield fee 
code RP and uniformly be assessed the corresponding fee. The Exchange 
notes that another options exchange approximates routing costs in a 
similar manner as the Exchange's current approach.\9\
---------------------------------------------------------------------------

    \9\ See e.g., MIAX Options Exchange Fee Schedule, Section 1(c), 
``Fees for Customer Orders Routed to Another Options Exchange.''
---------------------------------------------------------------------------

    The Exchange also does not believe that the proposed rule changes 
will impose any burden on intermarket competition that is not necessary 
or appropriate in furtherance of the purposes of the Act. As previously 
discussed, the Exchange operates in a highly competitive market. 
Members have numerous alternative venues that they may participate on 
and direct their order flow, including 16 other options exchanges and 
off-exchange venues. Additionally, the Exchange represents a small 
percentage of the overall market. Based on publicly available 
information, no single options exchange has more than 16% of the market 
share.\10\ Therefore, no exchange possesses significant pricing power 
in the execution of option order flow. Indeed, participants can readily 
choose to send their orders to other exchange and off-exchange venues 
if they deem fee levels at those other venues to be more favorable. 
Moreover, the Commission has repeatedly expressed its preference for 
competition over regulatory intervention in determining prices, 
products, and services in the securities markets. Specifically, in 
Regulation NMS, the Commission highlighted the importance of market 
forces in determining prices and SRO revenues and, also, recognized 
that current regulation of the market system ``has been remarkably 
successful in promoting market competition in its broader forms that 
are most important to investors and listed companies.'' \11\ The fact 
that this market is competitive has also long been recognized by the 
courts. In NetCoalition v. Securities and Exchange Commission, the D.C. 
Circuit stated as follows: ``[n]o one disputes that competition for 
order flow is `fierce.' . . . As the SEC explained, `[i]n the U.S. 
national market system, buyers and sellers of securities, and the 
broker-

[[Page 66161]]

dealers that act as their order-routing agents, have a wide range of 
choices of where to route orders for execution'; [and] `no exchange can 
afford to take its market share percentages for granted' because `no 
exchange possesses a monopoly, regulatory or otherwise, in the 
execution of order flow from broker dealers'. . . .''.\12\ Accordingly, 
the Exchange does not believe its proposed fee change imposes any 
burden on competition that is not necessary or appropriate in 
furtherance of the purposes of the Act.

C. Self-Regulatory Organization's Statement on Comments on the Proposed 
Rule Change Received From Members, Participants, or Others

    The Exchange neither solicited nor received comments on the 
proposed rule change.

III. Date of Effectiveness of the Proposed Rule Change and Timing for 
Commission Action
