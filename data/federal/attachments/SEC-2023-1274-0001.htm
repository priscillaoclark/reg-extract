SECURITIES AND EXCHANGE COMMISSION

[Release No. 34-98850; File No. SR-FINRA-2023-014]


Self-Regulatory Organizations; Financial Industry Regulatory 
Authority, Inc.; Notice of Filing and Immediate Effectiveness of a 
Proposed Rule Change To Establish a Short-Form Membership Application 
Process and Partial Fee Waiver for Certain Firms Applying Due to 
Amended Exchange Act Rule 15b9-1

November 3, 2023.
    Pursuant to Section 19(b)(1) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 
(``Exchange Act''),\1\ and Rule 19b-4 thereunder,\2\ notice is hereby 
given that on October 30, 2023, the Financial Industry Regulatory 
Authority, Inc. (``FINRA'') filed with the Securities and Exchange 
Commission (``SEC'' or ``Commission'') the proposed rule change as 
described in Items I and II below, which Items have been prepared by 
FINRA. FINRA has designated the proposed rule change as constituting a 
``non-controversial'' rule change under paragraph (f)(6) of Rule 19b-4 
under the Act,\3\ which renders the proposal effective upon receipt of 
this filing by the Commission. The Commission is publishing this notice 
to solicit comments on the proposed rule change from interested 
persons.

I. Self-Regulatory Organization's Statement of the Terms of Substance 
of the Proposed Rule Change

    FINRA is proposing to adopt (1) FINRA Interpretive Material 1013-3 
(``IM-1013-3'') that would set forth a short-form membership 
application process for firms that apply for FINRA membership due to 
the amendments to Exchange Act Rule 15b9-1,\4\ adopted by the 
Commission on August 23, 2023; \5\ and (2) FINRA Interpretive Material 
Section 4(e) of Schedule A to the FINRA By-Laws (``IM-Section 4(e)'') 
that would provide a partial waiver of the new membership application 
fee to those firms that are eligible to apply for FINRA membership 
pursuant to proposed IM-1013-3. Proposed IM-1013-3 and IM-Section 4(e) 
would be available only to SEC-registered non-FINRA member firms that 
apply for FINRA membership due to the Commission's Exchange Act Rule 
15b9-1 amendments and, as of August 23, 2023, have been a member of a 
national securities exchange with which FINRA has had a regulatory 
service agreement (``RSA'') for the 12-month period prior to August 23, 
2023 (``Eligible Firms'').

II. Self-Regulatory Organization's Statement of the Purpose of, and 
Statutory Basis for, the Proposed Rule Change

    In its filing with the Commission, FINRA included statements 
concerning the purpose of and basis for the proposed rule change and 
discussed any comments it received on the proposed rule change. The 
text of these statements may be examined at the places specified in 
Item IV below. FINRA has prepared summaries, set forth in sections A, 
B, and C below, of the most significant aspects of such statements.

[[Page 77385]]

A. Self-Regulatory Organization's Statement of the Purpose of, and 
Statutory Basis for, the Proposed Rule Change

1. Purpose
    On August 23, 2023, the Commission adopted amendments to Exchange 
Act Rule 15b9-1 that narrowed the exemption from membership in a 
registered national securities association (``Association'') for 
certain SEC-registered brokers or dealers that effect securities 
transactions other than on a national securities exchange of which they 
are a member.\6\ Under amended Exchange Act Rule 15b9-1, a broker or 
dealer that effects securities transactions other than on a national 
securities exchange of which it is a member is exempt from Association 
membership if such broker or dealer (1) is a member of a national 
securities exchange; (2) carries no customer accounts; and (3) such 
transactions result solely from orders that are routed by a national 
securities exchange of which it is a member to comply with order 
protection regulatory requirements, or are solely for the purpose of 
executing the stock leg of a stock-option order.\7\ Due to the 
amendments, certain existing SEC-registered brokers or dealers will no 
longer qualify for the exemption from Association membership and must 
become FINRA members.\8\ The Commission has announced an effective date 
of November 6, 2023, and a compliance date of September 6, 2024.
---------------------------------------------------------------------------

    \6\ See supra note 5.
    \7\ 17 CFR 240.15b9-1.
    \8\ FINRA is currently the only registered national securities 
association.
---------------------------------------------------------------------------

Application Review Process for New FINRA Membership Under FINRA Rule 
1013 (New Member Application and Interview) and Application Filing Fee
    An entity seeking to become a new FINRA member firm must undergo an 
application process that typically begins by filing Form NMA 
(Application for New Membership) with FINRA in accordance with Rule 
1013.\9\ FINRA Rule 1014 (Department Decision) provides that after 
considering the application, a membership interview, other information 
and documents provided by the applicant or obtained by FINRA, and the 
public interest and protection of investors, FINRA must determine 
whether the applicant meets the standards for admission.\10\ Under Rule 
1014, FINRA must render a decision on a new membership application 
within 180 days after the application is filed (or such later date as 
FINRA and the applicant have agreed in writing).\11\ When the applicant 
submits Form NMA, it must also submit the appropriate filing fee 
pursuant to Section 4(e) of Schedule A to the FINRA By-Laws. As 
described below, FINRA is proposing to establish a short-form 
membership application process for Eligible Firms and provide for a 
partial waiver of the new membership application fee.
---------------------------------------------------------------------------

    \9\ A firm seeking new FINRA membership must also, among other 
requirements, provide FINRA with the documents and information 
outlined in Rule 1013(a)(1)(B) through (R).
    \10\ See generally Rule 1014(a).
    \11\ Pursuant to FINRA Rule 1015 (Review by National 
Adjudicatory Council), an applicant may file a written request for 
review of FINRA's decision with the National Adjudicatory Council.
---------------------------------------------------------------------------

Short-Form Membership Application Process
    In lieu of completing Form NMA and the other requirements under 
Rule 1013, including the new membership interview, proposed IM-1013-3 
would allow an Eligible Firm to undergo a new membership application 
process that would permit completing a short-form application. An 
Eligible Firm would otherwise remain subject to all applicable FINRA 
rules, including the provisions of the FINRA Rule 1000 Series 
(Membership Application and Associated Person Registration).\12\
---------------------------------------------------------------------------

    \12\ While FINRA typically has 180 days after a firm submits a 
new membership application to issue a decision, absent any factors 
that might prompt a request for additional information or for a full 
membership application, FINRA anticipates that it can process most 
applications for Eligible Firms and issue a decision in line with, 
or in many cases more quickly than, FINRA's current Fast-Track 
Review process timeframe for eligible applications. Under the Fast-
Track Review process, FINRA aims to process eligible full membership 
applications within 100 days. See infra note 14.
---------------------------------------------------------------------------

    FINRA recognizes that Eligible Firms have already undergone a 
membership application and review process with at least one national 
securities exchange to determine whether these firms were fit for 
membership. In addition, FINRA currently has substantial information 
about and experience with these firms and therefore is familiar with 
their businesses and associated risks (e.g., operational risks, market 
risk, market integrity risk) by virtue of the regulatory services FINRA 
provides pursuant to the RSAs it has with the national securities 
exchanges of which Eligible Firms are members.\13\ For example, FINRA 
already conducts exams of Eligible Firms pursuant to an RSA, including 
trading-related exams for most of these firms. FINRA also provides, 
among other regulatory services, cross-market surveillance, 
investigations and disciplinary services pursuant to those RSAs. Some 
of the Eligible Firms are also affiliates of member firms. For these 
reasons, FINRA believes an abbreviated, short-form membership 
application process is appropriate for the Eligible Firms and that, in 
most cases, FINRA can effectively determine whether an Eligible Firm 
meets the membership standards in Rule 1014 without requiring 
submission of a Form NMA, provision of additional information or 
engaging in a formal interview with the firm.
---------------------------------------------------------------------------

    \13\ FINRA already has access to most, if not all, documents and 
information that would be required of these Eligible Firms during 
the membership application process. For example, by virtue of the 
regulatory services FINRA provides pursuant to the RSAs and related 
Central Registration Depository (``Web CRD[supreg]'') agreements it 
has with the national securities exchanges of which Eligible Firms 
are members, FINRA has access to, among other documents and 
information, Forms BD, Forms U4 for all registered persons and 
principals and other information available on Web CRD[supreg], as 
well as Risk Assessment Reports, financial filings such as FOCUS 
Reports and Annual Reports and most recent Examination Reports with 
accompanying files and dispositions.
---------------------------------------------------------------------------

    Nonetheless, depending on particular facts and circumstances, FINRA 
may find it necessary to obtain additional information to evaluate an 
Eligible Firm for membership. To that end, proposed IM-1013-3 would 
provide that FINRA, in the public interest and for the protection of 
investors, may require an Eligible Firm to provide FINRA with 
additional information or documents or meet any other requirement 
pursuant to Rule 1013, or to apply for membership pursuant to the full 
application and interview process under Rule 1013.\14\ In addition, 
proposed IM-1013-3 would provide that if an Eligible Firm's application 
for FINRA membership seeks to materially expand or change the firm's 
business operations, such firm would be required to apply for new FINRA 
membership pursuant to the full application and interview process under 
Rule 1013, including completing Form NMA and submitting the appropriate 
application fee set forth in Section 4(e) of Schedule A to the FINRA 
By-Laws.\15\
---------------------------------------------------------------------------

    \14\ Factors that might prompt a request for additional 
information or a full membership application could include, for 
example, whether an Eligible Firm's associated person is subject to 
a statutory disqualification or there are regulatory gaps identified 
that such firm would need to address to come into compliance with 
FINRA rules.
    \15\ If a firm is approved for FINRA membership and subsequently 
contemplates a business expansion to include activities beyond the 
scope underlying the new membership approval or a material change in 
business operations as that term is defined in paragraph (m) under 
FINRA Rule 1011 (Definitions), then such firm must apply for 
approval for a change in business operations pursuant to FINRA Rule 
1017 (Application for Approval of Change in Ownership, Control, or 
Business Operations) and would be subject to the appropriate fee 
pursuant to Schedule A to the FINRA By-Laws.
---------------------------------------------------------------------------

    Proposed IM-1013-3 would also require an Eligible Firm to submit 
the

[[Page 77386]]

short-form application to FINRA at least 120 calendar days before the 
amended Exchange Act Rule 15b9-1 compliance date to provide FINRA with 
the time to process a firm's short-form membership application before 
the amended Exchange Act Rule 15b9-1 compliance date--unless FINRA, in 
its discretion, agrees to accept an application after this deadline but 
before the amended Exchange Act Rule 15b9-1 compliance date.\16\ As 
stated above, the Commission has announced a compliance date of 
September 6, 2024.
---------------------------------------------------------------------------

    \16\ As stated above, certain factors may prompt a request for 
additional information or for a full membership application, which 
could prolong the time needed for FINRA to process a firm's 
application and issue a decision. Therefore, FINRA would encourage 
firms to apply for membership pursuant to proposed IM-1013-3 even 
earlier than 120 days before the compliance date of amended Exchange 
Act Rule 15b9-1.
---------------------------------------------------------------------------

Partial Membership Application Fee Waiver
    As stated above, the fee for an application for new membership, 
submitted through Form NMA, is typically subject to the fee structure 
set forth under Section 4(e) of Schedule A to the FINRA By-Laws.\17\ 
FINRA is proposing a partial waiver of the new membership application 
fee for a short-form application submitted pursuant to proposed IM-
1013-3. Proposed IM-Section 4(e) would assess one-half the applicable 
membership application fee set forth in Section 4(e) of Schedule A to 
the FINRA By-Laws. FINRA believes a partial fee waiver is appropriate 
with respect to the review of a short-form application submitted by an 
Eligible Firm because, as stated above, FINRA has substantial 
information about and experience with these firms and is familiar with 
their business and associated risks by virtue of the regulatory 
services FINRA provides pursuant to RSAs with the national securities 
exchanges of which the Eligible Firms are members. As such, FINRA will 
not need to obtain the same amount of information from an Eligible Firm 
that applies with the short-form application or dedicate the same 
resources to evaluate such an application as it would in other cases. 
However, as stated above, if FINRA determines that an Eligible Firm 
must undergo the full application and interview process pursuant to 
Rule 1013, such firm shall be assessed the full membership application 
fee set forth in Section 4(e) of Schedule A to the FINRA By-Laws.\18\
---------------------------------------------------------------------------

    \17\ Pursuant to Section 4(e) of Schedule A to the FINRA By-
Laws, the fees associated with a new FINRA membership application 
can vary, including a one-time application fee ranging from $7,500 
to $55,000, depending on the number of registered representatives 
associated with a firm.
    \18\ See FINRA By-Laws, Schedule A, Section 4(e).
---------------------------------------------------------------------------

    FINRA has filed the proposed rule change for immediate 
effectiveness. FINRA will announce the implementation date of the 
proposed rule change in a Regulatory Notice.
2. Statutory Basis
    FINRA believes that the proposed rule change is consistent with the 
provisions of Section 15A(b)(6) of the Act,\19\ which requires, among 
other things, that FINRA rules must be designed to prevent fraudulent 
and manipulative acts and practices, to promote just and equitable 
principles of trade, and, in general, to protect investors and the 
public interest, and must not be designed to permit unfair 
discrimination between customers, issuers, brokers, or dealers. FINRA 
believes the proposed rule change would facilitate efficient and 
expedited processing of membership applications from the Eligible 
Firms, while maintaining investor protection by ensuring that these 
firms meet the applicable standards for FINRA membership. As stated 
above, the Eligible Firms have already undergone a membership 
application and review process with at least one national securities 
exchange to determine whether these firms were fit for membership. In 
addition, FINRA has substantial information about and experience with 
these firms and therefore is familiar with their businesses and 
associated risks (e.g., operational risks, market risk, market 
integrity risk) by virtue of the regulatory services FINRA provides 
pursuant to the RSAs it has with the national securities exchanges of 
which Eligible Firms are members. FINRA also retains the ability to 
request additional documents or information from an Eligible Firm or to 
require a firm to undergo the full application and interview process 
pursuant to Rule 1013, which further protects investors and the public 
interest.
---------------------------------------------------------------------------

    \19\ 15 U.S.C. 78o-3(b)(6).
---------------------------------------------------------------------------

    FINRA believes that the proposed rule change is consistent with the 
provisions of Section 15A(b)(5) of the Act,\20\ which requires, among 
other things, that FINRA rules provide for the equitable allocation of 
reasonable dues, fees and other charges among members and issuers and 
other persons using any facility or system that FINRA operates or 
controls. FINRA believes that the proposed partial waiver of the 
membership application fee, which would be available to all Eligible 
Firms that qualify to apply for new FINRA membership pursuant to 
proposed IM-1013-3, is consistent with an equitable allocation of 
reasonable fees. FINRA believes the proposed partial fee waiver 
reflects an equitable allocation of reasonable fees considering the 
streamlined review process contemplated in the short-form membership 
application process. As discussed above, to facilitate this streamlined 
membership application process, FINRA is able to leverage the 
substantial information about and experience with these firms gained by 
virtue of the regulatory services FINRA provides pursuant to RSAs with 
the national securities exchanges of which these firms are members. As 
such, FINRA would not need to obtain the same amount of information 
from an Eligible Firm applicant that it would from a non-Eligible Firm 
applicant. Moreover, the review process would also be streamlined for 
an Eligible Firm applicant relative to a non-Eligible Firm applicant. 
Thus, it is equitable to apply the fee waiver only to the Eligible 
Firms.
---------------------------------------------------------------------------

    \20\ 15 U.S.C. 78o-3(b)(5).
---------------------------------------------------------------------------

B. Self-Regulatory Organization's Statement on Burden on Competition

    FINRA does not believe that the proposed rule change will result in 
any burden on competition that is not necessary or appropriate in 
furtherance of the purposes of the Act.
Economic Impact Assessment
(a) Regulatory Need
    As discussed above, as a result of amendments to Exchange Act Rule 
15b9-1, certain SEC-registered brokers or dealers that effect 
securities transactions other than on a national securities exchange of 
which they are a member will no longer qualify for an exemption from 
Association membership. FINRA understands that as a result, 
approximately 62 firms may seek to become FINRA members by the 
compliance date of amended Exchange Act Rule 15b9-1.\21\ FINRA further 
understands that most, if not all, of these firms meet the standards 
for

[[Page 77387]]

Eligible Firms as defined above. FINRA can, in most cases, effectively 
determine whether an Eligible Firm meets the membership standards in 
Rule 1014 without requiring submission of a Form NMA or subjecting such 
a firm to the other application and interview requirements of Rule 
1013.\22\
---------------------------------------------------------------------------

    \21\ The Commission estimated that, as of April 2023, there were 
64 firms that were SEC-registered broker-dealers and exchange 
members but not FINRA members, and that such firms have forgone 
FINRA membership presumably in reliance on Exchange Act Rule 15b9-1. 
See Securities Exchange Act Release No. 98202 (August 23, 2023), 88 
FR 61850, 61853-54 (September 7, 2023) (Exemption for Certain 
Exchange Members; Final Rule). The actual number of firms that may 
ultimately seek FINRA membership due to the narrowed exemption may 
change based on several factors. For example, since the Commission's 
estimate in April 2023, some firms have terminated their status as 
an SEC-registered broker-dealer or have already become FINRA 
members.
    \22\ The full membership application process may be required in 
some cases. See supra note 14.
---------------------------------------------------------------------------

    The proposed rule change to implement the short-form membership 
application process would allow FINRA to review membership applications 
from Eligible Firms efficiently while maintaining investor protection. 
The partial membership application fee waiver is aligned with the 
proposed short-form membership application process and the related 
streamlined review process.
(b) Economic Baseline
    The economic baseline for the proposed rule change includes the 
full application and interview process provided in Rule 1013, the 
membership application fee set forth in Section 4(e) of Schedule A to 
the FINRA By-Laws, and the recent amendments to Exchange Act Rule 15b9-
1. FINRA understands that approximately 62 firms may seek to become 
FINRA members by the compliance date for amended Exchange Act Rule 
15b9-1.
(c) Economic Impacts
i. Anticipated Benefits
    Eligible Firms that successfully become FINRA members through the 
short-form membership application process would benefit from financial 
and non-financial cost savings given that these firms would not be 
required to provide documents and other information that are required 
under the full application and interview process. Eligible Firms would 
also receive a financial benefit from paying only one-half of the 
membership application fee. Becoming FINRA members more quickly would 
also resolve earlier any uncertainty firms may have about being able to 
join FINRA by the Commission's compliance date for its amendments to 
Exchange Act Rule 15b9-1.
ii. Anticipated Costs
    Relative to the baseline, FINRA anticipates little or no additional 
risks to market integrity or investors. FINRA will obtain additional 
information or documents or require a firm to go through the regular 
NMA process if such is in the public interest and for the protection of 
investors. A firm that seeks to materially expand or change its 
business operations when applying would be required to apply for FINRA 
membership pursuant to all requirements under Rule 1013. A firm that is 
approved for FINRA membership and subsequently contemplates a business 
expansion to include activities beyond the scope underlying the new 
membership approval or a material change in business operations would 
be required to apply for approval for a change in business operations 
pursuant to Rule 1017 and be subject to the appropriate fee pursuant to 
Schedule A to the FINRA By-Laws.
iii. Anticipated Competitive Effects
    Relative to the baseline in which Eligible Firms would go through 
the full application and interview process and pay the full membership 
application fee, FINRA anticipates minimal competitive effects, if any. 
A streamlined membership application process for Eligible Firms would 
provide them certainty that they will be able to continue their 
business in compliance with amended Exchange Act Rule 15b9-1. Such 
certainty would mitigate any concerns regarding their ability to 
compete in the security markets without interruption.
    In addition, Eligible Firms that successfully become FINRA members 
through the short-form membership application process would retain the 
resources that they would have otherwise spent on the full application 
and interview process and would pay only one-half of the membership 
application fee. These firms may use these resources for operational or 
investment purposes. Regarding the membership application fee, however, 
FINRA anticipates that the median amount waived would be $6,250.\23\ 
FINRA does not believe that this amount would significantly impact an 
Eligible Firm's business. Similarly, with respect to firms that seek 
FINRA membership but do not meet the proposed definition of ``Eligible 
Firm'' and therefore are not able to avail themselves of the short-form 
membership application and partial fee waiver, FINRA does not 
anticipate that the existence of the proposal would deter such firms 
from applying for FINRA membership or place them at a significant 
disadvantage relative to Eligible Firms. Thus, FINRA expects that the 
effect of the proposed rule change on industry structure and 
competition would be insignificant.
---------------------------------------------------------------------------

    \23\ The average amount waived is anticipated to be $6,840 and 
ranges from $3,750 to $15,000.
---------------------------------------------------------------------------

(d) Alternatives Considered
    FINRA considered charging the full membership application fee for 
Eligible Firms. However, FINRA believes a partial membership 
application fee waiver is appropriate because, as stated above, FINRA 
would not need to obtain the same amount of information from an 
Eligible Firm applicant or dedicate the same resources to evaluate such 
applicant as it would for a typical new applicant because FINRA is able 
to leverage the substantial information about and experience with these 
firms gained by virtue of the regulatory services FINRA provides 
pursuant to the RSAs with the national securities exchanges of which 
the Eligible Firms are members.

C. Self-Regulatory Organization's Statement on Comments on the Proposed 
Rule Change Received From Members, Participants, or Others

    Written comments were neither solicited nor received.

III. Date of Effectiveness of the Proposed Rule Change and Timing for 
Commission Action

    Because the foregoing proposed rule change does not: (i) 
significantly affect the protection of investors or the public 
interest; (ii) impose any significant burden on competition; and (iii) 
become operative for 30 days after the date of the filing, or such 
shorter time as the Commission may designate if consistent with the 
protection of investors and the public interest, it has become 
effective pursuant to Section 19(b)(3)(A) of the Act \24\ and Rule 19b-
4(f)(6) \25\ thereunder.
---------------------------------------------------------------------------

    \24\ 15 U.S.C. 78s(b)(3)(A).
    \25\ 17 CFR 240.19b-4(f)(6). In addition, Rule 19b-4(f)(6) 
requires a self-regulatory organization to give the Commission 
written notice of its intent to file the proposed rule change, along 
with a brief description and text of the proposed rule change, at 
least five business days prior to the date of filing of the proposed 
rule change, or such shorter time as designated by the Commission. 
FINRA has satisfied this requirement.
---------------------------------------------------------------------------

    A proposed rule change filed under Rule 19b-4(f)(6) \26\ normally 
does not become operative prior to 30 days after the date of the 
filing. However, pursuant to Rule 19b-4(f)(6)(iii),\27\ the Commission 
may designate a shorter time if such action is consistent with the 
protection of investors and the public interest. FINRA has asked the 
Commission to waive the 30-day operative delay so that the proposed 
rule change may become operative upon filing. FINRA proposes to make 
the proposed rule change operative on the

[[Page 77388]]

date of filing to allow Eligible Firms to apply for FINRA membership 
pursuant to proposed IM-1013-3 beginning on, or as close as possible 
to, the November 6, 2023 effective date of amended Exchange Act Rule 
15b9-1. FINRA stated that while under the proposed rule change Eligible 
Firms must apply for membership at least 120 days before the September 
6, 2024 compliance date of amended Exchange Act Rule 15b9-1, some firms 
have already inquired about beginning the application process. For 
those firms that wish to apply close to the effective date, this will 
also provide FINRA with additional time to process such Eligible Firms' 
applications and provide more certainty that they will be able to 
continue their business in compliance with amended Exchange Act Rule 
15b9-1. For these reasons, the Commission believes that waiving the 30-
day operative delay is consistent with the protection of investors and 
the public interest. Therefore, the Commission hereby waives the 
operative delay and designates the proposal operative upon filing.\28\
---------------------------------------------------------------------------

    \26\ 17 CFR 240.19b-4(f)(6).
    \27\ 17 CFR 240.19b-4(f)(6)(iii).
    \28\ For purposes only of waiving the 30-day operative delay, 
the Commission has considered the proposed rule's impact on 
efficiency, competition, and capital formation. See 15 U.S.C. 
78c(f).
---------------------------------------------------------------------------

    At any time within 60 days of the filing of the proposed rule 
change, the Commission summarily may temporarily suspend such rule 
change if it appears to the Commission that such action is necessary or 
appropriate in the public interest, for the protection of investors, or 
otherwise in furtherance of the purposes of the Act. If the Commission 
takes such action, the Commission shall institute proceedings to 
determine whether the proposed rule should be approved or disapproved.
