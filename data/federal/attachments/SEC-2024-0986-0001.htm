the Commission designated a longer period within which to approve the 
proposed rule change, disapprove the proposed rule change, or institute

under Section 19(b)(2)(B) of the Act \6\ to determine whether to 
approve or disapprove the proposed rule change.\7\

Commission shall issue an order approving or disapproving the proposed

notice of filing of the proposed rule change. The Commission may extend 
the period for issuing an order approving or disapproving the proposed

determines that a longer period is appropriate and publishes the 
reasons for such determination. The proposed rule change was published 
for comment in the Federal Register on January 25, 2024.\9\ The 180th 
day after publication of the notice for this proposed rule change is

    The Commission finds that it is appropriate to designate a longer 
period within which to issue an order approving or disapproving the 
proposed rule change so that it has sufficient time to consider the 
proposed rule change and the issues raised therein. Accordingly, the 
Commission, pursuant to Section 19(b)(2) of the Act,\10\ designates 
September 20, 2024, as the date by which the Commission shall either 
approve or disapprove the proposed rule change (File No. SR-FINRA-2024-
004).
