SECURITIES AND EXCHANGE COMMISSION

 
Submission for OMB Review; Comment Request

Upon Written Request, Copies Available From: Securities and Exchange 
Commission, Office of Investor Education and Advocacy, Washington, DC 
20549-0213.

Extension:
    Rule 17a-1; SEC File No. 270-244; OMB Control No. 3235-0208.

    Notice is hereby given that, pursuant to the Paperwork Reduction 
Act of 1995 (44 U.S.C. 3501 et seq.), the Securities and Exchange 
Commission (``Commission'') has submitted to the Office of Management 
and Budget a request for approval of extension of the previously 
approved collection of information provided for in Rule 17a-1 (17 CFR 
240.17a-1) under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended (the 
``Act'') (15 U.S.C. 78a et seq.).
    Rule 17a-1 requires that every national securities exchange, 
national securities association, registered clearing agency, and the 
Municipal Securities Rulemaking Board keep on file for a period of not 
less than five years, the first two years in an easily accessible 
place, at least one copy of all documents, including all 
correspondence, memoranda, papers, books, notices, accounts, and other 
such records made or received by it in the course of its business as 
such and in the conduct of its self-regulatory activity, and that such 
documents be available for examination by the Commission.
    There are 22 entities required to comply with the rule: 14 national 
securities exchanges, 1 national securities association, 6 registered 
clearing agencies, and the Municipal Securities Rulemaking Board. The 
Commission staff estimates that the average number of hours necessary 
for compliance with the requirements of Rule 17a-1 is 50 hours per 
year. In addition, 4 national securities exchanges notice-registered 
pursuant to Section 6(g) of the Act (15 U.S.C. 78f(g)) are required to 
preserve records of determinations made under Rule 3a55-1 under the Act 
(17 CFR 240.3a55-1), which the Commission staff estimates will take 1 
hour per exchange, for a total of 4 hours. Accordingly, the Commission 
staff estimates that the total number of hours necessary to comply with 
the requirements of Rule 17a-1 is 1,104 hours. The average cost per 
hour is $59. Therefore, the total cost of compliance for the 
respondents is $65,136.
    Compliance with Rule 17a-1 is mandatory. Rule 17a-1 does not assure 
confidentiality for the records maintained pursuant to the rule. The 
records required by Rule 17a-1 are available only for examination by 
the Commission staff, state securities authorities and the self-
regulatory organizations. Subject to the provisions of the Freedom of 
Information Act, 5 U.S.C. 522, and the Commission's rules thereunder 
(17 CFR 200.80(b)(4)(iii)), the Commission does not generally publish 
or make available information contained in any reports, summaries, 
analyses, letters, or memoranda arising out of, in anticipation of, or 
in connection with an examination or inspection of the books and 
records of any person or any other investigation.
    An agency may not conduct or sponsor, and a person is not required 
to respond to, a collection of information
