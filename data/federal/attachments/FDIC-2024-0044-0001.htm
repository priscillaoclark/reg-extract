    General Description of Collection: Section 32 of the FDIA (12 
U.S.C. 1831i) requires an insured depository institution or depository 
institution holding company under certain circumstances to notify the 
appropriate federal banking agency of the proposed addition of any 
individual to the board of directors or the employment of any 
individual as a senior executive officer of such institution at least 
30 days before such addition or employment becomes effective. Section 
32 of the FDIA also provides that the FDIC may disapprove an 
individual's service as a director or senior executive officer of 
certain state nonmember banks or state savings associations if, upon 
assessing the individual's competence, experience, character, and 
integrity, it is determined that the individual's service would not be 
in the best interest of the depositors of the institution or the 
public. The Interagency Notice of Change in Director or Senior 
Executive Officer, with the information contained in the Interagency 
Biographical and Financial Report (described above) as an attachment, 
is used by the FDIC to collect information relevant to assess the 
individual's competence, experience, character, and integrity. There is 
no change in the methodology or substance of this information 
collection. The reduction in estimated annual burden (from 214 hours in 
2021 to 124 hours currently) is due to the decrease in the estimated 
number of annual responses.

associations.

    General Description of Collection: The Prompt Corrective Action 
(PCA) provisions of section 38 of the Federal Deposit Insurance Act 
requires or permits the FDIC and other federal banking agencies to take 
certain supervisory actions when FDIC-insured institutions fall within 
certain capital categories. They also restrict or prohibit certain 
activities and require the submission of a capital restoration plan 
when an insured institution becomes undercapitalized. Various 
provisions of the statute and the FDIC's implementing regulations 
require the prior approval of the FDIC before an FDIC-supervised 
institution, or certain insured depository institutions, can engage in 
certain activities, or allow the FDIC to make exceptions to 
restrictions that would otherwise be imposed. This

collection of information consists of the applications that are 
required to obtain the FDIC's prior approval to engage in these 
activities. There is no change in the methodology or substance of this 
information collection. The estimated burden remains unchanged from 
2021.

Subsidiaries of certain FDIC Supervised Institutions; Revisions to the

     (Hours).
----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

    General Description of Collection: Part 382 of the FDIC regulations 
(part 382) is necessary to give effect to such cross-default 
restrictions in the International Swaps and Derivatives Association, 
Inc. (ISDA) 2015 Universal Resolution Stay Protocol (ISDA Protocol). 
Part 382 requires that FDIC-supervised institutions that are 
subsidiaries of global systemically important banks (GSIBs) and their 
counterparties either adhere to the ISDA Protocol or take the 
prescribed steps to amend the contractual provisions of their Qualified 
Financial Contracts (QFCs), consistent with the requirements in the 
rule, within a specified period of time. If such institutions elect to 
amend their QFCs in lieu of adhering to the ISDA Protocol, they must 
seek the FDIC's approval of the proposed amendments, giving rise to 
this information collection. The information collection is necessary to 
ensure QFCs are amended in compliance with part 382. The rule applies 
to FDIC-supervised institutions that are subsidiaries of GSIBs and sets 
forth requirements parallel to those contained in similar rules 
recently published by the Federal Reserve Board and the Office of the 
Comptroller of the Currency with regard to entities they supervise to 
ensure consistent regulatory treatment of QFCs among the various 
entities within a GSIB group.
    There is no change in the methodology or substance of this 
information collection. The total estimated annual burden for this 
information collection is 10 hours, which is a decrease of 10 hours 
from the 2021 information collection submission (20 hours). This 
decrease is a result of a reduction in the estimated annual number of 
respondents because of the automation and standardization of business 
processes.

Request for Comment

    Comments are invited on: (a) Whether the collection of information 
is necessary for the proper performance of the FDIC's functions, 
including whether the information has practical utility; (b) the 
accuracy of the estimates of the burden of the information collection, 
including the validity of the methodology and assumptions used; (c) 
ways to enhance the quality, utility, and clarity of the information to 
be collected; and (d) ways to minimize the burden of the collection of 
information on respondents, including through the use of automated 
collection techniques or other forms of information technology. All 
comments will become a matter of public record.
