Form 10-D is mandatory and all information is made available to the 
public upon request. Form 10-D takes approximately 39.0 hours per 
response to prepare and is filed by approximately 8,258 respondents. We 
estimate that 75% of the 39.0 hours per response (29.25 hours) is 
prepared by the company for a total annual reporting burden of 241,547 
hours (29.25 hours per response x 8,258 responses).
    Written comments are invited on: (a) whether this proposed 
collection of information is necessary for the proper performance of 
the functions of the agency, including whether the information will 
have practical utility; (b) the accuracy of the agency's estimate of 
the burden imposed by the collection of information; (c) ways to 
enhance the quality, utility, and clarity of the information collected; 
and (d) ways to minimize the burden of the collection of information on 
respondents, including through the use of automated collection 
techniques or other forms of information technology. Consideration will 
be given to comments and suggestions submitted in writing within 60 
days of this publication by September 30, 2024.
    An agency may not conduct or sponsor, and a person is not required 
to respond to, a collection of information unless it displays a 
currently valid control number.
