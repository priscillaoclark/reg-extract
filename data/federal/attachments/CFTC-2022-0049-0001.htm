SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION: 
    Title: Regulation 16.02 Daily Trade and Supporting Data Reports 
(OMB Control No. 3038-0061). This is a request for an extension of a 
currently approved information collection.
    Abstract: Commission Rule 16.02 requires Reporting Markets to 
report transaction-level trade data and related order information for 
each executed transaction. The Commission uses the transaction-level 
trade data and related order information to discharge its regulatory 
responsibilities, including the responsibilities to prevent market 
manipulations and commodity price distortions and ensure the financial 
integrity of its jurisdictional markets.
    An agency may not conduct or sponsor, and a person is not required 
to respond to, a collection of information unless it displays a 
currently valid OMB control number. On May 23, 2022, the Commission 
published in the Federal Register notice of the proposed extension of 
this information collection and provided 60 days for public comment on 
the proposed extension, 87 FR 31217 (``60-Day Notice''). The Commission 
did not receive any relevant comments on the 60-Day Notice.
    Burden Statement: The Commission is revising its estimate of the 
burden for this collection to reflect the current number of respondents 
and estimated burden hours. The respondent burden for this collection 
is estimated to be as follows:
    Estimated Number of Respondents: 20.
    Estimated Average Burden Hours Per Respondent: 500 hours.
    Estimated Total Annual Burden Hours: 10,000 hours.
    Frequency of Collection: Daily.
    There are no capital costs or operating and maintenance costs 
associated with this collection.

(Authority: 44 U.S.C. 3501 et seq.)

    Dated: July 25, 2022.
Robert Sidman,
Deputy Secretary of the Commission.
