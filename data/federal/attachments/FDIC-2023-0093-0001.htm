MATTERS TO BE CONSIDERED: The Special Review Committee of the Federal 
Deposit Insurance Corporation met to consider matters related to the 
Corporation's corporate activities within its authority to act on 
behalf of the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation. In calling the

of Director Jonathan P. McKernan and Director Michael J. Hsu (Acting

consideration of the matters which were to be the subject of this 
meeting on less than seven days' notice to the public; that no earlier 
notice of the meeting was practicable; that the public interest did not 
require consideration of the matters in a meeting open to public 
observation; and that the matters could be considered in a closed 
meeting by authority of subsections (c)(2) and (c)(4) of the 
``Government in the Sunshine Act'' (5 U.S.C. 552b(c)(2) and (c)(4)).
