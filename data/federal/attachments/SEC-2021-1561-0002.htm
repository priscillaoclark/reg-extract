SECURITIES AND EXCHANGE COMMISSION

[SEC File No. 270-269, OMB Control No. 3235-0276]


Proposed Collection; Comment Request; Extension: Rule 6c-7

Upon Written Request, Copies Available From: Securities and Exchange 
Commission, Office of FOIA Services, 100 F Street NE, Washington, DC 
20549-2736

    Notice is hereby given that, pursuant to the Paperwork Reduction 
Act of 1995 (44 U.S.C. 3501 et seq.), the Securities and Exchange 
Commission (the ``Commission'') is soliciting comments on the 
collection of information summarized below. The Commission plans to 
submit this existing collection of information to the Office of 
Management and Budget for extension and approval.
    Rule 6c-7 (17 CFR 270.6c-7) under the Investment Company Act of 
1940 (15 U.S.C. 80a-1 et seq.) (``1940 Act'') provides exemption from 
certain provisions of Sections 22(e) and 27 of the 1940 Act for 
registered separate accounts offering variable annuity contracts to 
certain employees of Texas institutions of higher education 
participating in the Texas Optional Retirement Program. There are 
approximately 129 registrants governed by Rule 6c-7. The burden of 
compliance with Rule 6c-7, in connection with the registrants obtaining 
from a purchaser, prior to or at the time of purchase, a signed 
document acknowledging the restrictions on redeemability imposed by 
Texas law, is estimated to be approximately 3 minutes of professional 
time per response for each of approximately 5,900 purchasers annually 
(at an estimated $84 per hour),\1\ for a total annual burden of 295 
hours (at a total annual cost of $24,780).
---------------------------------------------------------------------------

    \1\ $84/hour figure for a Compliance Clerk is based on the 
Commission's estimates concerning the allocation of burden hours and 
the relevant wage rates from the Commission's consultations with 
industry representatives and on salary information for the 
securities industry compiled by the Securities Industry and 
Financial Markets Association's Office Salaries in the Securities 
Industry 2013; the estimated wage figures are modified by Commission 
staff to account for an 1800-hour work-year and multiplied by 2.93 
to account for bonuses, firm size, employee benefits, overhead, and 
adjusted to account for the effects of inflation; see Securities 
Industry and Financial Markets Association, Report on Management & 
Professional Earnings in the Securities Industry 2013.
---------------------------------------------------------------------------

    The estimate of average burden hours is made solely for the 
purposes of the Paperwork Reduction Act, and is not derived from a 
comprehensive or even a representative survey or study of the costs of 
Commission rules or forms. The Commission does not include in the 
estimate of average burden hours the time preparing registration 
statements and sales literature disclosure regarding the restrictions 
on redeem ability imposed by Texas law. The estimate of burden hours 
for completing the relevant registration statements are reported on the 
separate PRA submissions for those statements. (See the separate PRA 
submissions for Form N-3 (17 CFR 274.11b) and Form N-4 (17 CFR 
274.11c).)
    Written comments are invited on: (a) whether the proposed 
collection of information is necessary for the proper performance of 
the functions of the Commission, including whether the information 
shall have practical utility; (b) the accuracy of the Commission's 
estimate of the burden of the collection of information; (c) ways to 
enhance the quality, utility, and clarity of the information collected; 
and (d) ways to minimize the burden of the collection of information on 
respondents, including through the use of automated collection 
techniques or other forms of information technology. Consideration will 
be given to comments and suggestions submitted by August 27, 2024.
    An agency may not conduct or sponsor, and a person is not required 
to respond to, a collection of information under the PRA unless it 
displays a currently valid OMB control number.
    Please direct your written comments to: David Bottom, Chief 
Information Officer, Securities and Exchange Commission, c/o John 
Pezzullo, 100 F Street, NE Washington, DC 20549 or send an email to:

Vanessa A. Countryman,
Secretary.
