SECURITIES AND EXCHANGE COMMISSION

[SEC File No. 270-253, OMB Control No. 3235-0260]


Proposed Collection; Comment Request; Extension: Rule 23c-1

Upon Written Request, Copies Available From: Securities and Exchange 
Commission, Office of FOIA Services, 100 F Street NE, Washington, DC 
20549-2736

    Notice is hereby given that, pursuant to the Paperwork Reduction 
Act of 1995 (44 U.S.C. 3501-3520), the Securities and Exchange 
Commission (the ``Commission'') is soliciting comments on the 
collection of information summarized below. The Commission plans to 
submit this existing collection of information to the Office of 
Management and Budget for extension and approval.
    Rule 23c-1(a) under the Investment Company Act (17 CFR 270.23c-
1(a)) permits a closed-end fund to repurchase its securities for cash 
if, in addition to the other requirements set forth in the rule, the 
following conditions are met: (i) payment of the purchase price is 
accompanied or preceded by a written confirmation of the purchase 
(``written confirmation''); (ii) the asset coverage per unit of the 
security to be purchased is disclosed to the seller or his agent 
(``asset coverage disclosure''); and (iii) if the security is a stock, 
the fund has, within the preceding six months, informed stockholders of 
its intention to purchase stock (``six month notice''). Commission 
staff estimates that 48 closed-end funds undertake a total of 192 
repurchases annually under rule 23c-1.\1\ Staff estimates further that, 
with respect to each repurchase, each fund

[[Page 66163]]

spends 2.5 hours to comply with the rule's written confirmation, asset 
coverage disclosure and six month notice requirements. Thus, Commission 
staff estimates the total annual respondent reporting burden is 480 
hours.\2\ Commission staff further estimates that the cost of the 
hourly burden per repurchase is approximately $388 (one half hour of a 
compliance attorney's time at $440 per hour,\3\ and two hours of 
clerical time at $84 per hour \4\). The total annual cost for all funds 
is estimated to be $186,240.\5\
---------------------------------------------------------------------------

    \1\ The number of closed-end funds that undertake repurchases 
annually under rule 23c-1 is based on information provided in 
response to Item C.7.i of Form N-CEN from January 1, 2023 through 
December 31, 2023; we estimate that each of the 48 funds undertook 
an average of 4 repurchases annually (48 funds x 4 repurchases = 192 
repurchases annually).
    \2\ This estimate is based on the following calculation: 192 
repurchases x 2.5 hours per repurchase = 480 hours.
    \3\ The $440/hour figure for a compliance attorney is from 
SIFMA's Management & Professional Earnings in the Securities 
Industry 2013, modified by Commission staff to account for an 1,800-
hour work-year and inflation, and multiplied by 5.35 to account for 
bonuses, firm size, employee benefits and overhead.
    \4\ The $84/hour figure for a compliance clerk is from SIFMA's 
Office Salaries in the Securities Industry 2013, modified by 
Commission staff to account for an 1,800-hour work-year and 
inflation, and multiplied by 2.93 to account for bonuses, firm size, 
employee benefits and overhead.
    \5\ This estimate is based on the following calculation: 192 
repurchases x 2.5 hours per repurchase x $388 hourly cost = 
$186,240.
---------------------------------------------------------------------------

    In addition, the fund must file with the Commission a copy of any 
written solicitation to purchase securities given by or on behalf of 
the fund to 10 or more persons. The copy must be filed as an exhibit to 
Form N-CSR (17 CFR 249.331and 274.128).\6\ The burden associated with 
filing Form N-CSR is addressed in the submission related to that form.
---------------------------------------------------------------------------

    \6\ In addition, Item 9 of Form N-CSR requires closed-end funds 
to disclose information similar to the information that was required 
in Form N-23C-1, which was discontinued in 2004.
---------------------------------------------------------------------------

    The estimate of average burden hours is made solely for the 
purposes of the Paperwork Reduction Act, and is not derived from a 
comprehensive or even a representative survey or study of the costs of 
Commission rules and forms.
    Written comments are invited on: (a) whether the proposed 
collection of information is necessary for the proper performance of 
the functions of the Commission, including whether the information 
shall have practical utility; (b) the accuracy of the Commission's 
estimate of the burden of the collection of information; (c) ways to 
enhance the quality, utility, and clarity of the information collected; 
and (d) ways to minimize the burden of the collection of information on 
respondents, including through the use of automated collection 
techniques or other forms of information technology. Consideration will 
be given to comments and suggestions submitted by October 15, 2024.
    An agency may not conduct or sponsor, and a person is not required 
to respond to, a collection of information under the PRA unless it 
displays a currently valid OMB control number.
    Please direct your written comments to: Austin Gerig, Director/
Chief Data Officer, Securities and Exchange Commission, c/o Oluwaseun 
Ajayi, 100 F Street NE, Washington, DC 20549 or send an email to:

Vanessa A. Countryman,
Secretary.
