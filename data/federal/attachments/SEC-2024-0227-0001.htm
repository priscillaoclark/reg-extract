Self-Regulatory Organizations; Miami International Securities

    Pursuant to the provisions of Section 19(b)(1) of the Securities 
Exchange Act of 1934 (``Act'') \1\ and Rule 19b-4 thereunder,\2\ notice 
is hereby given that on February 1, 2024, Miami International 
Securities Exchange LLC (``MIAX'' or ``Exchange'') filed with the 
Securities and Exchange Commission (``Commission'') a proposed rule 
change as described in Items I and II below, which Items have been 
prepared by the Exchange. The Commission is publishing this notice to 
solicit comments on the proposed rule change from interested persons.
---------------------------------------------------------------------------

    \1\ 15 U.S.C. 78s(b)(1).
    \2\ 17 CFR 240.19b-4.
---------------------------------------------------------------------------

I. Self-Regulatory Organization's Statement of the Terms of Substance 
of the Proposed Rule Change

    The Exchange is filing a proposal to update an internal cross 
reference in Rule 404, Series of Option Contracts Open for Trading.
    The text of the proposed rule change is available on the Exchange's 
website at <a href="http://www.miaxoptions.com/rule-filings">http://www.miaxoptions.com/rule-filings</a>, at MIAX's principal 
office, and at the Commission's Public Reference Room.

II. Self-Regulatory Organization's Statement of the Purpose of, and 
Statutory Basis for, the Proposed Rule Change

    In its filing with the Commission, the Exchange included statements 
concerning the purpose of and basis for the proposed rule change and 
discussed any comments it received on the proposed rule change. The 
text of these statements may be examined at the places specified in 
Item IV below. The Exchange has prepared summaries, set forth in 
sections A, B, and C below, of the most significant aspects of such 
statements.

A. Self-Regulatory Organization's Statement of the Purpose of, and 
Statutory Basis for, the Proposed Rule Change

1. Purpose
    The Exchange proposes to update an internal cross reference in 
paragraph (a) of Rule 404, Series of Option Contracts Open for 
Trading.\3\ Specifically, the Exchange proposes to amend the last 
sentence of paragraph (a) which provides that, for Monthly Options 
Series, the Exchange will fix a specific expiration date and exercise 
price, as provided in Interpretation and Policy .12. The Exchange now 
proposes to correct the internal cross reference from Interpretation 
and Policy .12 to Interpretation and Policy .13. Interpretation and 
Policy .13 describes the Monthly Option Series Program and is the 
correct internal cross reference for paragraph (a).
---------------------------------------------------------------------------

    \3\ The Exchange notes that all the rules of Chapter IV of the 
MIAX Options Exchange, including Rule 404, are incorporated by 
reference to MIAX Emerald.
---------------------------------------------------------------------------

2. Statutory Basis
    The Exchange believes the proposed rules changes are consistent 
with the Act and the rules and regulations thereunder applicable to the 
Exchange and, in particular, the requirements of Section 6(b) of the 
Act.\4\ Specifically, the Exchange believes the proposed rules changes 
are consistent with Section 6(b)(5) \5\ requirements that the rules of 
an exchange be designed to prevent fraudulent and manipulative acts and 
practices, to promote just and equitable principles of trade, to foster 
cooperation and coordination with persons engaged in regulating, 
clearing, settling, processing information with respect to, and 
facilitating transactions in securities, to remove impediments to and 
perfect the mechanism of a free and open market and a national market 
system, and, in general, to protect investors and the public interest.
---------------------------------------------------------------------------

    \4\ 15 U.S.C. 78f(b).
    \5\ 15 U.S.C. 78f(b)(5).
---------------------------------------------------------------------------

    The Exchange believes that the proposed change to its rules to 
correct an internal cross reference would remove impediments to and 
perfect the mechanism of a free and open market and a national market 
system because the proposed change is designed to update correct an 
erroneous internal cross reference. The Exchange believes that Members 
\6\ would benefit from the increased clarity, thereby reducing 
potential confusion and ensuring that those subject to the Exchange's 
jurisdiction, regulators, and the investing public can more easily 
navigate and understand the Exchange's rules. The Exchange further 
believes that the proposed changes would not be inconsistent with the 
public interest and the protection of investors because investors will 
not be harmed and in fact would benefit from increased clarity, thereby 
reducing potential confusion.
---------------------------------------------------------------------------

    \6\ The term ``Member'' means an individual or organization 
approved to exercise the trading rights associated with a Trading 
Permit. Members are deemed ``members'' under the Exchange Act. See 
Exchange Rule 100.
---------------------------------------------------------------------------

B. Self-Regulatory Organization's Statement on Burden on Competition

    The Exchange believes that the proposed rules changes would not 
impose any burden on competition that is not necessary or appropriate 
in furtherance of the purposes of the Act. The proposed rules change is 
not intended to address a competitive issue but rather would modify an 
Exchange rule to update an incorrect cross reference. Since the 
proposal does not substantively modify System \7\ functionality or 
processes on the Exchange, the proposed changes will not impose any 
burden on competition nor are they meant to affect competition among 
the exchanges. For these reasons, the Exchange believes that the 
proposed rules change reflects this competitive environment and does 
not impose any

[[Page 12893]]

undue burden on intermarket competition.
---------------------------------------------------------------------------

    \7\ The term ``System'' means the automated trading system used 
by the Exchange for the trading of securities. See Exchange Rule 
100.
---------------------------------------------------------------------------

C. Self-Regulatory Organization's Statement on Comments on the Proposed 
Rule Change Received From Members, Participants, or Others

    Written comments were neither solicited nor received.

III. Date of Effectiveness of the Proposed Rule Change and Timing for 
Commission Action

    Because the foregoing proposed rule change does not: (i) 
significantly affect the protection of investors or the public 
interest; (ii) impose any significant burden on competition; and (iii) 
become operative for 30 days from the date on which it was filed, or 
such shorter time as the Commission may designate, it has become 
effective pursuant to Section 19(b)(3)(A) of the Act \8\ and 
subparagraph (f)(6) of Rule 19b-4 thereunder.\9\
---------------------------------------------------------------------------

    \8\ 15 U.S.C. 78s(b)(3)(A).
    \9\ 17 CFR 240.19b-4(f)(6). In addition, Rule 19b-4(f)(6) 
requires a self-regulatory organization to give the Commission 
written notice of its intent to file the proposed rule change, along 
with a brief description and text of the proposed rule change, at 
least five business days prior to the date of filing of the proposed 
rule change, or such shorter time as designated by the Commission. 
The Exchange has satisfied this requirement.
---------------------------------------------------------------------------

    A proposed rule change filed pursuant to Rule 19b-4(f)(6) under the 
Act \10\ normally does not become operative for 30 days after the date 
of its filing. However, Rule 19b-4(f)(6)(iii) \11\ permits the 
Commission to designate a shorter time if such action is consistent 
with the protection of investors and the public interest. The Exchange 
has requested that the Commission waive the 30-day operative delay so 
that the proposal may become operative immediately upon filing. The 
Exchange states that a waiver of the operative delay would permit the 
Exchange to promptly correct an erroneous internal cross reference. The 
Commission believes that the proposed rule change presents no novel 
legal or regulatory issues and that waiver of the 30-day operative 
delay is consistent with the protection of investors and the public 
interest. Accordingly, the Commission hereby waives the 30-day 
operative delay and designates the proposed rule change operative upon 
filing.\12\
---------------------------------------------------------------------------

    \10\ 17 CFR 240.19b-4(f)(6).
    \11\ 17 CFR 240.19b-4(f)(6)(iii).
    \12\ For purposes only of waiving the 30-day operative delay, 
the Commission has also considered the proposed rule's impact on 
efficiency, competition, and capital formation. See 15 U.S.C. 
78c(f).
---------------------------------------------------------------------------

    At any time within 60 days of the filing of the proposed rule 
change, the Commission summarily may temporarily suspend such rule 
change if it appears to the Commission that such action is necessary or 
appropriate in the public interest, for the protection of investors, or 
otherwise in furtherance of the purposes of the Act. If the Commission 
takes such action, the Commission shall institute proceedings to 
determine whether the proposed rule should be approved or disapproved.
