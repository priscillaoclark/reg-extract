Background

    The Kingpin Act became law on December 3, 1999. The Kingpin Act 
establishes a program targeting the activities of significant foreign 
narcotics traffickers and their organizations on a worldwide basis. It 
provides a statutory framework for the President to impose sanctions 
against significant foreign narcotics traffickers and their 
organizations on a worldwide basis, with the objective of denying their 
businesses and agents access to the U.S. financial system and the 
benefits of trade and transactions involving U.S. companies and 
individuals.
    The Kingpin Act blocks all property and interests in property, 
subject to U.S. jurisdiction, owned or controlled by significant 
foreign narcotics traffickers as identified by the President. In 
addition, the Secretary of the Treasury consults with the Attorney 
General, the Director of the Central Intelligence Agency, the Director 
of the Federal Bureau of Investigation, the Administrator of the Drug 
Enforcement Administration, the Secretary of Defense, the Secretary of 
State, and the Secretary of Homeland Security when designating and 
blocking the property and interests in property, subject to U.S. 
jurisdiction, of persons who are found to be: (1) Materially assisting 
in, or providing financial or technological support for or to, or 
providing goods or services in support of, the international narcotics 
trafficking activities of a person designated pursuant to the Kingpin 
Act; (2) owned, controlled, or directed by, or acting for or on behalf 
of, a person designated pursuant to the Kingpin Act; or (3) playing a 
significant role in international narcotics trafficking.
    On July 15, 2010 the Director of OFAC published supplementary 
identifying information for one previously-designated individual whose 
property and interests in property are blocked pursuant to section 
805(b) of the Foreign Narcotics Kingpin Designation Act.
    The original listing is as follows:
    1. URREGO ESCUDERO, Carlos Agustin, Colombia; DOB 19 Feb 1976; 
Citizen Colombia; Cedula No. 79928745 (Colombia); Passport AF392658 
(Colombia); (INDIVIDUAL) [SDNTK].
