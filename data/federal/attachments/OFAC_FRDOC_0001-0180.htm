Background

    On August 30, 2010, the President signed Executive Order 13551 (the 
``Order'') pursuant to, inter alia, the International Emergency 
Economic Powers Act (50 U.S.C. 1701 et seq.), section 5 of the United 
Nations Participation Act of 1945, as amended (22 U.S.C. 287c), the 
National Emergencies Act (50 U.S.C. 1601 et seq.), and section 301 of 
Title 3, United States Code. In the Order, the President found that the 
continued actions and policies of the Government of North Korea, 
manifested most recently by its unprovoked attack that resulted in the 
sinking of the Republic of Korea Navy Ship Cheonan and the deaths of 46 
sailors in March 2010, destabilize the Korean peninsula and imperil 
U.S. Armed Forces, allies, and trading partners in the region, and 
thereby constitute an unusual and extraordinary threat to the national 
security, foreign policy, and economy of the United States. The 
President identified in the Annex to the Order one individual and three 
entities as subject to the economic sanctions in the Order.
    Section 1 of the Order blocks, with certain exceptions, all 
property and interests in property that are in, or thereafter come 
within, the United States, or within the possession or control of 
United States persons, of the persons listed in the Annex, as well as 
those persons determined by the Secretary of the Treasury, in 
consultation with the Secretary of State, to meet any of the criteria 
set forth in subparagraphs (a)(i)-(a)(ii)(G) of Section 1.
