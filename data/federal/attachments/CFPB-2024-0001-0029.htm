SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION: The CFPB is making limited amendments to 
five rules to reflect a recent organizational change. The Division of 
Supervision, Enforcement, and Fair Lending has been replaced by two 
divisions, the Supervision Division and the Enforcement Division. The 
CFPB is transferring certain responsibilities under 12 CFR part 1070, 
which relate to disclosure of confidential supervisory information, 
from the associate director of the former division to the Supervision 
Director as head of the Supervision Division. The CFPB is also updating 
nomenclature across all five rules to reflect the establishment of the 
new divisions.
