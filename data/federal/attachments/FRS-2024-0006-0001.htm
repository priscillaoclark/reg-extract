SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION:

Federal Civil Penalties Inflation Adjustment Act

    The Federal Civil Penalties Inflation Adjustment Act of 1990, 28 
U.S.C. 2461 note (``FCPIA Act''), requires federal agencies to adjust, 
by regulation, the CMPs within their jurisdiction to account for 
inflation. The Federal Civil Penalties Inflation Adjustment Act 
Improvements Act of 2015 (the ``2015 Act'') \1\ amended the FCPIA Act 
to require federal agencies to make annual adjustments not later than 
January 15 of every year.\2\ The Board is now issuing a new final rule 
to set the CMP levels pursuant to the required annual adjustment for 
2024. The Board will apply these adjusted maximum penalty levels to any 
penalties assessed on or after [publication date], whose associated 
violations occurred on or after November 2, 2015. Penalties assessed 
for violations occurring prior to November 2, 2015, will be subject to 
the amounts set in the Board's 2012 adjustment pursuant to the FCPIA 
Act.\3\
---------------------------------------------------------------------------

    \1\ Public Law 114-74, 129 Stat. 599 (2015) (codified at 28 
U.S.C. 2461 note).

---------------------------------------------------------------------------

    Under the 2015 Act, the annual adjustment to be made for 2024 is 
the percentage by which the Consumer Price Index for the month of 
October 2023 exceeds the Consumer Price Index for the month of October 
2022. On December 19, 2023, as directed by the 2015 Act, the Office of 
Management and Budget (OMB) issued guidance to affected agencies on 
implementing the required annual adjustment which included the relevant 
inflation multiplier.\4\ Using OMB's multiplier, the Board calculated 
the adjusted penalties for its CMPs, rounding the penalties to the 
nearest dollar.\5\
---------------------------------------------------------------------------

    \4\ OMB Memorandum M-24-07, Implementation of Penalty Inflation 
Adjustments for 2024, Pursuant to the Federal Civil Penalties 
Inflation Adjustment Act Improvements Act of 2015 (Dec. 19, 2023).
    \5\ Under the 2015 Act and implementing OMB guidance, agencies 
are not required to make an adjustment to a CMP if, during the 12 
months preceding the required adjustment, such penalty increased due 
to a law other than the 2015 Act by an amount greater than the 
amount of the required adjustment. No other laws have adjusted the 
CMPs within the Board's jurisdiction during the preceding 12 months.
---------------------------------------------------------------------------

Administrative Procedure Act

    The 2015 Act states that agencies shall make the annual adjustment 
``notwithstanding section 553 of title 5, United States Code.'' 
Therefore, this rule is not subject to the provisions of the 
Administrative Procedure Act (the ``APA''), 5 U.S.C. 553, requiring 
notice, public participation, and deferred effective date.

Regulatory Flexibility Act

    The Regulatory Flexibility Act, 5 U.S.C. 601 et seq., requires a 
regulatory flexibility analysis only for rules for which an agency is 
required to publish a general notice of proposed rulemaking. Because 
the 2015 Act states that agencies' annual adjustments are to

[[Page 2115]]

be made notwithstanding section 553 of title 5 of United States Code--
the APA section requiring notice of proposed rulemaking--the Board is 
not publishing a notice of proposed rulemaking. Therefore, the 
Regulatory Flexibility Act does not apply.

Paperwork Reduction Act

    There is no collection of information required by this final rule 
that would be subject to the Paperwork Reduction Act of 1995, 44 U.S.C. 
3501 et seq.

Sec.  263.65   Civil money penalty inflation adjustments.

    (a) Inflation adjustments. In accordance with the Federal Civil

adjusted maximum amounts for each civil money penalty provided by law 
within the Board's jurisdiction. The authorizing statutes contain the

occurred on or after November 2, 2015.
    (b) Maximum civil money penalties. The maximum (or, in the cases of
