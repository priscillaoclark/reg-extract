II. Background

    The Federal Housing Finance Regulatory Reform Act of 2008 (Reform 
Act), which was passed as Division A of the Housing and Economic 
Recovery Act of 2008 (HERA) abolished both the Federal Housing Finance 
Board (FHFB), an independent agency that oversaw the Federal Home Loan 
Banks (FHLBanks), and the Office of Federal Housing Enterprise 
Oversight (OFHEO), an office within the Department of Housing and Urban 
Development (HUD) that oversaw the ``safety and soundness'' of the 
Federal Home Loan Mortgage Corporation (Freddie Mac) and the Federal 
National Mortgage Association (Fannie Mae). See Public Law 110-289, 
sections 1301 and 1311, 122 Stat. 2654, 2794 and 2797 (codified at 12 
U.S.C. 4511 note); H.R. Rep. No. 110-142, at 95. The Reform Act 
established in place of the FHFB and OFHEO a new entity, the Federal 
Housing Finance Agency (FHFA), to regulate and supervise Fannie Mae, 
Freddie Mac, and the 12 FHLBanks. See Public Law 110-289, section 1101, 
122 Stat. 2654, 2661 (codified at 12 U.S.C. 4511).
    The Reform Act also requires the appointment of an Inspector 
General within FHFA, in accordance with section 3a of the Inspector 
General Act of 1978 (the IG Act). See Public Law 110-289, section 1105, 
122 Stat. 2668 (codified at 12 U.S.C. 4517(d)). FHFA-OIG is responsible 
for, among other things, conducting audits, investigations, and 
evaluations of FHFA's programs and operations; recommending policies 
that promote economy and efficiency in the administration of FHFA's 
programs and operations; and preventing and detecting fraud and abuse 
in FHFA's programs and operations. See IG Act, Public Law 95-452, 92 
Stat. 1101 (codified at 5 U.S.C. App.).
    FHFA-OIG began operations in October of 2010. Although FHFA's SORs 
covered many of FHFA-OIG's records, some of those records were unique 
to FHFA-OIG's work. As a result, on March 2, 2011, FHFA-OIG issued a 
Federal Register notice establishing five SORs (76 FR 11465). On 
November 1, 2013, FHFA-OIG issued another Federal Register notice 
adding a new SOR and amending and updating the existing SORs (78 FR 
65644). In the five years since the last update, FHFA-OIG's approach to 
implementing its mission has evolved and matured. To better reflect 
where our work is taking us and how we conduct our business some 
aspects of the earlier SORs should be amended.
    Certain updates, rewording, and technical changes are being made to 
one or more of the following sections of the existing SORs: System 
name, system location, categories of individuals covered by the system, 
categories of records in the system, purpose(s), routine uses, 
retrievability, safeguards, retention and disposal, system manager(s) 
and address, notification procedures, record source categories, and 
exemptions claimed for the system. In addition, several new routine 
uses are being added to enable FHFA-OIG to implement its mission under 
the IG Act more efficiently and to enhance transparency in reporting 
the results of our audits, evaluations, investigations, and other 
inquiries.
    During the course of updating its existing SORs, FHFA-OIG 
determined that records concerning hotline complaints and inquiries 
conducted by

[[Page 13550]]

FHFA-OIG's Office of Investigations are already housed in the Office of 
Investigations' two existing SORs--FHFA-OIG-2 and FHFA-OIG-3. Thus, 
with regard to these types of complaints and inquiries, the existing 
Hotline Database (FHFA-OIG-4) is superfluous. FHFA-OIG is making minor 
modifications to reflect that hotline complaints and inquiries 
undertaken by the Office of Investigations are already covered by the 
two existing SORs (FHFA-OIG-2 and FHFA-OIG-3).
    Rather than eliminating the existing Hotline Database SOR (FHFA-
OIG-4), FHFA-OIG is repurposing it to house records pertaining to non-
criminal administrative inquiries conducted by any FHFA-OIG operational 
division other than the Office of Investigations. FHFA-OIG has assigned 
responsibility for non-criminal administrative inquiries to its 
operational divisions and desires records pertaining to these matters 
to be stored in a SOR separate from any SOR that contains investigative 
records generated and/or collected by FHFA-OIG's Office of 
Investigations. Thus, to better align its SORs with its 
multidisciplinary approach to these inquiries, FHFA-OIG is designating 
the existing Hotline Database (FHFA-OIG-4) to store records pertaining 
to non-criminal administrative inquiries that are conducted by any 
FHFA-OIG operational division other than the Office of Investigations.
    Finally, a SOR is being added for FHFA-OIG's Freedom of Information 
Act (FOIA), Privacy Act (PA), and Freedom of Information Act/Privacy 
Act (FOPA) records. Although FHFA-OIG's FOIA, PA, and FOPA records are 
covered under FHFA's FOIA and PA SOR, FHFA-OIG has decided to adopt its 
own SOR for FOIA, PA, and FOPA records so that the routine uses for 
these records are aligned with the routine uses for FHFA-OIG's other 
SORs. Because documents FHFA-OIG produces in response to FOIA, PA, and 
FOPA requests are often records that are contained in FHFA-OIG's other 
SORs, it is more logical for FHFA-OIG's FOIA, PA, and FOPA routine uses 
to mirror those of the SORs from which these records may originate. 
Thus, the main reason FHFA-OIG is creating a SOR for its FOIA, PA, and 
FOPA records is to achieve this symbiosis. FHFA-OIG is also creating 
this SOR to make clear that some requests are processed under both the 
FOIA and PA. FHFA-OIG believes it is more appropriate that its SOR 
reflect this hybrid category of records (i.e., FOPA).
    Sections 552a(e)(4) and (11) of title 5, United States Code, 
require that an agency publish a notice of the establishment or 
revision of a SOR which affords the public a 30-day period in which to 
submit comments. To meet this requirement, FHFA-OIG's SORs are set 
forth in their entirety below. Further, a report of FHFA-OIG's 
intention to amend and supplement its routine uses, update other 
portions of its existing SORs, and add a new SOR has been submitted to 
the Committee on Oversight and Government Reform of the House of 
Representatives, the Committee on Homeland Security and Governmental 
Affairs of the Senate, and to OMB, as required by the Privacy Act, 5 
U.S.C. 552a(r) and pursuant to section 7 of OMB Circular A-108, 
``Federal Agency Responsibilities for Review, Reporting, and 
Publication under the Privacy Act,'' dated December 23, 2016 (81 FR 
94424 (Dec. 23, 2016)).

alternate work site utilized by FHFA-OIG employees or by individuals 
assisting such employees.

SYSTEM MANAGER(S):
    Deputy Inspector General for Audits, Office of Inspector General, 
Federal Housing Finance Agency, 400 7th Street SW, Washington, DC

4517(d) and 5 U.S.C. App. 3.

PURPOSE(S) OF THE SYSTEM:
    This system is maintained to enable Office of Audits' employees to 
access, share, restrict, or maintain information that has been 
collected and/or generated as part of an audit, as appropriate. 
Materials relating to an audit may or may not become part of the 
official audit file. The system also serves as a storage and filing 
system for working copies, drafts, and final versions of documents 
collected and/or generated by the Office of Audits in the performance 
of other official duties.

CATEGORIES OF INDIVIDUALS COVERED BY THE SYSTEM:
    Employees of and detailees to the Office of Audits and subjects or 
potential subjects of audit activities and individuals who may be, are,

inquiry processes or is necessary to demonstrate the accountability of 
FHFA-OIG employees, officers or individuals covered by the system, 
unless the Inspector General or his/her delegee determines, after 
consultation with counsel and the Senior Privacy Official, that release 
of the specific information in the context of a particular case would 
constitute an unwarranted invasion of personal privacy;
    (15) To Congress, congressional committees, or the staffs thereof,
