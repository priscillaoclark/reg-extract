Self-Regulatory Organizations; NYSE American LLC; Notice of 
Filing and Immediate Effectiveness of Proposed Change To Amend the NYSE 
American Options Proprietary Market Data Fee Schedule

November 15, 2023.
    Pursuant to Section 19(b)(1) \1\ of the Securities Exchange Act of 
1934 (``Act'') \2\ and Rule 19b-4 thereunder,\3\ notice is hereby given 
that, on November 1, 2023, NYSE American LLC (``NYSE American'' or 
``Exchange'') filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission 
(``Commission'') the proposed rule change as described in Items I, II, 
and III below, which Items have been prepared by the self-regulatory 
organization. The Commission is publishing this notice to solicit 
comments on the proposed rule change from interested persons.

I. Self-Regulatory Organization's Statement of the Terms of Substance 
of the Proposed Rule Change

    The Exchange proposes to amend the NYSE American Options 
Proprietary Market Data Fee Schedule (``Fee Schedule'') to adopt fees 
for the NYSE Options Open-Close Volume Summary market data product, 
effective November 1, 2023. The proposed rule change is available on 
the Exchange's website at <a href="http://www.nyse.com">www.nyse.com</a>, at the principal office of the 
Exchange, and at the Commission's Public Reference Room.

II. Self-Regulatory Organization's Statement of the Purpose of, and 
Statutory Basis for, the Proposed Rule Change

    In its filing with the Commission, the self-regulatory organization 
included statements concerning the purpose of, and basis for, the 
proposed rule change and discussed any comments it received on the 
proposed rule change. The text of those statements may be examined at 
the places specified in Item IV below. The Exchange has prepared 
summaries, set forth in sections A, B, and C below, of the most 
significant parts of such statements.

A. Self-Regulatory Organization's Statement of the Purpose of, and the 
Statutory Basis for, the Proposed Rule Change

1. Purpose
    The Exchange proposes to amend the Fee Schedule to adopt fees for 
the NYSE Options Open-Close Volume Summary,\4\ which will be available 
for purchase by any market participant, i.e., members \5\ and non-
members. The Exchange proposes to implement fees for the NYSE Options 
Open-Close Volume Summary market data product on November 1, 2023.\6\ 
The proposed fees would be applied equally to all market participants 
and all market participants would receive the same information in the 
data feed.
---------------------------------------------------------------------------

    \4\ See Securities Exchange Act Release No. 93803 (December 16, 
2021), 86 FR 72647 (December 22, 2021) (SR-NYSEAMER-2021-46) (Notice 
of Filing and Immediate Effectiveness of Proposed Rule Change to 
Adopt a New Historical Market Data Product to Be Known as the NYSE 
Options Open-Close Volume Summary) (``Product Filing'').
    \5\ References to ``member organization'' as used in Exchange 
rules include American Trading Permit (``ATP'') Holders, which are 
registered brokers or dealers approved to effect transactions on the 
Exchange's options marketplace. Under the Exchange's rules, an ATP 
Holder has the status as a ``member'' of the Exchange as that term 
is defined in Section 3 of the Act. See Rule 900.2NY.
    \6\ The Exchange has announced that it will begin [sic] 
migrating Exchange-listed options to the Pillar technology platform 
on October 23, 2023, available here: <a href="https://www.nyse.com/trader-update/history?page=5#110000635130">https://www.nyse.com/trader-update/history?page=5#110000635130</a>.
---------------------------------------------------------------------------

Background
    By way of background, pursuant to the Product Filing, the Exchange 
adopted two versions of the NYSE Options Open-Close Volume Summary: an 
End of Day Volume Summary market data product and an Intra-Day Volume 
Summary market data product. The Exchange initially introduced the End 
of Day Volume Summary market data product on March 1, 2022 and adopted 
fees for the End of Day Volume Summary market data product.\7\ The 
purpose of this filing is to adopt fees for the Intra-Day Volume 
Summary market data product.
---------------------------------------------------------------------------

    \7\ See Securities Exchange Act Release No. 94334 (March 1, 
2022), 87 FR 12748 (March 7, 2022) (SR-NYSEAMER-2022-11) (Notice of 
Filing and Immediate Effectiveness of Proposed Change To Amend the 
NYSE American Options Proprietary Market Data Fee Schedule).
---------------------------------------------------------------------------

    The Intra-Day Volume Summary provides a volume summary of trading 
activity on the Exchange at the option level by origin (Customer, 
Professional Customer, Firm, Broker-Dealer, and Market Maker \8\), side 
of the market (buy or sell), contract volume, and transaction type 
(opening or closing). The Customer, Professional Customer, Firm, 
Broker-Dealer, and Market Maker volume is further broken down into 
trade size buckets (less than 100 contracts, 100-199 contracts, greater 
than 199 contracts). The Intra-Day Volume Summary provides similar 
information to that of the End of Day Volume Summary but is produced 
and updated every 10 minutes during the trading day. The data is 
captured in ``snapshots'' taken every 10 minutes throughout the trading 
day and will be available to subscribers within five minutes of the 
conclusion of each 10-minute period. Each update would represent 
combined data captured from the current ``snapshot'' and all previous 
``snapshots'' and thus would provide open-close data on an aggregate 
basis.
---------------------------------------------------------------------------

    \8\ The terms Customer, Professional Customer, Firm and Market 
Maker are defined in Rule 900.2NY.
---------------------------------------------------------------------------

    The NYSE Options Open-Close Volume Summary is proprietary Exchange 
trade data and does not include trade data from any other exchange. It 
is also a historical data product and not a real-time data feed.
    The Exchange anticipates a wide variety of market participants to 
purchase the Intra-Day Volume Summary data product, including, but not 
limited to, individual customers, buy-side investors, and investment 
banks. The Exchange believes the Intra-Day Volume Summary would provide 
subscribers data that should enhance their ability to analyze options 
trade and volume data, and to create and test trading models and 
analytical strategies. The Exchange believes the Intra-Day Volume 
Summary will be a valuable tool that subscribers can use to gain 
comprehensive insight into the trading activity in a particular options 
series. The Intra-Day Volume Summary is a completely voluntary product, 
in that the Exchange is not required by any rule or regulation to make 
this data available and that potential subscribers may

[[Page 81158]]

purchase it only if they voluntarily choose to do so. The Exchange 
notes that other exchanges offer a similar product,\9\ including the 
Exchange's affiliate, NYSE Arca, Inc. (NYSE Arca'').\10\

Filing and Immediate Effectiveness of Proposed Rule Change to Amend

---------------------------------------------------------------------------

    The Intra-Day Volume Summary is subject to direct competition from 
similar end of day options trading summaries offered by other options 
exchanges.\11\ All of these exchanges offer essentially the same intra 
day options trading summary information. The options trading summary 
files offered by the Exchange's competitors are substitutes, not 
complements. The Intra-Day Volume Summary provides data on options 
market activity which can be used to infer longer-term trends. The 
information provided by one exchange is generally similar to that 
provided by other exchanges because order flow can move from one 
exchange to another, and market sentiment trends that appear on one 
exchange are likely to be similar to the sentiment trends on other 
exchanges. The key differentiator in the quality of the data depends on 
the volume of transactions on a given exchange. The greater the volume 
of transactions, the greater the value of the data.
---------------------------------------------------------------------------

    \11\ See supra note 9 [sic].
---------------------------------------------------------------------------

Proposed Rule Change
    The Exchange proposes to adopt subscription fees for the purchase 
of the Intra-Day Volume Summary on a monthly basis. The Exchange 
proposes to assess a fee of $2,000 per month for subscribing to the 
Intra-Day Volume Summary. As noted on the Fee Schedule, for mid-month 
subscriptions, new subscribers will be charged for the full calendar 
month for which they subscribe and will be provided NYSE Options Open-
Close Volume Summary data for each trading day of the calendar month in 
which they subscribed. The proposed monthly fees will apply to all 
market participants. The Exchange notes that other exchanges provide 
similar data products that may be purchased on a monthly basis and are 
comparably priced.\12\

---------------------------------------------------------------------------

2. Statutory Basis
    The Exchange believes that the proposed rule change is consistent 
with Section 6(b) of the Act,\13\ in general, and furthers the 
objectives of Section 6(b)(5) of the Act,\14\ in particular, in that it 
is designed to prevent fraudulent and manipulative acts and practices, 
to promote just and equitable principles of trade, to remove 
impediments to and perfect the mechanism of a free and open market and 
a national market system, and to protect investors and the public 
interest, and that it is not designed to permit unfair discrimination 
among customers, brokers, or dealers. The Exchange also believes that 
its proposal to adopt fees for the Intra-Day Volume Summary market data 
product is consistent with Section 6(b) of the Act \15\ in general, and 
furthers the objectives of Section 6(b)(4) of the Act \16\ in 
particular, in that it is an equitable allocation of dues, fees and 
other charges among its members and other recipients of Exchange data.

    \16\ 15 U.S.C. 78f(b)(4).
---------------------------------------------------------------------------

    In adopting Regulation NMS, the Commission granted self-regulatory 
organizations (``SROs'') and broker-dealers increased authority and 
flexibility to offer new and unique market data to the public. It was 
believed that this authority would expand the amount of data available 
to users and consumers of such data and also spur innovation and 
competition for the provision of market data. Particularly, the Intra-
Day Volume Summary further broadens the availability of U.S. options 
market data to investors consistent with the principles of Regulation 
NMS. Subscribers to the data may also be able to enhance their ability 
to analyze options trade and volume data and create and test trading 
models and analytical strategies. The Exchange believes the Intra-Day 
Volume Summary would provide a valuable tool that subscribers can use 
to gain comprehensive insight into the trading activity in a particular 
series, but also emphasizes such data is not necessary for trading. 
Moreover, other exchanges offer a similar data product.\17\
---------------------------------------------------------------------------

    \17\ See supra notes 9 and 10.
---------------------------------------------------------------------------

    The Exchange operates in a highly competitive market. Indeed, there 
are currently 17 registered options exchanges competing for order flow. 
Based on publicly-available information, and excluding index-based 
options, no single exchange has more than 16% of the market share of 
executed volume of multiply-listed equity and ETF options trades.\18\ 
Therefore, currently no exchange possesses significant pricing power in 
the execution of multiply-listed equity and ETF options order flow. 
More specifically, in July 2023, the Exchange had less than 8% market 
share of executed volume of multiply-listed equity and ETF options 
trades.\19\
---------------------------------------------------------------------------

    \18\ The Options Clearing Corporation (``OCC'') publishes 
options and futures volume in a variety of formats, including daily 
and monthly volume by exchange, available here: <a href="https://www.theocc.com/Market-Data/Market-Data-Reports/Volume-and-Open-Interest/Monthly-Weekly-Volume-Statistics">https://www.theocc.com/Market-Data/Market-Data-Reports/Volume-and-Open-Interest/Monthly-Weekly-Volume-Statistics</a>.
    \19\ Based on OCC data for monthly volume of equity-based 
options and monthly volume of ETF-based options, see id., the 
Exchange's market share in equity-based options decreased from 7.26% 
for the month of July 2022 to 7.09% for the month of July 2023.
---------------------------------------------------------------------------

    The Commission has repeatedly expressed its preference for 
competition over regulatory intervention in determining prices, 
products, and services in the securities markets. Specifically, in 
Regulation NMS, the Commission highlighted the importance of market 
forces in determining prices

[[Page 81159]]

and SRO revenues, and also recognized that current regulation of the 
market system ``has been remarkably successful in promoting market 
competition in its broader forms that are most important to investors 
and listed companies.'' \20\
---------------------------------------------------------------------------

    \20\ See Securities Exchange Act Release No. 51808 (June 9, 
2005), 70 FR 37496, 37499 (June 29, 2005).
---------------------------------------------------------------------------

    With respect to market data, the decision of the United States 
Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia Circuit in NetCoalition 
v. SEC upheld the Commission's reliance on the existence of competitive 
market mechanisms to evaluate the reasonableness and fairness of fees 
for proprietary market data:

    In fact, the legislative history indicates that the Congress 
intended that the market system ``evolve through the interplay of 
competitive forces as unnecessary regulatory restrictions are 
removed'' and that the SEC wield its regulatory power ``in those 
situations where competition may not be sufficient,'' such as in the 
creation of a ``consolidated transactional reporting system.'' \21\
---------------------------------------------------------------------------

    \21\ NetCoalition v. SEC, 615 F.3d 525, 535 (D.C. Cir. 2010) 
(quoting H.R. Rep. No. 94-229 at 92 (1975), as reprinted in 1975 
U.S.C.C.A.N. 323).

    The court agreed with the Commission's conclusion that ``Congress 
intended that `competitive forces should dictate the services and 
practices that constitute the U.S. national market system for trading 
equity securities.' '' \22\
---------------------------------------------------------------------------

    \22\ Id. at 535.
---------------------------------------------------------------------------

    More recently, the Commission confirmed that it applies a ``market-
based'' test in its assessment of market data fees, and that under that 
test:

the Commission considers whether the exchange was subject to 
significant competitive forces in setting the terms of its proposal 
for [market data], including the level of any fees. If an exchange 
meets this burden, the Commission will find that its fee rule is 
consistent with the Act unless there is a substantial countervailing 
basis to find that the terms of the rule violate the Act or the 
rules thereunder.\23\
---------------------------------------------------------------------------

    \23\ See Securities Exchange Act Release No. 34-90217 (October 
16, 2020), 85 FR 67392 (October 22, 2020) (SR-NYSENAT-2020-05) 
(internal quotation marks omitted), quoting Securities Exchange Act 
Release No. 59039 (December 2, 2008), 73 FR 74770, 74781 (December 
9, 2008) (ArcaBook Approval Order).

    Making similar historic data products available to market 
participants fosters competition in the marketplace, and constrains the 
ability of exchanges to charge supra-competitive fees. In the event 
that a market participant views one exchange's data product as more or 
less attractive than the competition they can and do switch between 
similar products. The proposed fees are a result of the competitive 
environment, as the Exchange seeks to adopt fees to attract purchasers 
of the Intra-Day Volume Summary data product.
    The Exchange believes the proposed fees are reasonable as they are 
comparable to the fees assessed by other exchanges that provide similar 
data products.\24\ Indeed, proposing fees that are excessively higher 
than established fees for similar data products would simply serve to 
reduce demand for the Exchange's data product, which as noted, is 
entirely optional. Like the Intra-Day Volume Summary, other exchanges 
offer similar data products that each provide insight into trading on 
those markets and may likewise aid in assessing investor sentiment. 
Although each of these similar data products provide only proprietary 
trade data and not trade data from other exchanges, it is possible 
investors are still able to gauge overall investor sentiment across 
different option series based on open and closing interest on any one 
exchange. Similarly, market participants may be able to analyze option 
trade and volume data, and create and test trading models and 
analytical strategies using only the Intra-Day Volume Summary data 
relating to trading activity on one or more of the other markets that 
provide similar data products. As such, if a market participant views 
another exchange's data as more attractive than the Exchange's data 
product, then such market participant can merely choose not to purchase 
the Exchange's data product and instead purchase another exchange's 
product, which offer similar data points, albeit based on that other 
market's trading activity.
---------------------------------------------------------------------------

    \24\ See supra note 12.
---------------------------------------------------------------------------

    The Exchange also believes the proposed fees are reasonable as they 
would support the introduction of a new historic market data product 
that is designed to aid investors by providing insight into trading on 
the Exchange. Once the Intra-Day Volume Summary is made available, it 
would provide options market participants with valuable information 
about opening and closing transactions executed on the Exchange 
throughout the trading day, similar to other trade data products 
offered by competing options exchanges. In turn, this data would assist 
market participants in gauging investor sentiment and trading activity, 
resulting in potentially better-informed trading decisions. As noted 
above, subscribers may also use such data to create and test trading 
models and analytical strategies.
    Selling historic market data is also a means by which exchanges 
compete to attract business. To the extent that the Exchange is 
successful in attracting subscribers to the Exchange's historic data 
product, it may earn trading revenues and further enhance the value of 
its data products. If the market deems the proposed fees to be unfair 
or inequitable, subscribers can diminish or discontinue their use of 
the historic data and/or avail themselves of similar products offered 
by other exchanges.\25\ The Exchange therefore believes that the 
proposed fees reflect the competitive environment and would be properly 
and equally assessed to all subscribers. The Exchange also believes the 
proposed fees are equitable and not unfairly discriminatory as the fees 
would apply equally to all subscribers who choose to purchase such 
data. Nothing in this proposal treats any category of market 
participant any differently from any other category of market 
participant. The Intra-Day Volume Summary is available to all market 
participants, i.e., members and non-members, and all market 
participants would receive the same information in the data feed.
---------------------------------------------------------------------------

    \25\ See supra notes 9 and 10.
---------------------------------------------------------------------------

    As noted above, the Exchange anticipates a wide variety of market 
participants to purchase the Exchange's data product, including but not 
limited to individual customers, buy-side investors and investment 
banks. The Exchange reiterates that the decision as to whether or not 
to purchase the Intra-Day Volume Summary is entirely optional for all 
potential subscribers. Indeed, no market participant is required to 
purchase the data product, and the Exchange is not required to make the 
data product available to market participants. Rather, the Exchange is 
voluntarily making the Intra-Day Volume Summary data product available, 
as requested by customers, and market participants may choose to 
receive (and pay for) this data based on their own business needs. 
Potential subscribers may request the data at any time if they believe 
it to be valuable or may decline to purchase such data.
    In sum, the fierce competition for order flow constrains any 
exchange from pricing its historic market data at a supra-competitive 
price, and constrains the Exchange here in setting its fees for the 
Intra-Day Volume Summary data product. As described above, the 
Exchange's data product competes head-to-head with numerous products 
currently available in the marketplace. These products each serve as 
reasonable substitutes for one another as they are each designed to 
provide data on options market activity which can be used to infer 
longer-term trends. The information provided by one

[[Page 81160]]

exchange is generally similar to that provided by other exchanges 
because order flow can move from one exchange to another, and market 
sentiment trends that appear on one exchange are likely to be similar 
to the sentiment trends on other exchanges. The key differentiator in 
the quality of the data depends on the volume of transactions on a 
given exchange. The greater the volume of transactions, the greater the 
value of the historic data. The proposed fees are therefore reasonable 
because in setting them, the Exchange is constrained by the 
availability of numerous substitute venues offering historic market 
data products and trading. Such substitutes need not be identical, but 
only substantially similar to the product at hand.
    More specifically, in setting fees for the Intra-Day Volume 
Summary, the Exchange is constrained by the fact that, if its pricing 
is unattractive to subscribers, subscribers have their pick of an 
increasing number of alternative venues to use instead of the Exchange. 
The existence of numerous alternatives to the Exchange ensures that the 
Exchange cannot set unreasonable fees for historic market data without 
suffering the negative effects of that decision in the fiercely 
competitive market in which it operates.

B. Self-Regulatory Organization's Statement on Burden on Competition

    The Exchange does not believe that the proposed rule change will 
result in any burden on competition that is not necessary or 
appropriate in furtherance of the purposes of the Act. The Exchange 
also does not believe the proposed fees would cause any unnecessary or 
inappropriate burden on intermarket competition as other exchanges are 
free to introduce their own comparable historic data product and adopt 
fees to better compete with the Exchange's offering. Rather, the 
Exchange believes that the proposal will promote competition by 
permitting the Exchange to sell a data product similar to those offered 
by other competitor options exchanges.\26\ The Exchange is offering the 
Intra-Day Volume Summary in order to keep pace with changes in the 
industry and evolving customer needs, and believes the data product 
will contribute to robust competition among national securities 
exchanges. At least eight other U.S. options exchanges offer a market 
data product that is substantially similar to the Exchange's offering. 
As a result, the Exchange believes this proposed rule change permits 
fair competition among national securities exchanges.
---------------------------------------------------------------------------

    \26\ Id.
---------------------------------------------------------------------------

    Furthermore, the Exchange operates in a highly competitive 
environment, and its ability to price Intra-Day Volume Summary is 
constrained by competition among exchanges that offer similar data 
products to their customers. As discussed above, there are currently a 
number of similar products available to market participants and 
investors. At least eight other U.S. options exchanges offer a market 
data product that is substantially similar to the Exchange's offering, 
which the Exchange must consider in its pricing discipline in order to 
compete effectively.\27\ For example, proposing fees that are 
excessively higher than established fees for similar data products 
would simply serve to reduce demand for the Exchange's data product, 
which as discussed, market participants are under no obligation to 
utilize or purchase. In this competitive environment, potential 
purchasers are free to choose which, if any, similar product to 
purchase to satisfy their need for market information. As a result, the 
Exchange believes this proposed rule change permits fair competition 
among national securities exchanges.
---------------------------------------------------------------------------

    \27\ See supra note 12.
---------------------------------------------------------------------------

    The Exchange does not believe the proposed rule change would cause 
any unnecessary or inappropriate burden on intramarket competition. 
Particularly, the proposed fees would apply uniformly to any 
subscriber, in that the Exchange would not differentiate between 
subscribers that purchase the Intra-Day Volume Summary and all 
subscribers would receive the same information in the data feed. The 
Exchange believes the proposed fees are set at a modest level that 
would allow interested subscribers to purchase such data based on their 
business needs.

C. Self-Regulatory Organization's Statement on Comments on the Proposed 
Rule Change Received From Members, Participants, or Others

    No written comments were solicited or received with respect to the 
proposed rule change.

III. Date of Effectiveness of the Proposed Rule Change and Timing for 
Commission Action

    The foregoing rule change has become effective upon filing pursuant 
to Section 19(b)(3)(A) \28\ of the Act and paragraph (f) thereunder. At 
any time within 60 days of the filing of the proposed rule change, the 
Commission summarily may temporarily suspend such rule change if it 
appears to the Commission that such action is necessary or appropriate 
in the public interest, for the protection of investors, or otherwise 
in furtherance of the purposes of the Act.
