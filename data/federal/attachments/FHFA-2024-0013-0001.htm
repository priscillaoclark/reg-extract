I. Comments

    FHFA seeks public comments on the revision to the system of records 
and will take all comments into consideration. In addition to 
referencing ``Comments/No. 2024-N-9,'' please reference ``FHFA-14, 
Emergency Notification System.''
    FHFA will post all public comments on the FHFA public website at 
<a href="http://www.fhfa.gov">http://www.fhfa.gov</a>, except as described below. Commenters should 
submit only information that the commenter wishes to make available 
publicly. FHFA may post only a single representative example of 
identical or substantially identical comments, and in such cases will 
generally identify the number of identical or substantially identical 
comments represented by the posted example. FHFA may, in its 
discretion, redact or refrain from posting all or any portion of any 
comment that contains content that is obscene, vulgar, profane, or 
threatens harm. All comments, including those that are redacted or not 
posted, will be retained in their original form in FHFA's internal file 
and considered as required by all applicable laws. Commenters that 
would like FHFA to consider any portion of their comment exempt from 
disclosure on the basis that it contains trade secrets, or financial, 
confidential or proprietary data or information, should follow the 
procedures in section IV.D. of FHFA's Policy on Communications with 
Outside Parties in Connection with FHFA Rulemakings, see <a href="https://www.fhfa.gov/sites/default/files/documents/Ex-Parte-Communications-Public-Policy_3-5-19.pdf">https://www.fhfa.gov/sites/default/files/documents/Ex-Parte-Communications-Public-Policy_3-5-19.pdf</a>. FHFA cannot guarantee that such data or 
information, or the identity of the commenter, will remain confidential 
if disclosure is sought pursuant to an applicable statute or 
regulation. See 12 CFR 1202.8, 12 CFR 1214.2, and <a href="https://www.fhfa.gov/about/foia-reference-guide">https://www.fhfa.gov/about/foia-reference-guide</a> for additional information.

II. Introduction

    This notice informs the public of FHFA's proposed revision to an 
existing system of records. This notice satisfies the Privacy Act 
requirement that an agency publishes a system of records notice in the 
Federal Register when there is an addition or change to an agency's 
system of records. Congress has recognized that application of all 
requirements of the Privacy Act to certain categories of records may 
have an undesirable and often unacceptable effect upon agencies in the 
conduct of necessary public business. Consequently, Congress 
established general exemptions and specific exemptions that could be 
used to exempt records from provisions of the Privacy Act. Congress 
also required that exempting records from provisions of the Privacy Act 
would require the head of an agency to publish a determination to 
exempt a record from the Privacy Act as a rule in accordance with the 
Administrative Procedure Act. Records and information in this system of 
records are not exempt from the requirements of the Privacy Act.
    Pursuant to OMB Circular A-108, FHFA has not submitted a report 
describing the modified system of records covered by this notice to OMB

[[Page 61421]]

and Congress because the changes to the system are minor and 
administrative, and changes of this nature are not required to be 
reported.

III. Revised System of Records

    The revised system of records notice is set out in its entirety and 
described in detail below. The proposed modification to the System 
makes the following non-substantive changes:
    (1) Update the Agency's address to spell out the street name; and
    (2) Change the location of the system, in accordance with OMB 
Circular A-108.

SYSTEM NAME AND NUMBER:
    Emergency Notification System, FHFA-14.

SECURITY CLASSIFICATION:
    Sensitive but unclassified.

SYSTEM LOCATION:
    Federal Housing Finance Agency, 400 Seventh Street SW, Washington,

and 10995.

PURPOSE(S) OF THE SYSTEM:
    The purpose of this system of records is to maintain emergency 
contact information for current and former FHFA employees and 
contractor personnel. The system provides for high-speed message 
delivery that reaches all agency and contractor personnel in response 
to threat alerts issued by the Department of Homeland Security, weather 
related emergencies, or other critical situations that disrupt the 
operations of and accessibility to an FHFA worksite. The system also 
provides for personnel accountability during an emergency, through 
personnel sign-in and rapid alert and notification.

    Current and former FHFA employees and contractor personnel, and 
emergency contacts for these individuals.

CATEGORIES OF RECORDS IN THE SYSTEM:

mail addresses (personal and/or business), photographs, and geospatial 
and/or geological data.

personnel.

ROUTINE USES OF RECORDS MAINTAINED IN THE SYSTEM, INCLUDING CATEGORIES 
OF USERS AND PURPOSES OF SUCH USES:
    In addition to those disclosures generally permitted under 5 U.S.C. 
552a(b) of the Privacy Act, these records or information contained 
therein may specifically be disclosed outside FHFA as a routine use 
pursuant to 5 U.S.C. 552a(b)(3) as follows:
    (1) When (a) it is suspected or confirmed that the security or 
confidentiality of information in the system of records has been 
compromised; (b) FHFA has determined that as a result of the suspected 
or confirmed compromise there is a risk of harm to economic or property 
interests, identity theft or fraud, or harm to the security or 
integrity of this system or other systems or programs (whether 
maintained by FHFA or another agency or entity) that rely upon the 
compromised information; and (c) the disclosure is made to such 
agencies, entities, and persons who are reasonably necessary to assist 
in connection with FHFA's efforts to respond to the suspected or 
confirmed compromise and prevent, minimize, or remedy such harm.
    (2) Records in this system may be disclosed to any individual 
during the course of any inquiry or investigation conducted by FHFA, or 
in connection with civil or administrative litigation, if FHFA has 
reason to believe that the individual to whom the record is disclosed 
may have further information about the matters related therein, and 
those matters appeared to be relevant at the time to the subject matter 
of the inquiry.
    (3) A record or information in the system may be disclosed to any 
individual with whom FHFA contracts to reproduce, by typing, photocopy 
or other means, any record within this system for use by FHFA and its 
employees in connection with their official duties or to any individual 
who is utilized by FHFA to perform clerical or stenographic functions 
relating to the official business of FHFA.
    (4) To appropriate federal, state, and local authorities 
responsible for investigating or prosecuting a violation of, or for 
enforcing or implementing a statute, rule, regulation, or order issued, 
when the information indicates a violation or potential violation of 
law, whether civil, criminal, or regulatory in nature, and whether 
arising by general statute or particular program statute, or by 
regulation, rule, or order issued pursuant thereto.
    (5) To a court, magistrate, or other administrative body in the 
course of presenting evidence, including disclosures to counsel or 
witnesses in the course of civil discovery, litigation, or settlement 
negotiations or in connection with criminal proceedings, when FHFA is a 
party to the proceeding or has a significant interest in the 
proceeding, to the extent that the information is determined to be 
relevant and necessary.
    (6) To a Congressional office from the record of an individual in 
response to an inquiry from the Congressional office made at the 
request of that individual.
    (7) To contractor personnel, interns, and others performing or 
working on a contract, service, grant, cooperative agreement, or 
project for FHFA.
    (8) To any Federal government authority for the purpose of 
coordinating with or reviewing FHFA's continuity of operations plans or 
emergency contingency plans.
    (9) To any Federal, State or Local government authority for the 
purpose of coordinating a response to threat alerts issued by the 
Department of Homeland Security, weather related emergencies, or other 
critical situations that disrupt the operations of and accessibility to 
an FHFA worksite.
    (10) To the National Archives and Records Administration, Office of 
Government Information Services (OGIS), to the extent necessary to 
fulfill its responsibilities in 5 U.S.C. 552(b), to review 
administrative agency policies, procedures and compliance with the 
Freedom of Information Act (FOIA), and to facilitate OGIS' offering of 
mediation services to resolve disputes between persons making FOIA
