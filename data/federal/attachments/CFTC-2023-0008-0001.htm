SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION:
    Title: Registration under the Commodity Exchange Act (OMB Control 
No. 3038-0023). This is a request for an extension of a currently 
approved information collection.
    Abstract: The information collected under OMB Control No. 3038-0023 
is gathered through the use of forms for registration of firms and 
individuals who are required by the Commodity Exchange Act (``CEA'') to 
register with the Commission. The CEA requires commodity interest 
market intermediaries and participants to register, including: Futures 
commission merchants and introducing brokers (7 U.S.C. 6d); Commodity 
pool operators and commodity trading advisors (7 U.S.C. 6m(1)); Retail 
foreign exchange dealers (7 U.S.C. 2(c)); Associated persons (7 U.S.C. 
6k); Floor traders or floor brokers (7 U.S.C. 6e); and Swap dealers and 
major swap participants (7 U.S.C. 6s(a)). The CFTC uses various forms 
for registration (and withdrawal therefrom) (the ``Registration 
Forms''). OMB Control No. 3038-0023 applies to the Registration Forms 
for registration of persons other than swap dealers and major swap 
participants.\2\
---------------------------------------------------------------------------

    \2\ Forms for registration of swap dealers and major swap 
participants are the subject of a separate information collection 
(OMB Control Number 3038-0072).
---------------------------------------------------------------------------

    An agency may not conduct or sponsor, and a person is not required 
to respond to, a collection of information unless it displays a 
currently valid OMB control number. On October 18, 2022, the Commission 
published in the Federal Register notice of the proposed extension of 
this information collection and provided 60 days for public comment on 
the proposed extension, 87 FR 63051 (``60-Day Notice''). The

[[Page 3722]]

Commission did not receive any relevant comments on the 60-Day Notice.
    Burden Statement: The Commission is revising its burden estimate 
for this collection to reflect its estimate of the current number of 
CFTC registrants subject to the requirements of Part 162 regulations. 
The respondent burden for this collection is estimated to be as 
follows:
    Estimated Number of Respondents: 78,055.
    Estimated Total Annual Burden Hours: 7,852 hours.
    Frequency of Collection: Periodically.
    There are no capital costs or operating and maintenance costs 
associated with this collection.

(Authority: 44 U.S.C. 3501 et seq.)

    Dated: January 17, 2023.
Robert Sidman,
Deputy Secretary of the Commission.
