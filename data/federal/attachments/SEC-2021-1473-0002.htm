SECURITIES AND EXCHANGE COMMISSION

[SEC File No. 270-451, OMB Control No. 3235-0763]


Proposed Collection; Comment Request; Extension: Rule 304 of 
Regulation ATS

Upon Written Request, Copies Available From: Securities and Exchange 
Commission, Office of FOIA Services, 100 F Street NE, Washington, DC 
20549-2736

    Notice is hereby given that pursuant to the Paperwork Reduction Act 
of 1995 (``PRA'') (44 U.S.C. 3501 et seq.), the Securities and Exchange 
Commission (``Commission'') is soliciting comments on the existing 
collection of information provided for in Rule 304 of Regulation ATS 
(17 CFR 242.304) and Form ATS-N under the Securities Exchange Act of 
1934 (15 U.S.C. 78a et seq.) (``Exchange Act''). The Commission plans 
to submit this existing collection of information to the Office of 
Management and Budget (``OMB'') for extension and approval.
    Regulation ATS provides a regulatory structure for alternative 
trading systems. Rule 304 of Regulation ATS provides conditions for NMS 
Stock ATSs seeking to rely on the exemption from the definition of 
``exchange'' provided by Rule 3a1-1(a) of the Exchange Act, including 
to file a Form ATS-N, and for that Form ATS-N to become effective. Form 
ATS-N requires NMS Stock ATSs to provide information about their manner 
of operations, the broker-dealer operator, and the ATS-related 
activities of the broker-dealer operator and its affiliates to comply 
with the conditions provided under Rule 304. Form ATS-N promotes more 
efficient and effective market operations by providing more 
transparency to market participants about the operations of NMS Stock 
ATSs and the potential conflicts of interest of the controlling broker-
dealer operator and its affiliates, and helps brokers meet their best 
execution obligations to their customers. Operational transparency 
rules, including Form ATS-N, are designed to increase competition among 
trading centers in regard to order routing and execution quality.
    The Commission staff estimates that entities subject to the 
requirements of Rule 304 and Form ATS-N will spend a total of 
approximately 1,901 hours a year to comply with the Rule.
    Written comments are invited on: (a) whether the proposed 
collection of information is necessary for the proper performance of 
the functions of the Commission, including whether the information 
shall have practical utility; (b) the accuracy of the Commission's 
estimates of the burden of the proposed collection of information; (c) 
ways to enhance the quality, utility, and clarity of the information 
collected; and (d) ways to minimize the burden of the collection of 
information on respondents, including through the use of automated 
collection techniques or other forms of information technology. 
Consideration will be given to comments and suggestions submitted by 
January 31, 2025. An agency may not conduct or sponsor, and a person is 
not required to respond to, a collection of information under the PRA 
unless it displays a currently valid OMB control number.
    Please direct your written comments to: Austin Gerig, Director/
Chief Data Officer, Securities and Exchange Commission, c/o Tanya 
Ruttenberg, 100 F Street NE, Washington, DC 20549, or send an email to:

    Dated: November 25, 2024.
Vanessa A. Countryman,
Secretary.
