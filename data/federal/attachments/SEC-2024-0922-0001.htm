date of publication of the Notice of filing of the proposed rule

approving or disapproving the proposed rule change, however, by not 
more than 60 days if the Commission determines that a longer period is

proposed rule change was published for comment in the Federal Register 
on January 17, 2024.\10\ The 180th day after publication of the Notice
