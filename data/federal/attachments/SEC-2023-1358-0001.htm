I. Summary of the Proposal

    As described in more detail in the Notice,\7\ the Exchange proposes 
to list and trade the Shares of the Trust under BZX Rule 14.11(e)(4), 
which governs the listing and trading of Commodity-Based Trust Shares 
on the Exchange.
---------------------------------------------------------------------------

    \7\ See Notice, supra note 3.
---------------------------------------------------------------------------

    The investment objective of the Trust is to reflect the performance 
of the price of bitcoin less the expenses of the

[[Page 82440]]

Trust's operations.\8\ The Trust's assets will consist of bitcoin held 
by the Trust's custodian on behalf of the Trust.\9\ The Trust will 
value its Shares daily based on the value of bitcoin as reflected by 
the CoinDesk Bitcoin Price Index (XBX) (``Index'').\10\ The 
administrator of the Trust will determine the net asset value (``NAV'') 
of the Trust on each day that the Exchange is open for regular trading, 
as soon as practicable after 4:00 p.m. ET.\11\ In determining the 
Trust's NAV, the administrator will calculate the price of the bitcoin 
held by the Trust as reflected by the Index as of 4:00 p.m. ET.\12\ 
When the Trust sells or redeems its Shares, it will do so in ``in-
kind'' transactions with authorized participants in large blocks of 
Shares.\13\
---------------------------------------------------------------------------

    \8\ See id. at 57499. Global X Digital Assets (``Sponsor'') is 
the sponsor of the Trust. See id. at 57490.
    \9\ See id. at 57499. The Trust generally does not intend to 
hold cash or cash equivalents; however, there may be situations 
where the Trust would unexpectedly hold cash or cash equivalents on 
a temporary basis. See id.
    \10\ See id.

---------------------------------------------------------------------------

II. Proceedings To Determine Whether To Approve or Disapprove SR-
CboeBZX-2023-058 and Grounds for Disapproval Under Consideration

    The Commission is instituting proceedings pursuant to Section 
19(b)(2)(B) of the Act \14\ to determine whether the proposed rule 
change should be approved or disapproved. Institution of proceedings is 
appropriate at this time in view of the legal and policy issues raised 
by the proposed rule change, as discussed below. Institution of 
proceedings does not indicate that the Commission has reached any 
conclusions with respect to any of the issues involved. Rather, as 
described below, the Commission seeks and encourages interested persons 
to provide comments on the proposed rule change.
---------------------------------------------------------------------------

    \14\ 15 U.S.C. 78s(b)(2)(B).
---------------------------------------------------------------------------

    Pursuant to Section 19(b)(2)(B) of the Act,\15\ the Commission is 
providing notice of the grounds for disapproval under consideration. 
The Commission is instituting proceedings to allow for additional 
analysis of the proposed rule change's consistency with Section 6(b)(5) 
of the Act, which requires, among other things, that the rules of a 
national securities exchange be ``designed to prevent fraudulent and 
manipulative acts and practices'' and ``to protect investors and the 
public interest.'' \16\
---------------------------------------------------------------------------

    \15\ Id.
    \16\ 15 U.S.C. 78f(b)(5).
---------------------------------------------------------------------------

    The Commission asks that commenters address the sufficiency of the 
Exchange's statements in support of the proposal, which are set forth 
in the Notice, in addition to any other comments they may wish to 
submit about the proposed rule change. In particular, the Commission 
seeks comment on the following questions and asks commenters to submit 
data where appropriate to support their views:
    1. What are commenters' views on whether the proposed Trust and 
Shares would be susceptible to manipulation? What are commenters' views 
generally on whether the Exchange's proposal is designed to prevent 
fraudulent and manipulative acts and practices? What are commenters' 
views generally with respect to the liquidity and transparency of the 
bitcoin markets and the bitcoin markets' susceptibility to 
manipulation?
    2. Based on data and analysis provided and the academic research 
cited by the Exchange,\17\ do commenters agree with the Exchange that 
the Chicago Mercantile Exchange (``CME''), on which CME bitcoin futures 
trade, represents a regulated market of significant size related to 
spot bitcoin? \18\ What are commenters' views on whether there is a 
reasonable likelihood that a person attempting to manipulate the Shares 
would also have to trade on the CME to manipulate the Shares? \19\ Do 
commenters agree with the Exchange that trading in the Shares would not 
be the predominant influence on prices in the CME bitcoin futures 
market? \20\
---------------------------------------------------------------------------

    \17\ See Notice, 88 FR at 57495-98.
    \18\ See id. at 57491.
    \19\ See id. at 57498.
    \20\ See id.
---------------------------------------------------------------------------

    3. The Exchange states that bitcoin is resistant to price 
manipulation and that other means to prevent fraudulent and 
manipulative acts and practices ``exist to justify dispensing with the 
requisite surveillance sharing agreement'' with a regulated market of 
significant size related to spot bitcoin.\21\ In support, the Exchange 
states, among other things, that the geographically diverse and 
continuous nature of bitcoin trading make it difficult and 
prohibitively costly to manipulate the price of bitcoin, and that the 
fragmentation across bitcoin platforms, the relatively slow speed of 
transactions, and the capital necessary to maintain a significant 
presence on each trading platform make manipulation of bitcoin prices 
through continuous trading activity challenging.\22\ The Exchange also 
states that offering only in-kind creations and redemptions provides 
``unique protections against potential attempts to manipulate the price 
of the Shares'' and that the price the Sponsor uses to value the 
Trust's bitcoin ``is not particularly important.'' \23\ Do commenters 
agree with the Exchange's statements regarding the bitcoin market's 
resistance to price manipulation?
---------------------------------------------------------------------------

    \21\ See id. at 57497 n.49.
    \22\ See id.
    \23\ See id. at 57498.
---------------------------------------------------------------------------

    4. The Exchange also states that it will execute a surveillance-
sharing agreement with Coinbase, Inc. (``Coinbase'') that is intended 
to supplement the Exchange's market surveillance program.\24\ According 
to the Exchange, the agreement is ``expected to have the hallmarks of a 
surveillance-sharing agreement between two members of the [Intermarket 
Surveillance Group], which would give the Exchange supplemental access 
to data regarding spot [b]itcoin trades on Coinbase where the Exchange 
determines it is necessary as part of its surveillance program for the 
Commodity-Based Trust Shares.'' \25\ Based on the description of the 
surveillance-sharing agreement as provided by the Exchange, what are 
commenters' views of such an agreement if finalized and executed? Do 
commenters agree with the Exchange that such an agreement with Coinbase 
would be ``helpful in detecting, investigating, and deterring fraud and 
market manipulation in the Commodity-Based Trust Shares''? \26\
---------------------------------------------------------------------------

    \24\ See id.
    \25\ See id. The Exchange states that ``[t]his means that the 
Exchange expects to receive market data for orders and trades from 
Coinbase, which it will utilize in surveillance of the trading of 
Commodity-Based Trust Shares.'' Id.
    \26\ See id.
---------------------------------------------------------------------------

    5. Some sponsors of proposed spot bitcoin exchange-traded products 
have also provided data regarding the correlation between certain 
bitcoin spot markets and the CME bitcoin futures market.\27\ What are 
commenters' views on the correlation between the bitcoin spot market 
and the CME bitcoin futures

[[Page 82441]]

market? What are commenters' views on the extent to which that 
correlation provides evidence that the CME bitcoin futures market is 
``significant'' related to spot bitcoin?
---------------------------------------------------------------------------

    \27\ See, e.g., Notice of Filing of Amendment No. 3 to, and 
Order Instituting Proceedings to Determine Whether to Approve or 
Disapprove, a Proposed Rule Change to List and Trade Shares of the 
ARK 21Shares Bitcoin ETF under BZX Rule 14.11(e)(4), Commodity-Based 
Trust Shares, Securities Exchange Act Release No. 98112 (Aug. 11, 
2023), 88 FR 55743 (Aug. 16, 2023) (including data from sponsor 
21Shares US LLC that purports to show correlations of returns across 
the two-year period from January 20, 2021, to February 1, 2023, of 
no less than 92% among certain spot bitcoin platforms and between 
the CME bitcoin futures market and such spot bitcoin platforms on an 
hourly basis, and no less than 78% on a minutely basis).
---------------------------------------------------------------------------

III. Procedure: Request for Written Comments

    The Commission requests that interested persons provide written 
submissions of their views, data, and arguments with respect to the 
issues identified above, as well as any other concerns they may have 
with the proposal. In particular, the Commission invites the written 
views of interested persons concerning whether the proposal is 
consistent with Section 6(b)(5) or any other provision of the Act, and 
the rules and regulations thereunder. Although there do not appear to 
be any issues relevant to approval or disapproval that would be 
facilitated by an oral presentation of views, data, and arguments, the 
Commission will consider, pursuant to Rule 19b-4, any request for an 
opportunity to make an oral presentation.\28\
---------------------------------------------------------------------------

    \28\ Section 19(b)(2) of the Act, as amended by the Securities 
Acts Amendments of 1975, Public Law 94-29 (June 4, 1975), grants the 
Commission flexibility to determine what type of proceeding--either 
oral or notice and opportunity for written comments--is appropriate 
for consideration of a particular proposal by a self-regulatory 
organization. See Securities Acts Amendments of 1975, Senate Comm. 
on Banking, Housing & Urban Affairs, S. Rep. No. 75, 94th Cong., 1st 
Sess. 30 (1975).

arguments regarding whether the proposed rule change should be approved 
or disapproved by December 15, 2023. Any person who wishes to file a
