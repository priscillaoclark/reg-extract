proposed information collection, as required by the Paperwork Reduction 
Act of 1995. EXIM Bank has an electronic disbursement approval 
processing system for guaranteed lenders with transactions documented 
under Medium-Term Master Guarantee Agreements. After an export 
transaction has been authorized by EXIM Bank and legal documentation 
has been completed, the lender will obtain and review the required 
disbursement documents (e.g., invoices, bills of lading, Exporter's 
Certificate, etc.) and will disburse the proceeds of the loan for 
eligible goods and services. In order to obtain approval of the 
disbursement, the lender will access and complete an electronic 
questionnaire through EXIM Bank's online application system (EXIM 
Online). Using the form, the lender will input key data and request 
EXIM Bank's approval of the disbursement. EXIM Bank's action (approved 
or denied) is posted on the lender's history page. The information 
collected in the questionnaire will assist EXIM Bank in determining 
that each disbursement under a Medium-Term Guarantee meets all the 
terms and conditions for approval. The information collection tool can 
be reviewed at: <a href="http://exim.gov/sites/default/files/pub/pending/eib12-01.pdf">http://exim.gov/sites/default/files/pub/pending/eib12-01.pdf</a>.
