Joint Industry Plan; Notice of Filing of Partial Amendment No. 1 
to an Amendment to the National Market System Plan Governing the 
Consolidated Audit Trail Regarding Cost Savings Measures

October 1, 2024.
    On March 27, 2024, and pursuant to Section 11A(a)(3) of the 
Securities Exchange Act of 1934 (the ``Exchange Act'') \1\ and Rule 608 
of Regulation NMS thereunder,\2\ BOX Exchange LLC, Cboe BYX Exchange,

---------------------------------------------------------------------------

I. Revisions to the Proposed Cost Savings Amendments

    CAT LLC was both surprised and disappointed by the Commission's 
decision to institute proceedings on the Proposed Cost Savings 
Amendments, which will delay or ultimately impede CAT LLC's ability to 
achieve more than $20 million in annual cost savings. All commenters 
strongly favored the Proposed Cost Savings Amendments.\9\ The 
Commission did not receive any comments opposing the proposed 
amendments.
---------------------------------------------------------------------------

    \9\ See Letter from Howard Meyerson, Managing Director, FIF, to 
Commission (May 7, 2024); Letter from Ellen Greene, Managing 
Director, Equities & Options Market Structure, and Joseph Corcoran, 
Managing Director, Associate General Counsel, SIFMA, to Vanessa 
Countryman, Secretary, Commission (May 31, 2024); Letter from 
Jeffrey S. Davis, Senior Vice President, Principal Deputy General 
Counsel, Nasdaq, Inc., to Vanessa Countryman, Secretary, Commission 
(July 1, 2024).
---------------------------------------------------------------------------

    While the Commission does not bear any CAT costs, the Commission's 
objective should be to ensure the CAT achieves its regulatory 
objectives in an efficient and cost-effective manner. The immense costs 
of operating the CAT--estimated at $213 million in 2024--are driven by 
the strict requirements in the CAT NMS Plan to process and store record 
data volumes in accordance with complex reporting and linkage 
requirements, within the narrow timeframes required by the SEC. CAT LLC 
and the Plan Processor have put significant effort into reducing CAT 
costs that are within their control given these strict requirements, 
but many additional cost savings measures require Commission action to 
permit their implementation.
    After discussions with the Staff, CAT LLC is withdrawing the 
proposal to provide an interim CAT-Order-ID on an ``as requested'' 
basis, as opposed to on a continuous basis, which would have resulted 
in approximately $2 million in annual cost savings. With these changes, 
CAT LLC strongly urges the Commission to approve the Proposed Cost 
Savings Amendments without further delay.

A. Processing, Storage, and Query Requirements for Options Market Maker 
Quotes in Listed Options

    The CAT NMS Plan currently contains broad requirements relating to 
the processing, storage, and querying of Option Market Maker quotes in 
Listed Options.\10\ The Proposed Cost Savings Amendments would save 
approximately $20 million annually by changing certain processing, 
query, and storage requirements that would otherwise apply to Options 
Market Maker quotes in Listed Options.\11\ These changes would 
significantly reduce the costs of the CAT with limited regulatory 
impact. The vast majority of Options Market Maker quote lifecycles do 
not involve any execution or allocation and Participant regulatory 
users very rarely access such data. Options Exchanges would continue to 
report Options Market Maker quotes in Listed Options in the same manner 
they do today, but the Plan Processor would only ingest, perform basic 
data validations, and store such data. Unlinked data would remain 
accessible to regulators by T+1 at 12:00 p.m. Eastern Time.
---------------------------------------------------------------------------

    \10\ For a description of these requirements, see OIP at 58839-
40.
    \11\ As described in the SRO Letter, only market maker quotes 
that are reported to CAT as quote events would be affected by the 
proposal. Market maker quotes reported to CAT as order events will 
not be impacted by this proposal and will continue to receive all 
enrichments and be fully available to regulatory users in DIVER. See 
SRO Letter at 7.
---------------------------------------------------------------------------

    Based on discussions with the Staff, CAT LLC is proposing several 
revisions to the Proposed Cost Savings Amendments.
    First, CAT LLC proposes to revise the Proposed Cost Savings 
Amendments to replace any proposed references to ``Options Market Maker 
Quotes in Listed Options,'' which is not a separately defined term in 
the CAT NMS Plan, with ``Options Market Maker quotes in Listed 
Options''.\12\ Relatedly, to eliminate potential confusion regarding 
the intended scope of the proposal, CAT LLC proposes to eliminate the 
phrase ``and related Reportable Events''. CAT LLC believes that the 
meaning of Options Market Maker quotes in Listed Options is well 
understood by CAT Reporters as it has been the basis for CAT reporting 
since the inception of the CAT.\13\ Specifically, as described in 
Section 5.1 (Market Maker Quotes) of the Plan Participant Technical 
Specifications, there are two types of events used to report Options 
Market Maker quotes in Listed Options:
---------------------------------------------------------------------------

    \12\ An ``Options Market Maker'' is ``a broker-dealer registered 
with an exchange for the purpose of making markets in options 
contracts on the exchange.'' Section 1.1 of the CAT NMS Plan. A 
``Listed Option'' is defined as having ``the meaning set forth in 
Rule 600(b)(35) of Regulation NMS.'' See id. Rule 600(b)(35) has 
since been redesignated as Rule 600(b)(43), which defines a ``Listed 
Option'' as ``any option traded on a registered national securities 
exchange or automated facility of a national securities 
association.'' 17 CFR 242.600(b)(43).
    \13\ See Section 6.4(d)(iii) of the CAT NMS Plan (describing 
``the reporting obligations of an Options Market Maker with regard 
to its quotes in Listed Options''). See also CAT Alert 2020-03, 
Options Market Maker Quote Sent Time (June 4, 2020).
---------------------------------------------------------------------------

    <bullet> Quote Event: Used to report a new quote or a quote 
replacement. When a quote is replaced, the Original Quote ID will 
identify the quote being replaced, and the Quote ID will provide the 
new ID for the updated and replaced quote (or note in the event that 
the market maker can only have one quote active at any given time).
    <bullet> Quote Cancel: Reported when a quote is canceled.\14\
---------------------------------------------------------------------------

    \14\ See Section 5.1 of the CAT Reporting Technical 
Specifications for Plan Participant v. 10r.21 [sic] (Apr. 15, 2024), 
<a href="https://www.catnmsplan.com/sites/default/files/2024-04/04.15.2024-CAT_Reporting_Technical_Specifications_for_Participants_4.1.0-r21.pdf">https://www.catnmsplan.com/sites/default/files/2024-04/04.15.2024-CAT_Reporting_Technical_Specifications_for_Participants_4.1.0-r21.pdf</a>.
---------------------------------------------------------------------------

    Accordingly, under the proposed amendments, Option Quote (OQ) and 
Option Quote Cancel (OQC) events will not be subject to any requirement 
to link and create an order lifecycle, and will not undergo any linkage 
validation, linkage feedback, or lifecycle enrichment processing.
    Relatedly, trades resulting from an Options Market Maker quote are 
reported to the CAT by Plan Participants using Option Trade (OT) 
events. OT events will continue to be subject to the requirement to 
link and create an order lifecycle, and will undergo linkage 
validation, linkage feedback, and lifecycle enrichment processing. 
However, given the proposal to eliminate linkage requirements related 
to OQ and OQC events, when an Options Market Maker quote is on one side 
of an OT event, the quote side of the OT event will not be linked to 
the Options Market Maker quote via the linkage process; instead, a 
single event lifecycle will be created that contains only the quote 
side of the OT event. Regulators, however, will be able to readily 
identify the Options Market Maker quote executed in an OT event via the 
quoteID field on the side of the OT event involving the Options Market 
Maker quote. In addition, the side of the OT event that does not 
involve an Options Market Maker quote would be linked with the relevant 
order and would include the order lifecycle related to such order, and 
would be subject to all lifecycle enrichment processing.
    Second, CAT LLC proposes to revise the Proposed Cost Savings 
Amendments to clarify that the Plan Processor would continue to perform 
ingestion validation on Options Market Maker quotes (but would stop 
performing linkage validation).\15\
---------------------------------------------------------------------------

    \15\ For reference, see Appendix B-1 (describing data ingestion 
error codes) and Appendix B-3 (describing linkage validation error 
codes) of the CAT Reporting Technical Specifications for Plan 
Participant v.10r.21 [sic] (Apr. 15, 2024).
---------------------------------------------------------------------------

    Third, CAT LLC proposes to revise the Proposed Cost Savings 
Amendments to provide that, upon request of the SEC or any Participant, 
the Plan Processor will provide the business and technical requirements 
needed to re-create the eliminated enrichments, as well as the code 
required to derive any eliminated data elements from the unlinked data.
    As revised, new Section 3.4 of Appendix D would state:

3.4 Requirements for Options Market Maker Quotes in Listed Options

    The provisions of this section shall govern the processing and 
storage of Options Market Maker quotes in Listed Options and shall 
override any conflicting provisions in the CAT NMS Plan, this 
Appendix D, or Exchange Act Rule 17a-1.
    Options Market Maker quotes in Listed Options must be reported 
to the Central Repository as provided under Section 6.4(d)(iii) of 
the CAT NMS Plan. This data will undergo ingestion validation only 
and such unlinked data will be made available to regulators by T+1 
at 12:00 p.m. Eastern Time. Options Market Maker quotes in Listed 
Options will not be subject to any requirement to link and create an 
order lifecycle, and will not undergo any linkage validation, 
linkage feedback, or lifecycle enrichment processing, but will 
undergo ingestion validation. Options Market Maker quotes in Listed 
Options will be accessible through BDSQL and Direct Read interfaces 
only and will not be accessible through the online targeted query 
tool.
    Upon request of the SEC or any Participant, the Plan Processor 
will provide the business and technical requirements needed to re-
create the eliminated enrichments, as well as the code (which is 
unique to the Plan Processor's linkage implementation) existing as 
of the effective date of this provision used to derive the 
eliminated enrichments. The Plan Processor will not maintain the 
business and technical requirements and the code following the 
effective date of this provision, but it will retain a copy so that 
they may be provided to any regulators that might request them in 
the future.

    In addition, as noted in the Proposed Cost Savings Amendments, CAT 
LLC proposes to amend Section 3, Section 6.1, and Section 8.1.1 of 
Appendix D of the CAT NMS Plan to include cross-references to new 
Section 3.4 of Appendix D. Consistent with the revisions discussed 
above, references to ``Options Market Maker Quotes in Listed Options 
and related Reportable Events'' in Section 3, Section 6.1, and

[[Page 81122]]

Section 8.1.1 of Appendix D have been revised to ``Options Market Maker 
quotes in Listed Options''.

B. Storage for Raw Unprocessed Data and Interim Operational Copies of 
CAT Data Older Than 15 Days

    The CAT NMS Plan currently requires CAT Data to be ``directly 
available and searchable electronically without manual intervention for 
at least six years'' and within certain query tool response times.\16\ 
The Proposed Cost Savings Amendments would save approximately $1 
million annually by permitting the Plan Processor to move raw 
unprocessed data (i.e., as-submitted data) and interim operational data 
older than 15 days to a more cost-effective storage tier that is 
optimized for infrequent access. In each case, retrieving such data for 
regulators would require some ``manual intervention'' by the Plan 
Processor.
---------------------------------------------------------------------------

    \16\ See Section 6.5(b)(i) and Appendix D, Section 1.4 of the 
CAT NMS Plan.
---------------------------------------------------------------------------

    As described in the Proposed Cost Savings Amendments, when a 
regulator queries CAT data, the CAT always provides results to the user 
based on the latest, most current version of the data. Accordingly, raw 
unprocessed data and interim operational data older than 15 days do not 
provide any regulatory value after the final corrected data version is 
delivered by T+5 at 8:00 a.m. ET.
    Based on discussions with the Staff, CAT LLC proposes to amend the 
Proposed Cost Savings Amendments to clarify the scope of affected 
data.\17\ In addition, CAT LLC proposes to clarify that the Plan 
Processor will restore archived data to an accessible storage tier upon 
request to the CAT Help Desk by an authorized regulatory user from the 
Participants or a senior officer from the SEC.\18\ Finally, CAT LLC 
proposes to clarify that ``Interim Operational Data'' does not include 
processed data relating to Options Market Maker quotes in Listed 
Options made available to regulators by T+1 at 12:00 p.m. ET. As 
revised, new Section 6.3 of Appendix D would state:
---------------------------------------------------------------------------

    \17\ Exhibit A of the Proposed Cost Savings Amendments 
previously referred to ``interim raw unprocessed data''; the text of 
Exhibit A has been clarified to refer to ``raw unprocessed data''.
    \18\ CAT Data is currently stored in three storage tiers: S3 
Frequent Access, S3 Infrequent Access, and S3 Instant Archive 
Access. Data files that are either new or that have recently been 
read by regulatory users are stored in S3 Frequent Access. If a file 
is not read by a regulatory user for 30 days, then it moves to S3 
Infrequent Access. Similarly, if a file is not read by a regulatory 
user for 90 days, then it moves to S3 Archive Instant Access. The 
Plan Processor currently anticipates that archived data would be 
restored to the S3 Frequent Access tier. Storage tiers are subject 
to change based on future technology developments and product 
offerings.
---------------------------------------------------------------------------

6.3 Exceptions to Data Availability Requirements

    Notwithstanding any other provision of the CAT NMS Plan, this 
Appendix D, or Exchange Act Rule 17a-1, the following types of data 
may be retained in an archive storage tier. Archived data is not 
directly available and searchable electronically without manual 
intervention and will not be subject to any query tool performance 
requirements until it is restored to an accessible storage tier. The 
Plan Processor will restore archived data to an accessible storage 
tier upon request to the CAT Help Desk by an authorized regulatory 
user from the Participants or a senior officer from the SEC.
    <bullet> Raw Unprocessed Data older than 15 days. ``Raw 
Unprocessed Data'' means data that has been ingested by the Plan 
Processor and made available to regulators prior to 12:00 p.m. 
Eastern Time on T+1.
    <bullet> Interim Operational Data older than 15 days. ``Interim 
Operational Data'' means all processed, validated and unlinked data 
made available to regulators by T+1 at 12:00 p.m. ET and all 
iterations of processed data made available to regulators between 
T+1 and T+5, but excludes the final version of corrected data that 
is made available at T+5 at 8:00 a.m. ET. For the avoidance of 
doubt, ``Interim Operational Data'' does not include processed data 
relating to Options Market Maker quotes in Listed Options made 
available to regulators by T+1 at 12:00 p.m. ET.
    <bullet> All submission and feedback files older than 15 days.

    In addition, as noted in Exhibit A of the Proposed Cost Savings 
Amendments, CAT LLC proposes to add the phrase ``subject to the 
exceptions in Section 6.3 of Appendix D'' to Section 6.5(b)(i) \19\ and 
Section 1.4 of Appendix D.
---------------------------------------------------------------------------

    \19\ The Proposed Cost Savings Amendments inadvertently referred 
to Section 6.5(d)(i); however, Exhibit A of the Proposed Cost 
Savings Amendments accurately reflected the addition of the phrase 
``subject to the exceptions in Section 6.3 of Appendix D'' to 
Section 6.5(b)(i) as intended.
---------------------------------------------------------------------------

C. Provision of an Interim CAT-Order-ID on an ``As Requested'' Basis

    The CAT NMS Plan currently requires the Plan Processor to provide 
an interim CAT- Order-ID by T+1 at 9 p.m. ET, even where no regulatory 
need exists.\20\ With respect to this requirement, the Commission has 
previously invited the Participants ``to develop alternative solutions 
that achieve the regulatory goals of Rule 613 and the CAT NMS Plan in a 
more cost- effective manner,'' noting that ``the Commission emphasizes 
its willingness to consider such alternative solutions in the form of a 
proposed CAT NMS Plan amendment.'' \21\
---------------------------------------------------------------------------

    \20\ See Exchange Act Release No. 98848 (Nov. 2, 2023), 88 FR 
77128 (Nov. 8, 2023) (granting exemptive relief from the requirement 
set forth in appendix D, section 6.1 of the CAT NMS Plan that 
lifecycle linkages be created by T+1 at noon ET).
    \21\ Exchange Act Release No. 95234 (July 8, 2022), 87 FR 42247, 
42248 (July 14, 2022).
---------------------------------------------------------------------------

    CAT LLC originally proposed to provide an interim CAT-Order-ID on 
an ``as requested'' basis, which would have saved approximately $2 
million annually. This alternative solution would have preserved the 
Commission's ability to obtain an interim CAT-Order-ID promptly upon 
request, while avoiding the substantial cost of delivering an interim 
CAT-Order-ID on a regular ongoing basis even where no regulatory need 
exists. CAT LLC would have added a separate line item to its budget to 
reflect costs attributable to SEC requests to generate an interim CAT-
Order-ID.
    However, after discussions with the Staff, CAT LLC is withdrawing 
this proposal. Accordingly, the prior changes to Section 6.1 of 
Appendix D relating to this proposal have been eliminated. The 
Participants continue to believe that the approximate $2 million in 
annual savings associated with the proposal substantially outweigh the 
minimal regulatory impact. Subject to further discussions with the 
Staff, the Participants will consider whether to re-propose this 
proposal in a future cost savings amendment.

II. Additional Details Regarding Calculation of $21 Million in 
Estimated Annual Savings

    The Commission requested ``additional details and underlying 
calculations used to estimate the cost savings as well as information 
on the costs to the Plan Processor of implementing each element of each 
of the proposed amendments (e.g., some amendments would require coding 
changes, which would impose costs).'' \22\
---------------------------------------------------------------------------

    \22\ OIP at 58847.
---------------------------------------------------------------------------

    The Proposed Cost Savings Amendments and the SRO Letter include 
detailed information regarding how the cost savings estimates were 
calculated, which CAT LLC is further supplementing below. As previously 
described, all cost savings estimates are based on reasonable 
assumptions related to, among other factors, the current state and 
costs of CAT operations; current CAT NMS Plan requirements; reporting 
by Participants, Industry Members and market data providers; observed 
data rates and volumes; current discounts, reservations, and cost 
savings plans; and associated cloud fees.\23\ CAT LLC

[[Page 81123]]

believes that the cost savings estimates and assumptions are reasonable 
and provide an adequate basis for the Commission to evaluate the costs 
and benefits of the Cost Savings Amendments.
---------------------------------------------------------------------------

    \23\ See Proposed Cost Savings Amendments at 2 n.5.
---------------------------------------------------------------------------

    One-time implementation costs are expected to be minimal relative 
to overall cost savings. Implementation costs may vary based on various 
factors, including the details of any requirements in any final 
amendment approved by the Commission and any changes in labor costs. 
One-time implementation costs will generally consist of Plan Processor 
labor costs associated with coding and software development, as well as 
any related cloud fees associated with the development, testing and 
load testing of the proposed changes. Ongoing operational costs, other 
than cloud hosting costs, will not be affected by the proposed 
amendments.

1. Processing, Storage, and Query Requirements for Options Market Maker 
Quotes in Listed Options: Estimated Annual Savings of $20 Million

    The Proposed Cost Savings Amendments would save approximately $20 
million annually by changing certain processing, query, and storage 
requirements that would otherwise apply to Options Market Maker quotes 
in Listed Options.
    Processing Requirements. The Plan Processor estimates that 
approximately $12 million in savings would be attributable to linkage 
processing and data processing reductions, assuming 22 processing days 
per month for a total of 264 processing days in a year and based on 
data volumes observed in the first half of 2024. Linkage processing 
costs would be reduced from approximately $27,000 per day to $0 per 
day, resulting in estimated annual linkage processing savings of 
$7,128,000 ($27,000/day x 264 days). Data processing costs (i.e., costs 
attributable to data ingestion and preparation and publication of data 
versions to the relevant regulatory interfaces) would be reduced from 
approximately $27,000 per day to $9,000 per day, resulting in estimated 
annual data processing savings of $4,752,000 ($18,000/day x 264 days). 
In the aggregate, linkage processing and data processing savings would 
total $11,880,000, or approximately $12 million, based on data volumes 
observed in the first half of 2024. If data volumes continue to 
increase as they have historically, the associated costs avoided would 
similarly increase.
    Storage Requirements. The Plan Processor estimates that 
approximately $8 million in savings would be attributable to the 
reduction in the storage footprint for Options Market Maker quotes in 
Listed Options through the elimination of versioned quote data (i.e., 
T+2 8 a.m. ET, T+5 8 a.m. ET, DIVER and OLA copies). The $8 million in 
savings assumes a reduction of the current production storage footprint 
of approximately 37.5 petabytes (PB) per month based on data volumes 
from the first half of 2024 to approximately 9 PB per month spread 
across the S3 Intelligent Tiers (Frequent Access, Infrequent Access, 
and Archive Instant Access).\24\
---------------------------------------------------------------------------

    \24\ Specific to storage cost estimates, S3 Intelligent Tier 
storage fees in production are allocated at a ratio of 1 (S3 
Frequent Access): 1 (S3 Infrequent Access): 8 (S3 Archive Instant 
Access). This ratio describes the current percentage distribution of 
data files between storage tiers, which is driven by regulatory 
usage. Data files that are either new or that have recently been 
read by regulatory users are stored in S3 Frequent Access. If a file 
is not read by a regulatory user for 30 days, then it moves to S3 
Infrequent Access. Similarly, if a file is not read by a regulatory 
user for 90 days, then it moves to S3 Archive Instant Access. Based 
on current observed regulatory usage, the Plan Processor's storage 
cost model is based on a 1:1:8 ratio across the S3 storage tiers. If 
regulatory users begin to read more older data files, then those 
files would be moved up to S3 Frequent Access, and the 1:1:8 ratio 
between the S3 storage tiers would change. Because each S3 storage 
tier has its own cost-per-petabyte of data, any change in the 1:1:8 
ratio based on regulatory usage would affect storage costs.
---------------------------------------------------------------------------

    Query Requirements. As described in the SRO Letter, the Plan 
Processor estimates that the continued optimization of Options Market 
Maker quotes in Listed Options to make them available via DIVER would 
cost approximately $2.8 million per year. This estimate consists of (i) 
$2.2 million per year in compute costs for producing the DIVER-specific 
hash partition copy of Options Market Maker quotes; \25\ and (ii) 
$600,000 per year in storage costs for one year's worth of DIVER-
specific copies of Options Market Maker quotes.\26\ These amounts are 
included in the processing and storage estimates described above.
---------------------------------------------------------------------------

    \25\ The $2.2 million estimate was calculated by multiplying (x) 
the cost of DIVER-specific ETL jobs for Options Market Maker quotes, 
which is approximately $13,500 per day, by (y) a 65 percent 
allocation of compute time toward Options Market Maker quotes for 
Participant options data and multiplying that result by (z) 252 
trading days in a year.
    \26\ The $600,000 estimate was calculated by multiplying (x) the 
total storage of DIVER-specific copies, which is 0.0542 petabytes 
per day by (y) a 90 percent allocation of storage toward Options 
Market Maker quotes based on record volume and multiplying that 
result by (z) 252 trading days in a year.
---------------------------------------------------------------------------

2. Storage for Raw Unprocessed Data and Interim Operational Copies of 
CAT Data Older Than 15 Days: Estimated Annual Savings of $1 Million

    The Proposed Cost Savings Amendments would save approximately $1 
million annually by permitting the Plan Processor to move raw 
unprocessed data (i.e., as-submitted data) and interim operational data 
older than 15 days to a more cost-effective storage tier that is 
optimized for infrequent access.
    The estimated $1 million in reduced storage costs are attributable 
to storage pricing for Glacier Deep Archive, currently the lowest 
storage tier available on AWS cloud, and are based on data volumes 
observed in the first half of 2024.\27\
---------------------------------------------------------------------------

    \27\ The affected data currently represents approximately 52% of 
the daily storage footprint in CAT. Specifically, raw unprocessed 
data (i.e., as-submitted data) represents approximately 16% of the 
daily storage footprint, and interim operational copies (i.e., T+1 
12 p.m. ET, T+1 9 p.m. ET, and associated DIVER copies) represent 
approximately 36% of the daily storage footprint.
---------------------------------------------------------------------------

    CAT LLC reiterates that the affected data provides minimal 
regulatory value after the final corrected data version is delivered by 
T+5 at 8 a.m. ET. When a regulator queries CAT data, the CAT provides 
results to the user based on the latest, most current version of the 
data. As required by the CAT NMS Plan, prior to 12:00 p.m. on T+1, raw 
unprocessed data (i.e., as-submitted data) that has been ingested by 
the Plan Processor must be available to Participants' regulatory staff 
and the SEC. Between T+1 and T+5, the CAT query tools will return the 
latest iteration of processed data available. Any interim data versions 
are ultimately supplanted in all CAT query tools by the final version 
of corrected data that is made available at T+5 at 8:00 a.m. ET. 
Accordingly, raw unprocessed data and the various iterations of interim 
operational data delivered between T+1 and T+5 provide minimal 
regulatory value after T+5, and regulators are unlikely to access this 
data after T+5. Currently, regulators may access such data ``without 
manual intervention'' as required by the CAT NMS Plan via the use of 
CAT data management APIs, but after four years of operation, the Plan 
Processor has not seen any regulatory usage of this data.
    CAT LLC further reiterates that it is not proposing to delete this 
data; rather, it is only asking the Commission to allow the Plan 
Processor to move this data to a more cost-effective storage tier 
requiring some ``manual intervention'' in order to save $1 million 
annually. Upon request by the Staff to the CAT Help Desk, archived data 
would be

[[Page 81124]]

restored by the Plan Processor to an accessible storage tier, at which 
point it would be available and searchable electronically by the Staff 
in the same manner it is today.

3. Provision of an Interim CAT-Order-ID on an ``As Requested'' Basis: 
Estimated Annual Savings of $2 Million

    As noted above, after discussions with the Staff, the proposal to 
provide an interim CAT-Order-ID to the Commission on an ``as 
requested'' basis has been withdrawn. Accordingly, the $2 million in 
annual cost savings associated with this proposal have been eliminated. 
The Plan Processor will continue to be required to produce an interim 
CAT-Order-ID on a daily basis.

III. Additional Responses to OIP

A. Processing, Query, and Storage Requirements for Options Market Maker 
Quotes in Listed Options

    Under the Proposed Cost Savings Amendments, Options Market Maker 
quotes in Listed Options will no longer be subject to enrichment 
processing. The Commission requested, ``in addition to the three 
`Eliminated [Enrichments]' discussed in the SRO Letter, . . . more 
information on data elements--namely, a list of fields and variables 
for various event types in current CAT Data--that would no longer be 
directly available, would only be available indirectly (via 
notifications or making of requests to the Plan Processor or other 
entities), or would be available on a delay relative to today.'' \28\
---------------------------------------------------------------------------

    \28\ OIP at 58847. As described in the SRO Letter, the 
``Eliminated Enrichments'' are ``(i) derived next event timestamp; 
(ii) lifecycle sequence number; and (iii) the CAT Lifecycle ID.'' 
SRO Letter at 5. See also Proposed Cost Savings Amendments at 4; 
Notice at 26985.
---------------------------------------------------------------------------

    As previously described, the following data elements will no longer 
be available in CAT under the Proposed Cost Savings Amendments:

    <bullet> Derived Next Event Timestamp/Derived Next Event Epoch 
Timestamp
    <bullet> CAT Lifecycle Sequence Number
    <bullet> CAT Lifecycle ID (i.e., CAT Order ID and Venue Order ID) 
\29\
---------------------------------------------------------------------------

    \29\ The CAT Order ID is the lifecycle ID across all CAT 
Reporters whereas the Venue Order ID is the lifecycle ID within a 
single CAT Reporter. Because option quote events only exist within a 
single CAT Reporter, the CAT Order ID and Venue Order ID are 
identical for such events.

    In addition to the elements previously noted, the Derived Next 
Event Type Code will no longer be available under the proposed 
amendments.
    In addition, the following processing enrichments, which can be 
characterized as linkage metadata, will no longer be available:

<bullet> Intra Venue Link Status Code
<bullet> Unlinked Indicator
<bullet> Lifecycle Assembly Date
<bullet> Associated Lifecycles

    As reflected in the proposed amendment as revised, upon request of 
the SEC or any Participant, the Plan Processor will provide the 
existing code required to derive any eliminated data elements from the 
unprocessed data.
    Finally, the Staff requested information regarding how the ``Top 
Indicator'' data element would be affected under the proposed 
amendments. Plan Participant events do not represent the top of a 
lifecycle. Accordingly, the ``Top Indicator'' is not an enrichment 
available on Plan Participant events.

B. Provision of an Interim CAT-Order-ID on an ``As Requested'' Basis

    The Commission requested certain additional information regarding 
the proposal to provide an interim CAT-Order-ID on an ``as requested'' 
basis.\30\ As noted above, this proposal has been withdrawn after 
discussions with the Staff. Therefore, CAT LLC believes it is no longer 
necessary to respond to this portion of the OIP.

1.2 Technical Environments

    The architecture must include environments for production, 
development, quality assurance testing, disaster recovery, industry-
wide coordinated testing, and individual on-going CAT Reporter 
testing. The building and introduction of environments available to 
CAT Reporters may be phased in to align with the following agreed 
upon implementation milestones:
    <bullet> Development environment--the development environment 
must be created to build, develop, and maintain enhancements and new 
requirements. This environment must be separate from those listed 
below.
    <bullet> Quality assurance environment--a quality assurance (QA) 
environment must be created to allow simulation and testing of all 
applications, interfaces, and data integration points contained in 
the CAT System.
    [cir] The QA environment shall be able to simulate end-to-end 
production functionality and perform with the same operational 
characteristics, including processing speed, as the production 
environment.
    [cir] The QA environment shall support varied types of changes, 
such as, but not limited to, the following:
    <bullet> Application patches;
    <bullet> Bug fixes;
    <bullet> Operating system upgrades;
    <bullet> Introduction of new hardware or software components;
    <bullet> New functionality;
    <bullet> Network changes;
    <bullet> Regression testing of existing functionality;
    <bullet> Stress or load testing (simulation of production-level 
usage); and
    <bullet> Recovery and failover.
    [cir] A comprehensive test plan for each build and subsequent 
releases must be documented.
    <bullet> Production environment--fully operational environment 
that supports receipt, ingestion, processing and storage of CAT 
Data. Backup/disaster recovery components must be included as part 
of the production environment.
    <bullet> Industry test environment--
    [cir] The Plan Processor must provide an environment supporting 
industry testing (test environment) that is functionally equivalent 
to the production environment, including:
    <bullet> End-to-end functionality (e.g., data validation, 
processing, linkage, error identification, correction and reporting 
mechanism) from ingestion to output, sized to meet the standards of 
the production SLA;
    <bullet> Performance metrics that mirror the production 
environment; and
    <bullet> Management with the same information security policies 
applicable to the production environment.
    [cir] The industry test environment must also contain 
functionality to support industry testing, including:
    <bullet> Minimum availability of 24x6;
    <bullet> Replica of production data when needed for testing;
    <bullet> Data storage sized to meet varying needs, dependent 
upon scope and test scenarios; and
    <bullet> Support of two versions of code (current and pending).
    [cir] The industry test environment must support the following 
types of industry testing:
    <bullet> Technical upgrades made by the Plan Processor;
    <bullet> CAT code releases that impact CAT Reporters;
    <bullet> Changes to industry data feeds (e.g., SIP, OPRA, etc.);
    <bullet> Industry-wide disaster recovery testing;
    <bullet> Individual CAT Reporter and Data Submitter testing of 
their upgrades against CAT interfaces and functionality; and
    <bullet> Multiple, simultaneous CAT Reporter testing.
    [cir] The industry test environment must be a discrete 
environment separate from the production environment.
    [cir] The Plan Processor must provide the linkage processing of 
data submitted during coordinated, scheduled, industry-wide testing. 
Results of the linkage processes must be communicated back to 
Participants as well as to the Operating Committee.
    [cir] Data from industry testing must be saved for three months. 
Notwithstanding any other provision of the CAT NMS Plan, this 
Appendix D, or Exchange Act Rule 17a-1, such test data (whether 
related to the CAT order and transaction system or the customer 
account and information system) may be deleted by the Plan Processor 
after three months. Operational metrics associated with industry 
testing (including but not limited to testing results, firms who 
participated, and amount of data reported and linked) must be stored 
for the same duration as the CAT production data.
    [cir] The Plan Processor must provide support for industry 
testing, including testing procedures, coordination of industry 
testing, publish notifications, and provide help desk support during 
industry testing.
    [cir] The Participants and the SEC must have access to industry 
test data.
* * * * *

1.4 Data Retention Requirements

    The Plan Processor must develop a formal record retention policy 
and program for the CAT, to be approved by the Operating Committee, 
which will, at a minimum:
    <bullet> Contain requirements associated with data retention, 
maintenance, destruction, and holds;
    <bullet> Comply with applicable SEC record-keeping requirements;
    <bullet> Have a record hold program where specific CAT Data can 
be archived offline for as long as necessary;
    <bullet> Store and retain both raw data submitted by CAT 
Reporters and processed data; and
    <bullet> Make data directly available and searchable 
electronically without manual intervention for at least six years, 
subject to the exceptions in Section 6.3 of Appendix D.
* * * * *

3. Reporting and Linkage Requirements

    All CAT Data reported to the Central Repository must be 
processed and assembled to create the complete lifecycle of each 
Reportable Event. Reportable Events must contain data elements 
sufficient to ensure the same regulatory coverage currently provided 
by existing regulatory reporting systems that have been identified 
as candidates for retirement.
    Additionally, the Central Repository must be able to:
    <bullet> Assign a unique CAT-Reporter-ID to all reports 
submitted to the system based on sub-identifiers, (e.g., MPIDs, 
ETPID, trading mnemonic) currently used by CAT Reporters in their 
order handling and trading processes.
    <bullet> Handle duplicate sub-identifiers used by members of 
different Participants to be properly associated with each 
Participant.
    <bullet> Generate and associate one or more Customer-IDs with 
all Reportable Events representing new orders received from a 
Customer(s) of a CAT Reporter. The Customer-ID(s) will be generated 
from a Firm Designated ID provided by the CAT Reporter for each such 
event, which will be included on all new order events.
    <bullet> Accept time stamps on order events handled 
electronically to the finest level of granularity captured by CAT 
Reporters. Additionally, the CAT must be able to expand the time 
stamp field to accept time stamps to an even finer granularity as 
trading systems expand to capture time stamps in ever finer 
granularity. The Plan Processor must normalize all processed date/
time CAT Data into a standard time zone/format.
    In addition, the data required from CAT Reporters will include 
all events and data elements required by the Plan Processor in the 
Technical Specifications to build the:
    <bullet> Life cycle of an order for defined events within a CAT 
Reporter;
    <bullet> Life cycle of an order for defined events intra-CAT 
Reporter; and
    <bullet> State of all orders across all CAT Reporters at any 
point in time.
    The Plan Processor must use the ``daisy chain approach'' to link 
and create the order lifecycle. In the daisy chain approach, a 
series of unique order identifiers, assigned to all order events 
handled by CAT Reporters are linked together by the Central 
Repository and assigned a single CAT-generated CAT-Order-ID that is 
associated with each individual order event and used to create the 
complete lifecycle of an order.
    By using the daisy chain approach the Plan Processor must be 
able to link all related order events from all CAT Reporters 
involved in the lifecycle of an order. At a minimum, the Central 
Repository must be able to create the lifecycle between:
    <bullet> All order events handled within an individual CAT 
Reporter, including orders routed to internal desks or departments 
with different functions (e.g., an internal ATS);
    <bullet> Customer orders to ``representative'' orders created in 
firm accounts for the purpose of facilitating a customer order 
(e.g., linking a customer order handled on a riskless principal 
basis to the street-side proprietary order);
    <bullet> Orders routed between broker-dealers;
    <bullet> Orders routed from broker-dealers to exchanges;
    <bullet> Orders sent from an exchange to its routing broker-
dealer;

[[Page 81126]]

    <bullet> Executed orders and trade reports;
    <bullet> Various legs of option/equity complex orders; and
    <bullet> Order events for all equity and option order handling 
scenarios that are currently or may potentially be used by CAT 
Reporters, including:
    [cir] Agency route to another broker-dealer or exchange;
    [cir] Riskless principal route to another broker-dealer or 
exchange capturing within the lifecycle both the customer leg and 
street side principal leg;
    [cir] Orders routed from one exchange through a routing broker-
dealer to a second exchange;
    [cir] Orders worked through an average price account capturing 
both the individual street side execution(s) and the average price 
fill to the Customer;
    [cir] Orders aggregated with other orders for further routing 
and execution capturing both the street side executions for the 
aggregated order and the fills to each customer order;
    [cir] Complex orders involving one or more options legs and an 
equity leg, with a linkage between the option and equity legs;
    [cir] Complex orders containing more legs than an exchange's 
order management system can accept, causing the original order to be 
broken into multiple orders;
    [cir] Orders negotiated over the telephone or via a negotiation 
system;
    [cir] Orders routed on an agency basis to a foreign exchange;
    [cir] Execution of customer order via allocation of shares from 
a pre-existing principal order;
    [cir] Market maker quotes; and
    [cir] Complex orders involving two or more options legs.
    Additionally, the Central Repository must be able to:
    <bullet> Link each order lifecycle back to the originating 
Customer;
    <bullet> Integrate and appropriately link reports representing 
repairs of original submissions that are rejected by the CAT due to 
a failure to meet a particular data validation;
    <bullet> Integrate into the CAT and appropriately link reports 
representing records that are corrected by a CAT Reporter for the 
purposes of correcting data errors not identified in the data 
validation process;
    <bullet> Assign a single CAT-Order-ID to all events contained 
within the lifecycle of an order so that regulators can readily 
identify all events contained therein; and
    <bullet> Process and link Manual Order Events with the remainder 
of the associated order lifecycle.
    As described in Section 3.4 of Appendix D, Options Market Maker 
quotes in Listed Options will be subject to ingestion only and will 
not be subject to any linkage requirements.
* * * * *

3.4 Requirements for Options Market Maker Quotes in Listed Options

    The provisions of this section shall govern the processing and 
storage of Options Market Maker quotes in Listed Options and shall 
override any conflicting provisions in the CAT NMS Plan, this 
Appendix D, or Exchange Act Rule 17a-1.
    Options Market Maker quotes in Listed Options must be reported 
to the Central Repository as provided under Section 6.4(d)(iii) of 
the CAT NMS Plan. This data will undergo ingestion validation only 
and such unlinked data will be made available to regulators by T+1 
at 12:00 p.m. Eastern Time. Options Market Maker quotes in Listed 
Options will not be subject to any requirement to link and create an 
order lifecycle, and will not undergo any linkage validation, 
linkage feedback, or lifecycle enrichment processing, but will 
undergo ingestion validation. Options Market Maker quotes in Listed 
Options will be accessible through BDSQL and Direct Read interfaces 
only and will not be accessible through the online targeted query 
tool.
    Upon request of the SEC or any Participant, the Plan Processor 
will provide the business and technical requirements needed to re-
create the eliminated enrichments, as well as the code (which is 
unique to the Plan Processor's linkage implementation) existing as 
of the effective date of this provision used to derive the 
eliminated enrichments. The Plan Processor will not maintain the 
business and technical requirements and the code following the 
effective date of this provision, but it will retain a copy so that 
they may be provided to any regulators that might request them in 
the future.
* * * * *

6.1 Data Processing

    CAT order events must be processed within established timeframes 
to ensure data can be made available to Participants' regulatory 
staff and the SEC in a timely manner. The processing timelines start 
on the day the order event is received by the Central Repository for 
processing.
    Most events must be reported to the CAT by 8:00 a.m. Eastern 
Time the Trading Day after the order event occurred (referred to as 
transaction date). The processing timeframes below are presented in 
this context. All events submitted after T+1 (either reported late 
or submitted later because not all of the information was available) 
must be processed within these timeframes based on the date they 
were received.
    The Participants require the following timeframes (Figure A) for 
the identification, communication and correction of errors from the 
time an order event is received by the processor:
    <bullet> Noon Eastern Time T+1 (transaction date + one day)--
Initial data validation, lifecycle linkages and communication of 
errors to CAT Reporters;
    <bullet> 8:00 a.m. Eastern Time T+3 (transaction date + three 
days)--Resubmission of corrected data; and
    <bullet> 8:00 a.m. Eastern Time T+5 (transaction date + five 
days)--Corrected data available to Participant regulatory staff and 
the SEC.
    Late submissions or re-submissions (after 8:00 a.m.) may be 
considered to be processed that day if it falls within a given time 
period after the cutoff. This threshold will be determined by the 
Plan Processor and approved by the Operating Committee. In the event 
that a significant portion of the data has not been received as 
monitored by the Plan Processor, the Plan Processor may decide to 
halt processing pending submission of that data.
[GRAPHIC] [TIFF OMITTED] TN07OC24.011


[[Page 81127]]


    For the avoidance of doubt, processing and storage of Options 
Market Maker quotes in Listed Options shall be governed by Section 
3.4 of Appendix D.
* * * * *

6.3 Exceptions to Data Availability Requirements

    Notwithstanding any other provision of the CAT NMS Plan, this 
Appendix D, or Exchange Act Rule 17a-1, the following types of data 
may be retained in an archive storage tier. Archived data is not 
directly available and searchable electronically without manual 
intervention and will not be subject to any query tool performance 
requirements until it is restored to an accessible storage tier. The 
Plan Processor will restore archived data to an accessible storage 
tier upon request to the CAT Help Desk by an authorized regulatory 
user from the Participants or a senior officer from the SEC.
    <bullet> Raw Unprocessed Data older than 15 days. ``Raw 
Unprocessed Data'' means data that has been ingested by the Plan 
Processor and made available to regulators prior to 12:00 p.m. 
Eastern Time on T+1.
    <bullet> Interim Operational Data older than 15 days. ``Interim 
Operational Data'' means all processed, validated and unlinked data 
made available to regulators by T+1 at 12:00 p.m. ET and all 
iterations of processed data made available to regulators between 
T+1 and T+5, but excludes the final version of corrected data that 
is made available at T+5 at 8:00 a.m. ET. For the avoidance of 
doubt, ``Interim Operational Data'' does not include processed data 
relating to Options Market Maker quotes in Listed Options made 
available to regulators by T+1 at 12:00 p.m. ET.
    <bullet> All submission and feedback files older than 15 days.
* * * * *

8.1 Regulator Access

    The Plan Processor must provide Participants' regulatory staff 
and the SEC with access to all CAT Data for regulatory purposes 
only. Participants' regulatory staff and the SEC will access CAT 
Data to perform functions, including economic analyses, market 
structure analyses, market surveillance, investigations, and 
examinations.
    The CAT must be able to support, at a minimum, 3,000 regulatory 
users within the system. It is estimated that approximately 20% of 
all users will use the system on a daily or weekly basis while 
approximately 10% of all users will require advanced regulator-user 
access, as described below. Furthermore, it is estimated that there 
may be approximately 600 concurrent users accessing the CAT at any 
given point in time. These users must be able to access and use the 
system without an unacceptable decline in system performance.\29\
---------------------------------------------------------------------------

    \29\ Specific performance requirements will be included in the 
SLA.
---------------------------------------------------------------------------

    As stated in Appendix D, Data Security, the Plan Processor must 
be able to support an arbitrary number of user roles. Defined roles 
must include, at a minimum:
    <bullet> Basic regulator users--Individuals with approved access 
who plan to use the Central Repository to run basic queries (e.g., 
pulling all trades in a single stock by a specific party).
    <bullet> Advanced regulator users--Individuals with approved 
access who plan to use the Central Repository to construct and run 
their own complex queries.
    Regulators will have access to processed CAT Data through two 
different methods, an online-targeted query tool and user-defined 
direct queries and bulk extracts.
    As described in Section 3.4 of Appendix D, Options Market Maker 
quotes in Listed Options will be accessible through BDSQL and Direct 
Read interfaces only and will not be accessible through the online 
targeted query tool.

3.4 Requirements for Options Market Maker Quotes in Listed Options

    The provisions of this section shall govern the processing and

[and related Reportable Events] and shall override any conflicting 
provisions in the CAT NMS Plan, this Appendix D, or Exchange Act 
Rule 17a-1.

reported to the Central Repository as provided under Section 
6.4(d)(iii) of the CAT NMS Plan. This data will undergo ingestion 
validation only and such unlinked data will be made available to 
regulators by T+1 at 12:00 p.m. Eastern Time. Options Market Maker 
[Quotes]quotes in Listed Options will not be subject to any 
requirement to link and create an order lifecycle, and will not 
undergo any linkage validation, linkage feedback, [linkage,] or 
lifecycle enrichment processing, but will undergo ingestion 
validation. Options Market Maker [Quotes]quotes in Listed Options 
will be accessible through BDSQL and Direct Read interfaces only and 
will not be accessible through the online targeted query tool.
    Upon request of the SEC or any Participant, the Plan Processor 
will provide the business and technical requirements needed to re-
create the eliminated enrichments, as well as the code (which is 
unique to the Plan Processor's linkage implementation) existing as 
of the effective date of this provision used to derive the 
eliminated enrichments. The Plan Processor will not maintain the 
business and technical requirements and the code following the 
effective date of this provision, but it will retain a copy so that 
they may be provided to any regulators that might request them in 
the future.

6.1 Data Processing

    CAT order events must be processed within established timeframes 
to ensure data can be made available to Participants' regulatory 
staff and the SEC in a timely manner. The processing timelines start 
on the day the order event is received by the Central Repository for 
processing. Most events must be reported to the CAT by 8:00 a.m. 
Eastern Time the Trading Day after the order event occurred 
(referred to as transaction date). The processing timeframes below 
are presented in this context. All events submitted after T+1 
(either reported late or submitted later because not all of the 
information was available) must be processed within these timeframes 
based on the date they were received.
    The Participants require the following timeframes (Figure A) for 
the identification, communication and correction of errors from the 
time an order event is received by the processor:
    <bullet> Noon Eastern Time T+1 (transaction date + one day)--
Initial data validation, lifecycle linkages and communication of 
errors to CAT Reporters;
    <bullet> 8:00 a.m. Eastern Time T+3 (transaction date + three 
days)--Resubmission of corrected data; and
    <bullet> 8:00 a.m. Eastern Time T+5 (transaction date + five 
days)--Corrected data available to Participant regulatory staff and 
the SEC.
    Late submissions or re-submissions (after 8:00 a.m.) may be 
considered to be processed that day if it falls within a given time 
period after the cutoff. This threshold will be determined by the 
Plan Processor and approved by the Operating Committee. In the event 
that a significant portion of the data has not been received as 
monitored by the Plan Processor, the Plan Processor may decide to 
halt processing pending submission of that data.

    [Where there is an immediate regulatory need (for example, in 
the case of a major market event), upon request of a senior officer 
of the Division of Trading and Markets, the Division of Enforcement, 
or the Division of Examinations to CAT LLC, the Plan Processor shall 
be directed to create an interim CAT-Order-ID and make it available 
to regulators by T+1 at 9 p.m. ET if the request is received prior 
to T+1 at 8 a.m. ET, or generally within 14 hours of receiving the 
request if such request was received after T+1 at 8 a.m. ET.]
    For the avoidance of doubt, processing and storage of Options 
Market Maker [Quotes]quotes in Listed Options [and related 
Reportable Events] shall be governed by Section 3.4 of Appendix D.

6.3 Exceptions to Data Availability Requirements

    Notwithstanding any other provision of the CAT NMS Plan, this

be made available upon request by Participant regulatory staff or 
the SEC to the CAT Help Desk]. Archived data is not directly 
available and searchable electronically without manual intervention 
and will not be subject to any query tool performance requirements 
until it is restored to an accessible storage tier. The Plan 
Processor will restore archived data to an accessible storage tier 
upon request to the CAT Help Desk by an authorized regulatory user 
from the Participants or a senior officer from the SEC.

interim operational data older than 15 days. Interim operational 
data includes all processed, validated and unlinked data made 
available to regulators by T+1 at 12:00 p.m. ET, and all iterations 
of processed data made available to regulators between T+1 and T+5, 
but excludes the final version of corrected data that is made
