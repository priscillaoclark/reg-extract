Electronic Availability

    This document and additional information concerning OFAC are 
available on OFAC's website: <a href="https://ofac.treasury.gov/">https://ofac.treasury.gov/</a>.

Background

    On May 28, 2009, OFAC issued the Darfur Sanctions Regulations, 31 
CFR part 546 (74 FR 25432, May 28, 2009) (the ``Regulations'') to 
implement Executive Order (E.O.) 13400 of April 26, 2006, ``Blocking 
Property of Persons in Connection with the Conflict in Sudan's Darfur 
Region'' (71 FR 25483, May 1, 2006). The Regulations were issued 
pursuant to authorities delegated to the Secretary of the Treasury in 
E.O. 13400, which expanded the scope of the national emergency declared 
in E.O. 13067 of November 3, 1997, ``Blocking Sudanese Government 
Property and Prohibiting Transactions with Sudan'' (62 FR 59989, 
November 5, 1997) with respect to the policies and actions of the 
Government of Sudan. Since then, OFAC has amended the Regulations 
several times. OFAC is now amending the Regulations to implement 
provisions of E.O. 14098, ``Imposing Sanctions on Certain Persons 
Destabilizing Sudan and Undermining the Goal of a Democratic 
Transition'' (88 FR 29529, May 5, 2023). In addition, OFAC is amending 
the Regulations to update or add new definitions, general licenses, and 
interpretative guidance, among other regulatory provisions. 
Furthermore, OFAC is renaming the Darfur Sanctions Regulations as the 
Sudan Stabilization Sanctions Regulations to reflect the expanded scope 
of the national emergency, as set forth in E.O. 14098.
    On May 4, 2023, the President, invoking the authority of, inter 
alia, the International Emergency Economic Powers Act (50 U.S.C. 1701 
et seq.) (IEEPA), issued E.O. 14098. In E.O. 14098, the President 
expanded the scope of the national emergency declared in E.O. 13067, 
and expanded by E.O. 13400, finding that the situation in Sudan, 
including the military's seizure of power in October 2021 and the 
outbreak of inter-service fighting in April 2023, constitutes an 
unusual and extraordinary threat to the national security and foreign 
policy of the United States.
    Section 1(a) of E.O. 14098 blocks, with certain exceptions, all 
property and interests in property that are in the United States, that 
come within the United States, or that are or come within the 
possession or control of any U.S. person of: (i) any foreign person 
determined by the Secretary of the Treasury, in consultation with the 
Secretary of State, to be responsible for, or complicit in, or to have 
directly or indirectly engaged or attempted to engage in, any of the 
following: (A) actions or policies that threaten the peace, security, 
or stability of Sudan; (B) actions or policies that obstruct, 
undermine, delay, or impede, or pose a significant risk of obstructing, 
undermining, delaying, or impeding, the formation or operation of a 
civilian transitional government, Sudan's transition to democracy, or a 
future democratically elected government; (C) actions or policies that 
have the purpose or effect of undermining democratic processes or 
institutions in Sudan; (D) censorship or other actions or policies that 
prohibit, limit, or penalize the exercise of freedoms of expression, 
association, or peaceful assembly by individuals in Sudan, or that 
limit access to free and independent news or information in or with 
respect to Sudan; (E) corruption, including bribery, misappropriation 
of state assets, and interference with public processes such as 
government oversight of parastatal budgets and revenues for personal 
benefit; (F) serious human rights abuse, including serious human rights 
abuse related to political repression, in or with respect to Sudan; (G) 
the targeting of women, children, or any other civilians through the 
commission of acts of violence (including killing, maiming, torture, or 
rape or other sexual violence), abduction, forced displacement, or 
attacks on schools, hospitals, religious sites, or locations where 
civilians are seeking refuge, or through conduct that would constitute 
a serious abuse or violation of human rights or a violation of 
international humanitarian law; (H) the obstruction of the activities 
of United Nations missions--including peacekeeping missions, as well as 
diplomatic or humanitarian missions--in Sudan, or of the delivery of, 
distribution of, or access to humanitarian assistance; or (I) attacks 
against United Nations missions, including peacekeeping operations; 
(ii) any foreign person determined by the Secretary of the Treasury, in 
consultation with the Secretary of State, to be or have been a leader, 
official, senior executive officer, or member of the board of directors 
of any entity: (A) that has, or whose members have, engaged in any 
activity described in subsection (a)(i) of E.O. 14098 relating to the 
tenure of such leader, official, senior executive officer, or member of 
the board of directors; or (B) whose property and interests in property 
are blocked pursuant to E.O. 14098 relating to the tenure of such 
leader, official, senior executive officer, or member of the board of 
directors; (iii) any foreign person determined by the Secretary of the 
Treasury, in consultation with the Secretary of State, to be a spouse 
or adult child of any person whose property and interests in property 
are blocked pursuant to E.O. 14098; (iv) any foreign person determined 
by the Secretary of the Treasury, in consultation with the Secretary of 
State, to have materially assisted, sponsored, or provided financial, 
material, or technological support for, or goods or services to or in 
support of, any activity described in section 1(a)(i) of E.O. 14098 or 
any person whose property and interests in property are blocked 
pursuant to E.O. 14098; or (v) any foreign person determined by the 
Secretary of the Treasury, in consultation with the Secretary of State, 
to be owned or controlled by, or to have acted or purported to act for 
or on behalf of, directly or indirectly, any person whose property and 
interests in property are blocked pursuant to E.O. 14098. The blocked 
property and interests in property of the persons described above may 
not be transferred, paid, exported, withdrawn, or otherwise dealt in.
    Section 1(b) of E.O. 14098 provides that the prohibitions in 
section 1(a) of E.O. 14098 apply except to the extent

[[Page 15745]]

provided by statutes, or in regulations, orders, directives, or 
licenses that may be issued pursuant to E.O. 14098, and notwithstanding 
any contract entered into or any license or permit granted before the 
date of E.O. 14098.
    Section 3 of E.O. 14098 provides that the prohibition on any 
transaction or dealing in blocked property or interests in property 
includes the making of any contribution or provision of funds, goods, 
or services by, to, or for the benefit of any person whose property and 
interests in property are blocked pursuant to E.O. 14098, and the 
receipt of any contribution or provision of funds, goods, or services 
from any such person.
    In Section 4 of E.O. 14098, the President determined that the 
making of donations of the types of articles specified in section 
203(b)(2) of IEEPA (50 U.S.C. 1702(b)(2)), by, to, or for the benefit 
of any person whose property and interests in property are blocked 
pursuant to E.O. 14098 would seriously impair the President's ability 
to deal with the national emergency declared in E.O. 13067, as 
expanded. The President therefore prohibited the donation of such items 
except to the extent provided by statutes, or in regulations, rulings, 
instructions, orders, directives, or licenses that may be issued 
pursuant to E.O. 14098.
    Section 5 of E.O. 14098 prohibits any transaction that evades or 
avoids, has the purpose of evading or avoiding, causes a violation of, 
or attempts to violate any of the prohibitions set forth in E.O. 14098, 
as well as any conspiracy formed to violate such prohibitions.
    Section 9 of E.O. 14098 authorizes the Secretary of the Treasury, 
in consultation with the Secretary of State, to take such actions, 
including the promulgation of rules and regulations, and to employ all 
powers granted to the President by IEEPA as may be necessary to carry 
out the purposes of E.O. 14098. Section 9 of E.O. 14098 also provides 
that the Secretary of the Treasury may, consistent with applicable law, 
redelegate any of these functions within the Department of the 
Treasury.

Current Regulatory Action

    In furtherance of the purposes of E.O. 14098, OFAC is changing the 
heading of the Darfur Sanctions Regulations, 31 CFR part 546, to the 
Sudan Stabilization Sanctions Regulations and amending the renamed 
Regulations to implement E.O. 14098, among other changes. In 
particular, in subpart B of the Regulations, OFAC is revising Sec.  
546.201 to incorporate the new designation criteria provided in E.O. 
14098, as well as adding Sec.  546.201(e) to implement any future 
Executive orders issued pursuant to E.O. 13067. Accordingly, throughout 
the Regulations, OFAC is amending all references to Sec.  546.201(a) to 
references to Sec.  546.201. In addition, OFAC is adding Sec.  546.206 
to detail transactions that are exempt from the prohibitions of the 
Regulations pursuant to section 203(b) of IEEPA (50 U.S.C. 1702(b)).
    In subpart C of the Regulations, new definitions are being added to 
other key terms used throughout the Regulations. Because these new 
definitions were inserted in alphabetical order, the definitions that 
were in the prior abbreviated set of regulations have been renumbered. 
Specifically, OFAC is clarifying that the term OFAC means the Office of 
Foreign Assets Control, providing a definition for foreign person at 
Sec.  546.306, and adding definitional guidance at Sec.  546.300 
clarifying that the terms defined in subpart C apply throughout the 
Regulations. Furthermore, OFAC is updating multiple definitions, 
including its definition of the term effective date at Sec.  546.303.
    In subpart D, which contains interpretive sections regarding the 
Regulations, OFAC is amending several interpretive provisions to align 
with the aforementioned changes to subpart B, as well as updating 
several provisions for clarity. OFAC has also added an interpretive 
provision at Sec.  546.412 to clarify that the property and interests 
in property of an entity, including any political subdivision, agency, 
or instrumentality of a governmental entity, are not blocked solely 
because one or more persons whose property and interests in property 
are blocked pursuant to Sec.  546.201 is a member, leader, official, 
senior executive officer, or otherwise exercises control.
    Transactions otherwise prohibited by the Regulations but found to 
be consistent with U.S. policy may be authorized by one of the general 
licenses contained in subpart E of the Regulations or by a specific 
license issued pursuant to the procedures described in subpart E of 31 
CFR part 501. OFAC is updating Sec.  546.502 to conform with current 
statements of licensing policy and revising Sec.  546.511, which 
authorizes certain transactions for the official business of certain 
international organizations and entities, and Sec.  546.513, which 
authorizes certain transactions related to the provision of 
agricultural commodities, medicine, medical devices, replacement parts 
and components, or software updates, and the extraction, processing, 
transport, sale, or distribution of water in Sudan. OFAC has also added 
Sec.  546.508, which authorizes certain payments for legal services 
from funds originating outside the United States. In addition, the 
interpretive provisions that were in the prior set of regulations have 
been renumbered.
    In subpart G of the Regulations, OFAC is revising several sections 
to describe the civil and criminal penalties applicable to violations 
of the Regulations, as well as the procedures governing the potential 
imposition of a civil monetary penalty or issuance of a Finding of 
Violation. OFAC is adding Sec.  546.705 describing the procedures 
governing the potential issuance of a Finding of Violation. Finally, in 
subpart H of the Regulations, OFAC is updating a section heading at 
Sec.  546.802 to reflect the delegation of certain authorities of the 
Secretary of the Treasury.
    Throughout the Regulations, OFAC is changing references to ``the 
Office of Foreign Assets Control'' and ``the Director of the Office of 
Foreign Assets Control'' to ``OFAC'' for purposes of clarity and 
simplicity.

Public Participation

    Because the Regulations involve a foreign affairs function, the 
provisions of E.O. 12866 of September 30, 1993, ``Regulatory Planning 
and Review'' (58 FR 51735, October 4, 1993), as amended, and the 
Administrative Procedure Act (5 U.S.C. 553) requiring notice of 
proposed rulemaking, opportunity for public participation, and delay in 
effective date are inapplicable. Because no notice of proposed 
rulemaking is required for this rule, the Regulatory Flexibility Act (5 
U.S.C. 601-612) does not apply.

Paperwork Reduction Act

    The collections of information related to the Regulations are 
contained in 31 CFR part 501 (the ``Reporting, Procedures and Penalties 
Regulations''). Pursuant to the Paperwork Reduction Act of 1995 (44 
U.S.C. 3507), those collections of information have been approved by 
the Office of Management and Budget under control number 1505-0164. An 
agency may not conduct or sponsor, and a person is not required to 
respond to, a collection of information unless the collection of 
information displays a valid control number.

[[Page 15747]]

This prohibition includes but is not limited to the transfer (including

    (d) The prohibitions in paragraph (a) of this section apply except

2006 and E.O. 14098 of May 4, 2023 are prohibited pursuant to this 
part.

    Note 1 to Sec.  546.201. The names of persons listed in, or 
designated or identified as blocked pursuant to E.O. 13067, or any 
further Executive orders issued pursuant to the national emergency 
declared therein, whose property and interests in property therefore 
are blocked pursuant to this section, are published in the Federal 
Register and incorporated into OFAC's Specially Designated Nationals 
and Blocked Persons List (SDN List) using the following identifiers: 
for E.O. 13400: ``[DARFUR]''; for E.O. 14098: ``[SUDAN-EO14098]''; 
and for any further Executive orders issued pursuant to the national 
emergency declared in E.O. 13067 using the identifier formulation 
``[SUDAN-E.O.[E.O. number pursuant to which the person's property 
and interests in property are blocked]].'' The SDN List is 
accessible through the following page on OFAC's website: 
<a href="http://www.treasury.gov/sdn">www.treasury.gov/sdn</a>. Additional information pertaining to the SDN 
List can be found in appendix A to this chapter. See Sec.  546.411 
concerning entities that may not be listed on the SDN List but whose 
property and interests in property are nevertheless blocked pursuant 
to this section.


    Note 2 to Sec.  546.201. Section 203 of the International 
Emergency Economic Powers Act (50 U.S.C. 1702) authorizes the 
blocking of property and interests in property of a person during 
the pendency of an investigation. The names of persons whose 
property and interests in property are blocked pending investigation 
pursuant to this section also are published in the Federal Register 
and incorporated into the SDN List using the following identifiers: 
for E.O. 13400: ``[BPI-DARFUR]''; for E.O. 14098, ``[BPI-SUDAN-
EO14098]''; and for any further Executive orders issued pursuant to 
the national emergency declared in E.O. 13067: using the identifier 
formulation ``[BPI-SUDAN-[E.O. number pursuant to which the person's 
property and interests in property are blocked pending 
investigation]].''


    Note 3 to Sec.  546.201. Sections 501.806 and 501.807 of this 
chapter describe the procedures to be followed by persons seeking, 
respectively, the unblocking of funds that they believe were blocked 
due to mistaken identity, or administrative reconsideration of their 
status as persons whose property and interests in property are 
blocked pursuant to this section.

pursuant to this part.
* * * * *
    (f) Unless licensed pursuant to this part, any attachment,

exercises control.

    (a) The property and interests in property of an entity, including 
any political subdivision, agency, or instrumentality of a governmental 
entity, are not blocked solely because one or more persons whose 
property and interests in property are blocked pursuant to Sec.  
546.201 is a member, leader, official, senior executive officer, or 
otherwise exercises control.

    Note 1 to paragraph (a). See Sec.  546.411 concerning the 
blocked status of property and interests in property of an entity 
that is directly or indirectly owned, whether individually or in the 
aggregate, 50 percent or more by one or more persons whose property 
and interests in property are blocked pursuant to Sec.  546.201.

cautious in engaging in transactions with any entity of which a 
person whose property and interests in property are blocked pursuant 
to Sec.  546.201 is a member, leader, official, senior executive 
officer, or otherwise exercises control to ensure that U.S. persons 
are not engaged in transactions, directly or indirectly, with a 
blocked person, except as authorized or exempt pursuant to this 
part.

28. Revise Sec.  546.502 to read as follows:


Sec.  546.502  Effect of license or other authorization.

    (a) No license or other authorization contained in this part, or 
otherwise issued by OFAC, authorizes or validates any transaction 
effected prior to the issuance of such license or other authorization, 
unless specifically provided in such license or authorization.
    (b) No regulation, ruling, instruction, order, directive, or 
license authorizes any transaction prohibited under this part unless 
the regulation, ruling, instruction, order, directive, or license is 
issued by OFAC and specifically refers to this part. No regulation, 
ruling, instruction, order, directive, or license referring to this 
part shall be deemed to authorize any transaction prohibited by any 
other part of this chapter unless the regulation, ruling, instruction, 
order, directive, or license specifically refers to such part.
    (c) Any regulation, ruling, instruction, order, directive, or 
license authorizing any transaction prohibited under this part has the 
effect of removing a prohibition contained in this part from the 
transaction, but only to the extent specifically stated by its terms. 
Unless the regulation, ruling, instruction, order, directive, or 
license otherwise specifies, such an authorization does not create any 
right, duty, obligation, claim, or interest in, or with respect to, any 
property that would not otherwise exist under ordinary principles of 
law.
    (d) Nothing contained in this part shall be construed to supersede 
the requirements established under any other provision of law or to 
relieve a person from any requirement to obtain a license or other 
authorization from another department or agency of the U.S. government 
in compliance with applicable laws and regulations subject to the 
jurisdiction of that department or agency. For example, exports of 
goods, services, or technical data that are not prohibited by this part 
or that do not require a license by OFAC nevertheless may require 
authorization by the U.S. Department of Commerce, the U.S. Department 
of State, or other agencies of the U.S. government.
    (e) No license or other authorization contained in or issued 
pursuant to this part authorizes transfers of or payments from blocked 
property or debits to blocked accounts unless the license or other 
authorization explicitly authorizes the transfer of or payment from 
blocked property or the debit to a blocked account.
    (f) Any payment relating to a transaction authorized in or pursuant 
to this part that is routed through the U.S. financial system should 
reference the

[[Page 15750]]

relevant OFAC general or specific license authorizing the payment to 
avoid the blocking or rejection of the transfer.

or enforcement of U.S. sanctions against such persons; and
    (5) Provision of legal services in any other context in which 
prevailing U.S. law requires access to legal counsel at public expense.
    (b) The provision of any other legal services to or on behalf of 
persons whose property and interests in property are blocked pursuant 
to Sec.  546.201, not otherwise authorized in this part, requires the 
issuance of a specific license.
    (c) U.S. persons do not need to obtain specific authorization to 
provide related services, such as making filings and providing other 
administrative services, that are ordinarily incident to the provision 
of services authorized by paragraph (a) of this section. Additionally, 
U.S. persons who provide services authorized by paragraph (a) of this 
section do not need to obtain specific authorization to contract for 
related services that are ordinarily incident to the provision of those 
legal services, such as those provided by private investigators or 
expert witnesses, or to pay for such services. See Sec.  546.404.
    (d) Entry into a settlement agreement or the enforcement of any 
lien, judgment, arbitral award, decree, or other order through 
execution, garnishment, or other judicial process purporting to 
transfer or otherwise alter or affect property or interests in property 
blocked pursuant to Sec.  546.201 is prohibited unless licensed 
pursuant to this part.

this chapter, U.S. persons seeking administrative reconsideration or 
judicial review of their designation or the blocking of their

services using funds in which any other person whose property and 
interests in property are blocked pursuant to Sec.  546.201, any other 
part of this chapter, or any Executive order or statute has an 
interest.
    (b) Records. Consistent with Sec.  501.601 of this chapter, U.S. 
persons who receive payments pursuant to paragraph (a) of this section 
must retain for five years from the date of the relevant payment a

the penalty is imposed.
    (3) A person who willfully commits, willfully attempts to commit, 
willfully conspires to commit, or aids or abets in the commission of a

36. Revise Sec.  546.702 to read as follows:


Sec.  546.702  Pre-Penalty Notice; settlement.

    (a) When required. If OFAC has reason to believe that there has 
occurred a violation of any provision of this part or a violation of 
the provisions of any regulation, ruling, instruction, order, 
directive, or license issued by or pursuant to the direction or 
authorization of the Secretary of the Treasury pursuant to this part or 
otherwise under the International Emergency Economic Powers Act (50 
U.S.C. 1701 et seq.) and determines that a civil monetary penalty is 
warranted, OFAC will issue a Pre-Penalty Notice informing the alleged 
violator of the agency's intent to impose a monetary penalty. A Pre-
Penalty Notice shall be in writing. The Pre-Penalty Notice may be 
issued whether or not another agency has taken any action with respect 
to the matter. For a description of the contents of a Pre-Penalty 
Notice, see appendix A to part 501 of this chapter.
    (b) Response--(1) Right to respond. An alleged violator has the 
right to respond to a Pre-Penalty Notice by making a written 
presentation to OFAC. For a description of the information that should 
be included in such a response, see appendix A to part 501 of this 
chapter.
    (2) Deadline for response. A response to a Pre-Penalty Notice must 
be made within 30 days as set forth in paragraphs (b)(2)(i) and (ii) of 
this section. The failure to submit a response within 30 days shall be 
deemed to be a waiver of the right to respond.
    (i) Computation of time for response. A response to a Pre-Penalty 
Notice must be postmarked or date-stamped by the U.S. Postal Service 
(or foreign postal service, if mailed abroad) or courier service 
provider (if transmitted to OFAC by courier), or dated if sent by 
email, on or before the 30th day after the postmark date on the 
envelope in which the Pre-Penalty Notice was mailed or date the Pre-
Penalty Notice was emailed. If the Pre-Penalty Notice was personally 
delivered by a non-U.S. Postal Service agent authorized by OFAC, a 
response must be postmarked or date-stamped on or before the 30th day 
after the date of delivery.
    (ii) Extensions of time for response. If a due date falls on a 
federal holiday or weekend, that due date is extended to include the 
following business day. Any other extensions of time will be granted, 
at the discretion of OFAC, only upon specific request to OFAC.
    (3) Form and method of response. A response to a Pre-Penalty Notice 
need not be in any particular form, but it must be typewritten and 
signed by the alleged violator or a representative thereof (electronic 
signature is acceptable), contain information sufficient to indicate 
that it is in response to the Pre-Penalty Notice, and include the OFAC 
identification number listed on the Pre-Penalty Notice. The response 
must be sent to OFAC's Enforcement Division by mail or courier or email 
and must be postmarked or

[[Page 15752]]

date-stamped in accordance with paragraph (b)(2) of this section.
    (c) Settlement. Settlement discussion may be initiated by OFAC, the 
alleged violator, or the alleged violator's authorized representative. 
For a description of practices with respect to settlement, see appendix 
A to part 501 of this chapter.
    (d) Guidelines. Guidelines for the imposition or settlement of 
civil penalties by OFAC are contained in appendix A to part 501 of this 
chapter.
    (e) Representation. A representative of the alleged violator may 
act on behalf of the alleged violator, but any oral communication with 
OFAC prior to a written submission regarding the specific allegations 
contained in the Pre-Penalty Notice must be preceded by a written 
letter of representation, unless the Pre-Penalty Notice was served upon 
the alleged violator in care of the representative.

37. Add Sec.  546.705 to read as follows:


Sec.  546.705  Findings of Violation.

    (a) When issued. (1) OFAC may issue an initial Finding of Violation 
that identifies a violation if OFAC:
    (i) Determines that there has occurred a violation of any provision 
of this part, or a violation of the provisions of any regulation, 
ruling, instruction, order, directive, or license issued by or pursuant 
to the direction or authorization of the Secretary of the Treasury 
pursuant to this part or otherwise under the International Emergency 
Economic Powers Act (50 U.S.C. 1701 et seq);
    (ii) Considers it important to document the occurrence of a 
violation; and
    (iii) Based on the Guidelines contained in appendix A to part 501 
of this chapter, concludes that an administrative response is warranted 
but that a civil monetary penalty is not the most appropriate response.
    (2) An initial Finding of Violation shall be in writing and may be 
issued whether or not another agency has taken any action with respect 
to the matter. For additional details concerning issuance of a Finding 
of Violation, see appendix A to part 501 of this chapter.
    (b) Response--(1) Right to respond. An alleged violator has the 
right to contest an initial Finding of Violation by providing a written 
response to OFAC.
    (2) Deadline for response; default determination. A response to an 
initial Finding of Violation must be made within 30 days as set forth 
in paragraphs (b)(2)(i) and (ii) of this section. The failure to submit 
a response within 30 days shall be deemed to be a waiver of the right 
to respond, and the initial Finding of Violation will become final and 
will constitute final agency action. The violator has the right to seek 
judicial review of that final agency action in federal district court.
    (i) Computation of time for response. A response to an initial 
Finding of Violation must be postmarked or date-stamped by the U.S. 
Postal Service (or foreign postal service, if mailed abroad) or courier 
service provider (if transmitted to OFAC by courier), or dated if sent 
by email, on or before the 30th day after the postmark date on the 
envelope in which the initial Finding of Violation was served or date 
the Finding of Violation was sent by email. If the initial Finding of 
Violation was personally delivered by a non-U.S. Postal Service agent 
authorized by OFAC, a response must be postmarked or date-stamped on or 
before the 30th day after the date of delivery.
    (ii) Extensions of time for response. If a due date falls on a 
federal holiday or weekend, that due date is extended to include the 
following business day. Any other extensions of time will be granted, 
at the discretion of OFAC, only upon specific request to OFAC.
    (3) Form and method of response. A response to an initial Finding 
of Violation need not be in any particular form, but it must be 
typewritten and signed by the alleged violator or a representative 
thereof (electronic signature is acceptable), contain information 
sufficient to indicate that it is in response to the initial Finding of 
Violation, and include the OFAC identification number listed on the 
initial Finding of Violation. The response must be sent to OFAC's 
Enforcement Division by mail or courier or email and must be postmarked 
or date-stamped in accordance with paragraph (b)(2) of this section.
    (4) Information that should be included in response. Any response 
should set forth in detail why the alleged violator either believes 
that a violation of the regulations did not occur and/or why a Finding 
of Violation is otherwise unwarranted under the circumstances, with 
reference to the General Factors Affecting Administrative Action set 
forth in the Guidelines contained in appendix A to part 501 of this 
chapter. The response should include all documentary or other evidence 
available to the alleged violator that supports the arguments set forth 
in the response. OFAC will consider all relevant materials submitted in 
the response.
    (c) Determination--(1) Determination that a Finding of Violation is 
warranted. If, after considering the response, OFAC determines that a 
final Finding of Violation should be issued, OFAC will issue a final 
Finding of Violation that will inform the violator of its decision. A 
final Finding of Violation shall constitute final agency action. The 
violator has the right to seek judicial review of that final agency 
action in federal district court.
    (2) Determination that a Finding of Violation is not warranted. If, 
after considering the response, OFAC determines a Finding of Violation 
is not warranted, then OFAC will inform the alleged violator of its 
decision not to issue a final Finding of Violation.

    Note 1 to paragraph (c)(2).  A determination by OFAC that a 
final Finding of Violation is not warranted does not preclude OFAC 
from pursuing other enforcement actions consistent with the 
Guidelines contained in appendix A to part 501 of this chapter.
    (d) Representation. A representative of the alleged violator may 
act on behalf of the alleged violator, but any oral communication 
with OFAC prior to a written submission regarding the specific 
alleged violations contained in the initial Finding of Violation 
must be preceded by a written letter of representation, unless the 
initial Finding of Violation was served upon the alleged violator in 
care of the representative.
