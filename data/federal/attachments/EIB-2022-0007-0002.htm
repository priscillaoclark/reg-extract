EXPORT-IMPORT BANK


Updated Intent To Conduct a Detailed Economic Impact Analysis

AGENCY: Export-Import Bank.

ACTION: Notice.

-----------------------------------------------------------------------

SUMMARY: This notice is to inform the public that the Export-Import 
Bank of the United States has received has received a request to 
increase the financed amount for a previously notified application (FR 
Doc. 2022-19164). The application is now for a $99.7 million direct 
loan to support the export of approximately $63.88 million in U.S. 
equipment and services to upgrade and expand an oil refinery in 
Indonesia. There has been no change in the expected output of the 
facility, and the supported U.S. exports will still enable the facility 
to increase production capacity of gasoline by 101,000 barrels per day 
and propylene by 225,000 tons per year. Available information indicates 
that the refined products will be consumed domestically, with 
negligible sales to other markets.

DATES: Comments are due 14 days from publication in the Federal 
Register.
