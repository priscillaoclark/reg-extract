SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION: The FDIC is requesting OMB approval for the 
following new collection of information:
    1. Title: 2025 FDIC Survey of Deposit Insurance Awareness.
    OMB Number: 3064-NEW.
    Affected Public: Individual members of the public.
    Burden Estimate:

    Frequency of Response: Once.
    Estimated Number of Respondents: 6,500.
    Average Time per Response: 4 minutes.
    Estimated Total Annual Burden: 26,000 minutes (434 hours).

    General Description of Collection: The FDIC proposes to field a 
statistical consumer survey to assess awareness of the FDIC and of 
deposit insurance. Survey results will inform FDIC public awareness, 
communication, education, outreach and research efforts regarding 
deposit insurance, and will identify information and awareness gaps in 
terms of content and demographic segments. Research questions will 
cover consumers' knowledge of, attitudes towards, and behaviors 
regarding deposit insurance. The proposed 2025 FDIC Survey of Deposit 
Insurance Awareness is intended to collect information regarding what 
consumers know about deposit insurance and how they learn it, what 
consumers think about deposit insurance and banking, and how this 
information shapes financial decisions. The survey will inform research 
and programmatic efforts to improve consumers' awareness and 
understanding of deposit insurance, to help fulfill the agency's 
mission of maintaining stability and public confidence in the nation's 
financial system.
    The survey will assess consumers' awareness and knowledge of the 
FDIC and its role regarding deposit insurance, including their 
understanding of the types of institutions and situations where deposit 
insurance applies, and the sources they use to learn about deposit 
insurance. The survey will also assess whether deposit insurance 
impacts consumers' confidence in the banking system and perceptions and 
use of bank and nonbank financial services, including their likelihood 
to consider deposit insurance when making decisions about financial 
products and services. Finally, the survey will collect background 
information regarding consumers' use of some bank and nonbank products, 
and the types of institutions they use to save or store money inside 
and outside of the banking system.
    The survey will be conducted in spring 2025 as part of Porter 
Novelli's PN Styles survey, using the IPSOS Knowledge Panel, a 
probability-based online panel in the US. PN Styles is a large-scale, 
representative survey of U.S. adults that tracks consumer attitudes and 
behaviors. Interested members of the public may obtain a copy of the 
proposed survey questionnaire on the following web page: <a href="https://www.fdic.gov/federal-register-publications/fdic-deposit-insurance-awareness-survey">https://www.fdic.gov/federal-register-publications/fdic-deposit-insurance-awareness-survey</a>.
