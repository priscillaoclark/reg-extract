    Section 19(b)(2) of the Act \6\ provides that within forty-five 
days of the publication of notice of the filing of a proposed rule 
change, or within such longer period up to ninety days as the 
Commission may designate if it finds such longer period to be 
appropriate and publishes its reasons for so finding or as to which the 
self-regulatory organization consents, the Commission shall either 
approve the proposed rule change, disapprove the proposed rule change, 
or institute proceedings to determine whether the proposed rule change

sufficient time to consider this proposed rule change, which would 
create a new listing market on the Exchange, and to consider the 
comment letters that have been submitted in connection with this 
proposed rule change.
    Accordingly, the Commission, pursuant to Section 19(b)(2) of the 
Act,\7\ designates December 7, 2010, as the date by which the 
Commission should either approve or disapprove or institute proceedings 
to determine whether to disapprove the proposed rule change.
