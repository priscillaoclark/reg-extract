SECURITIES AND EXCHANGE COMMISSION

[Release No. 34-101759; File No. 4-845]


Self-Regulatory Organizations; MIAX Emerald, LLC; Notice of 
Filing of Proposed Minor Rule Violation Plan

November 26, 2024.
    Pursuant to Section 19(d)(1) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 
(the ``Act''),\1\ and Rule 19d-1(c)(2) thereunder,\2\ notice is hereby 
given that on November 19, 2024, MIAX Emerald, LLC (``Emerald'' or the 
``Exchange'') filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission 
(``Commission'') a proposed minor rule violation plan (``MRVP'') with 
sanctions not exceeding $2,500 which would not be subject to the 
provisions of Rule 19d-1(c)(1) of the Act \3\ requiring that a self-
regulatory organization (``SRO'') promptly file notice with the 
Commission of any final disciplinary action taken with respect to any 
person or organization.\4\ In accordance with Rule 19d-1(c)(2) under 
the Act,\5\ the Exchange proposes to designate certain specified rule 
violations as minor rule violations, and requests that it be relieved 
of the prompt reporting requirements regarding such violations, 
provided it gives notice of such violations to the Commission on a 
quarterly basis.
---------------------------------------------------------------------------

    \1\ 15 U.S.C. 78s(d)(1).
    \2\ 17 CFR 240.19d-1(c)(2).
    \3\ 17 CFR 240.19d-1(c)(1).
    \4\ The Commission adopted amendments to paragraph (c) of Rule 
19d-1 to allow SROs to submit for Commission approval plans for the 
abbreviated reporting of minor disciplinary infractions. See 
Securities Exchange Act Release No. 21013 (June 1, 1984), 49 FR 
23828 (June 8, 1984). Any disciplinary action taken by an SRO 
against any person for violation of a rule of the SRO which has been 
designated as a minor rule violation pursuant to such a plan filed 
with and declared effective by the Commission shall not be 
considered ``final'' for purposes of Section 19(d)(1) of the Act if 
the sanction imposed consists of a fine not exceeding $2,500 and the 
sanctioned person has not sought an adjudication, including a 
hearing, or otherwise exhausted his administrative remedies.
    \5\ 17 CFR 240.19d-1(c)(2).
---------------------------------------------------------------------------

    The Exchange proposes to include in its MRVP the procedures and 
violations currently included in Exchange Rule 1014 (``Imposition of 
Fines for Minor Rule Violations'').\6\ According to the Exchange's 
proposed MRVP, under Rule 1014, the Exchange may impose a fine (not to 
exceed $2,500) on any Member, or person associated with or employed by 
a Member, for any rule violation listed in Rule 1014(d).\7\ The 
Exchange shall serve the person against whom a fine is imposed with a 
written statement setting forth the rule or rules allegedly violated, 
the act or omission constituting each such violation, the fine imposed 
for each violation, and the date by which such determination becomes 
final or by which such determination must be paid or contested. If the 
person against whom the fine is imposed pays the fine, such payment 
shall be deemed to be a waiver of such person's right to a disciplinary 
proceeding and any review of the matter under the Exchange rules. Any 
person against whom a fine is imposed may contest the Exchange's 
determination by filing with the Exchange a written answer, at which 
point the matter shall become a disciplinary proceeding.
---------------------------------------------------------------------------

    \6\ The Exchange received its grant of registration on December 
20, 2018, which included approving the rules that govern the 
Exchange. The Exchange notes that certain chapters of the Exchange's 
rules are incorporated by reference from the rules of the Exchange's 
affiliate Miami International Securities Exchange, LLC (MIAX 
Options). Specifically, Chapter X, DISCIPLINE, which contains Rule 
1014, Imposition of Fines for Minor Rule Violations.
    \7\ While Rule 1014 allows the Exchange to administer fines up 
to $5,000, the Exchange is only seeking relief from the reporting 
requirements of paragraph (c)(1) of Rule 19d-1 for fines 
administered under Rule 1014(d) that do not exceed $2,500.
---------------------------------------------------------------------------

    The Exchange proposes that, as set forth in Exchange Rule 1014(d), 
violations of the following rules would be appropriate for disposition 
under the MRVP: Rule 307 (Position Limits); Rule 803 (Focus Reports); 
Rule 804 (Requests for Trade Data); Rule 520 (Order Entry); Rule 603 
(Quotation Parameters); Rule 605 (Execution of Orders in Appointed 
Options); Rule 314 (Mandatory Systems Testing); Rule 700 (Exercise of 
Option Contracts); Rule 309 (Exercise Limits); Rule 310 (Reports 
Related to Position Limits); Rule 403 (Trading in Restricted Classes); 
Rule 604 (Market Maker Quotations); Rule 1904 (Failure to Timely File 
Amendments to Form U4, Form U5, and Form BD); and Rules 1701-1713 
(Failure to Comply with the Consolidated Audit Trail Compliance Rule 
Under Chapter XVII). The Exchange states that it is specifically 
excluding Rule 1014(d)(4), Conduct and Decorum Policies, from this 
filing.
    Upon the Commission's declaration of effectiveness of the MRVP, the 
Exchange will provide to the Commission a quarterly report for any 
actions taken on minor rule violations under the MRVP. The quarterly 
report will include: the disposition date, the name of the firm/
individual, the Exchange's internal enforcement number, the review 
period, the nature of the violation type, the number of the rule that 
was violated, the number of instances the violation occurred, and the 
sanction imposed.
    Based on compliance with the above, the Exchange requests that the 
rule violations designated in Rule 1014(d) be designated as minor rule 
violations subject to a minor rule violation reporting plan and that 
the Exchange be relieved of the current reporting requirements 
regarding such violations. In addition, going forward, to the extent 
that there are any changes to the rules applicable to the Exchange's 
MRVP, the Exchange requests that the Commission deem such changes to be 
modifications to the Exchange's MRVP.
