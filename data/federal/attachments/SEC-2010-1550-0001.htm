Extension:

    Rule 425; OMB Control No. 3235-0521; SEC File No. 270-462.

    Notice is hereby given that, pursuant to the Paperwork Reduction 
Act of 1995 (44 U.S.C. 3501 et seq.), the Securities and Exchange 
Commission (``Commission'') has submitted to the Office of Management 
and Budget the request for extension of the previously approved 
collection of information discussed below.
    Rule 425 (17 CFR 230.425) under the Securities Act of 1933 (15 
U.S.C. 77a et seq.) requires the filing of certain prospectuses and 
communications under Rule 135 (17 CFR 230.135) and Rule 165 (17 CFR 
230.165) in connection with business combination transactions. The 
purpose of the rule is to permit more oral and written communications 
with shareholders about tender offers, mergers and other business 
combination transactions on a more timely basis, so long as the written 
communications are filed on the date of first use. The information 
provided under Rule 425 is made available to the public upon request. 
Also, the information provided under Rule 425 is mandatory. 
Approximately 1,680 issuers file communications under Rule 425 at an 
estimated 0.25 hours per response for a total of 420 annual burden 
hours.
    An agency may not conduct or sponsor, and a person is not required 
to respond to, a collection of information unless it displays a 
currently valid control number.
    Written comments regarding the above information should be directed 
to the following persons: (i) Desk Officer for the Securities and 
Exchange Commission, Office of Information and Regulatory Affairs, 
Office of Management and Budget, Room 10102, New Executive Office 
Building, Washington, DC 20503 or send an e-mail to: <A HREF="mailto:Shagufta_Ahmed@omb.eop.gov">Shagufta_
Ahmed@omb.eop.gov</A>; and (ii) Jeffrey Heslop, Acting Director/CIO, Office 
of Information Technology, Securities and Exchange Commission, C/O Remi 
Pavlik-Simon, 6432 General Green Way, Alexandria, Virginia 22312; or 
send e-mail to: <A HREF="mailto:PRA_Mailbox@sec.gov">PRA_Mailbox@sec.gov</A>. Comments must be submitted to OMB 
within 30 days of this notice.

Florence E. Harmon,
Deputy Secretary.
