II. Self-Regulatory Organization's Statement of the Purpose of, and 
Statutory Basis for, the Proposed Rule Change

    In its filing with the Commission, the self-regulatory organization 
included statements concerning the purpose of, and basis for, the 
proposed rule change and discussed any comments it received on the 
proposed rule change. The text of those statements may be examined at 
the places specified in Item IV below. The Exchange has prepared 
summaries, set forth in sections A, B, and C below, of the most 
significant parts of such statements.

A. Self-Regulatory Organization's Statement of the Purpose of, and 
Statutory Basis for, the Proposed Rule Change

1. Purpose
    The purpose of the proposed rule change is to amend Rule 4560--NYSE 
Amex Equities (Short-Interest Reporting) to correspond with a rule 
change filed by FINRA and approved by the Commission.
Background
    On July 30, 2007, FINRA's predecessor, the National Association of 
Securities Dealers, Inc. (``NASD''), and NYSE Regulation, Inc. 
(``NYSER'') consolidated their member firm regulation operations into a 
combined organization, FINRA. Pursuant to Rule 17d-2 under the Act, the 
New York Stock Exchange LLC (``NYSE''), NYSER and FINRA entered into an 
agreement (the ``Agreement'') to reduce regulatory duplication for 
their members by allocating to FINRA certain regulatory 
responsibilities for certain NYSE rules and rule interpretations 
(``FINRA Incorporated NYSE Rules''). The Exchange became a party to the 
Agreement effective December 15, 2008.\5\
---------------------------------------------------------------------------

    \5\ See Securities Exchange Act Release Nos. 56148 (July 26, 
2007), 72 FR 42146 (August 1, 2007) (order approving the Agreement); 
56147 (July 26, 2007), 72 FR 42166 (August 1, 2007) (SR-NASD-2007-
054) (order approving the incorporation of certain NYSE Rules as 
``Common Rules''); and 60409 (July 30, 2009), 74 FR 39353 (August 6, 
2009) (order approving the amended and restated Agreement, adding 
NYSE Amex LLC as a party). Paragraph 2(b) of the Agreement sets 
forth procedures regarding proposed changes by FINRA, NYSE or NYSE 
Amex to the substance of any of the Common Rules.

---------------------------------------------------------------------------

[[Page 60156]]

    As part of its effort to reduce regulatory duplication and relieve 
firms that are members of FINRA, NYSE and NYSE Amex of conflicting or 
unnecessary regulatory burdens, FINRA is now engaged in the process of 
reviewing and amending the NASD and FINRA Incorporated NYSE Rules in 
order to create a consolidated FINRA rulebook.\6\
---------------------------------------------------------------------------

    \6\ FINRA's rulebook currently has three sets of rules: (1) NASD 
Rules, (2) FINRA Incorporated NYSE Rules, and (3) consolidated FINRA 
Rules. The FINRA Incorporated NYSE Rules apply only to those members 
of FINRA that are also members of the NYSE, while the consolidated 
FINRA Rules apply to all FINRA members. For more information about 
the FINRA rulebook consolidation process, see FINRA Information 
Notice, March 12, 2008.
---------------------------------------------------------------------------

Current Rule 4560--NYSE Amex Equities
    The Exchange adopted Rule 4560--NYSE Amex Equities in May 2009.\7\ 
Rule 4560--NYSE Amex Equities requires each member organization to 
maintain a record of the total short positions in its customer and 
proprietary accounts in securities listed on a national securities 
exchange and that such information must be reported to FINRA. Rule 
4560--NYSE Amex Equities is based on, and is substantially the same as, 
FINRA Rule 4560 (Short-Interest Reporting). The principal distinction 
between the two rules is that, as adopted by the Exchange, Rule 4560--
NYSE Amex Equities does not apply to OTC Equity Securities (as defined 
in FINRA Rule 6420) since the Exchange does not trade OTC Equity 
Securities.
---------------------------------------------------------------------------

    \7\ See Securities Exchange Act Release No. 59975 (May 26, 
2009), 74 FR 26449 (June 2, 2009) (order approving NYSEAmex 2009-
26).
---------------------------------------------------------------------------

Proposed Conforming Amendments to Rule 4560--NYSE Amex Equities
    In April 2010, FINRA amended FINRA Rule 4560 to provide, in part, 
that it applies to all equity securities (other than Restricted Equity 
Securities as defined in FINRA Rule 6420) and not just to OTC Equity 
Securities or securities listed on a national securities exchange.\8\ 
The Exchange proposes to amend Rule 4560--NYSE Amex Equities, as 
applicable, to conform with FINRA's amendments to FINRA Rule 4560 so 
that Rule 4560--NYSE Amex Equities applies to all equity securities 
(other than Restricted Equity Securities as defined in FINRA Rule 
6420).
---------------------------------------------------------------------------

    \8\ See Securities Exchange Act Release No. 61979 (April 23, 
2010), 75 FR 23316 (May 3, 2010).
---------------------------------------------------------------------------

2. Statutory Basis
    The Exchange believes that the proposed rule change is consistent 
with Section 6(b) of the Act,\9\ in general, and furthers the 
objectives of Section 6(b)(5) of the Act,\10\ in particular, in that it 
is designed to prevent fraudulent and manipulative acts and practices, 
to promote just and equitable principles of trade, to remove 
impediments to and perfect the mechanism of a free and open market and 
a national market system, and, in general, to protect investors and the 
public interest.
---------------------------------------------------------------------------

    \9\ 15 U.S.C. 78f(b).
    \10\ 15 U.S.C. 78f(b)(5).
---------------------------------------------------------------------------

    The Exchange believes that the proposed rule change supports the 
objectives of the Act by providing greater harmonization between NYSE 
Amex Equities Rules and FINRA Rules of similar purpose, resulting in 
less burdensome and more efficient regulatory compliance for joint 
members. To the extent the Exchange has proposed changes that differ 
from the FINRA version of the Rule, such changes are technical in 
nature and do not change the substance of the proposed NYSE Amex 
Equities Rule.

B. Self-Regulatory Organization's Statement on Burden on Competition

    The Exchange does not believe that the proposed rule change will 
impose any burden on competition that is not necessary or appropriate 
in furtherance of the purposes of the Act.

C. Self-Regulatory Organization's Statement on Comments on the Proposed 
Rule Change Received From Members, Participants, or Others

    No written comments were solicited or received with respect to the 
proposed rule change.

III. Date of Effectiveness of the Proposed Rule Change and Timing for 
Commission Action

    Because the foregoing proposed rule change does not:
    (i) Significantly affect the protection of investors or the public 
interest;
    (ii) impose any significant burden on competition; and
    (iii) become operative for 30 days from the date on which it was 
filed, or such shorter time as the Commission may designate, if 
consistent with the protection of investors and the public interest, it 
has become effective pursuant to Section 19(b)(3)(A) of the Act \11\ 
and Rule 19b-4(f)(6) thereunder.\12\
---------------------------------------------------------------------------

    \11\ 15 U.S.C. 78s(b)(3)(A).
    \12\ 17 CFR 240.19b-4(f)(6). In addition, Rule 19b-4(f)(6)(iii) 
requires the self-regulatory organization to submit to the 
Commission written notice of its intent to file the proposed rule 
change, along with a brief description and text of the proposed rule 
change, at least five business days prior to the date of filing of 
the proposed rule change, or such shorter time as designated by the 
Commission. The Exchange has satisfied this requirement.
---------------------------------------------------------------------------

    At any time within 60 days of the filing of the proposed rule 
change, the Commission summarily may temporarily suspend such rule 
change if it appears to the Commission that such action is necessary or 
appropriate in the public interest, for the protection of investors, or 
otherwise in furtherance of the purposes of the Act.
