---------------------------------------------------------------------------

    On September 25, 2023, pursuant to section 19(b)(2) of the Exchange 
Act,\5\ the Commission designated a longer period within which to

    \7\ Partial Amendment No. 1 delays implementation of the

    Section 19(b)(2) of the Exchange Act \12\ provides that proceedings 
to determine whether to approve or disapprove a proposed rule change 
must be concluded within 180 days of the date of publication of notice 
of filing of the proposed rule change. The time for conclusion of the 
proceedings may be extended for up to 60 days if the Commission 
determines that a longer period is appropriate and publishes the

    The Commission is extending the period for Commission action on the 
Proposed Rule Change, as modified by Partial Amendment No. 1 and
