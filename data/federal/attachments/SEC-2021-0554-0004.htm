SECURITIES AND EXCHANGE COMMISSION

[SEC File No. 270-151, OMB Control No. 3235-0291]


Submission for OMB Review; Comment Request; Extension: Rules 
17Ad-6 and 17Ad-7

Upon Written Request, Copies Available From: Securities and Exchange 
Commission, Office of FOIA Services, 100 F Street NE, Washington, DC 
20549-2736

    Notice is hereby given that pursuant to the Paperwork Reduction Act 
of 1995 (``PRA'') (44 U.S.C. 3501 et seq.), the Securities and Exchange 
Commission (``Commission'') has submitted to the Office of Management 
and Budget (``OMB'') a request for approval of extension of the 
previously approved collection of information provided for in Rule 
17Ad-6 (17 CFR 240.17Ad-6) and Rule 17Ad-7 (17 CFR 240.17Ad-7) under 
the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 (15 U.S.C. 78a et seq.) (``Exchange 
Act'').
    Rule 17Ad-6 under the Exchange Act requires every registered 
transfer agent to make and keep current records about a variety of 
information, such as: (1) specific operational data regarding the time 
taken to perform transfer agent activities (to ensure compliance with 
the minimum performance standards in Rule 17Ad-2 (17 CFR 240.17Ad-2)); 
(2) written inquiries and requests by shareholders and broker-dealers 
and response time thereto; (3) resolutions, contracts, or other 
supporting documents concerning the appointment or termination of the 
transfer agent; (4) stop orders or notices of adverse claims to the 
securities; and (5) all canceled registered securities certificates.
    Rule 17Ad-7 under the Exchange Act requires each registered 
transfer agent to retain the records specified in Rule 17Ad-6 in an 
easily accessible place for a period of six months to six years, 
depending on the type of record or document. Rule 17Ad-7 also specifies 
the manner in which records may be maintained using electronic, 
microfilm, and microfiche storage methods.
    These recordkeeping requirements are designed to ensure that all 
registered transfer agents are maintaining the records necessary for 
transfer agents to monitor and keep control over their own performance 
and for the Commission to adequately examine registered transfer agents 
on an historical basis for compliance with applicable rules.
    The Commission estimates that approximately 315 registered transfer 
agents will spend a total of 157,500 hours per year complying with 
Rules 17Ad-6 and 17Ad-7 (500 hours per year per transfer agent).
    The retention period under Rule 17Ad-7 for the recordkeeping 
requirements under Rule 17Ad-6 is six months to six years, depending on 
the particular record or document. The recordkeeping and retention 
requirements under Rules 17Ad-6 and 17Ad-7 are mandatory to assist the 
Commission and other regulatory agencies with monitoring transfer 
agents and ensuring compliance with the rules.
