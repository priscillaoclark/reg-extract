SUMMARY: The Department of the Treasury's Office of Foreign Assets 
Control (``OFAC'') is amending the Persons Contributing to the Conflict 
in C[ocirc]te d'Ivoire Sanctions Regulations, 31 CFR part 543 (the 
``Regulations''), to change the heading of the Regulations.

DATES: Effective Date: July 21, 2009.

SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION: 

Electronic and Facsimile Availability

    This document and additional information concerning OFAC are 
available from OFAC's Web site (<A HREF="http://frwebgate.access.gpo.gov/cgi-bin/leaving.cgi?from=leavingFR.html&log=linklog&to=http://www.treas.gov/ofac">www.treas.gov/ofac</A>) or via facsimile 
through a 24-hour fax-on demand service, tel.: (202) 622-0077.

Background

    OFAC promulgated the Persons Contributing to the Conflict in 
C[ocirc]te d'Ivoire Sanctions Regulations, 31 CFR part 543 (the 
``Regulations''), on April 13, 2009 (74 FR 16763), to implement 
Executive Order 13396 of February 7, 2006 (``E.O. 13396''). In E.O. 
13396, the President determined that the situation in C[ocirc]te 
d'Ivoire, which has resulted in the massacre of large numbers of 
civilians, widespread human rights abuses, significant political 
violence and unrest, and attacks against international peacekeeping 
forces leading to fatalities, constitutes an unusual and extraordinary 
threat to the national security and foreign policy of the United 
States, and declared a national emergency to deal with that threat.
    OFAC today is amending the Regulations to change their heading to 
the ``C[ocirc]te d'Ivoire Sanctions Regulations'' for the sake of 
consistency with other sanctions regulations.

Public Participation

    Because the Regulations involve a foreign affairs function, the 
provisions of Executive Order 12866 and the Administrative Procedure 
Act (5 U.S.C. 553) requiring notice of proposed rulemaking, opportunity 
for public participation, and delay in effective date are inapplicable. 
Because no notice of proposed rulemaking is required for this rule, the 
Regulatory Flexibility Act (5 U.S.C. 601-612) does not apply.

Paperwork Reduction Act

    The collections of information related to the Regulations are 
contained in 31 CFR part 501 (the ``Reporting, Procedures and Penalties 
Regulations''). Pursuant to the Paperwork Reduction Act of 1995 (44 
U.S.C. 3507), those collections of information have been approved by 
the Office of Management and Budget under control number 1505-0164. An 
agency may not conduct or sponsor, and a person is not required to 
respond to, a collection of information unless the collection of 
information displays a valid control number.

List of Subjects in 31 CFR Part 543

    Administrative practice and procedure, Banks, Banking, Blocking of 
assets, C[ocirc]te d'Ivoire, Credit, Foreign Trade, Penalties, 
Reporting and recordkeeping requirements, Securities, Services.
