    \2\ 17 CFR 240.19b-4.
    \3\ See Securities Exchange Act Release No. 62788 (August 30, 
2010), 75 FR 54676 (``Notice'').
---------------------------------------------------------------------------

II. Description of the Proposed Rule Change

    The Exchange proposes to list and trade Shares of the Fund under 
NYSE Arca Equities Rule 8.600, which governs the listing of Managed 
Fund Shares.\4\ The Shares will be offered by AdvisorShares Trust 
(``Trust''), a statutory trust organized under the laws of the State of 
Delaware and registered with the Commission as an open-end management 
investment company.\5\ The investment advisor to the Fund is 
AdvisorShares Investments, LLC (``Advisor''), and the day-to-day 
portfolio management of the Fund is provided by the sub-advisor to the 
Fund, Cambria Investment Management, Inc. (``Sub-Advisor'').\6\ The 
Exchange represents that the Shares will conform to the initial and 
continued listing criteria under NYSE Arca Equities Rule 8.600 and that 
the Fund will be in compliance with Rule 10A-3 under the Act,\7\ as 
provided by NYSE Arca Equities Rule 5.3.
---------------------------------------------------------------------------

    \4\ See NYSE Arca Equities Rule 8.600.
    \5\ The Trust is registered under the Investment Company Act of 
1940. On June 30, 2010, the Trust filed with the Commission a 
registration statement on Form N-1A (File Nos. 333-157876 and 811-
22110) (``Registration Statement'').
    \6\ The Exchange represents that neither the Advisor nor the 
Sub-Advisor is affiliated with a broker-dealer. See Commentary .06 
to NYSE Arca Equities Rule 8.600.
    \7\ 17 CFR 240.10A-3.
---------------------------------------------------------------------------

    The Fund is a ``fund of funds,'' which means that the Fund seeks to 
invest primarily in other exchange-traded funds listed and traded in 
the United States (``Underlying ETFs'') and certain other exchange-
traded products including, but not limited to, exchange-traded notes, 
exchange-traded currency trusts and closed-end funds. The Fund seeks to 
achieve its investment objective of preserving and growing capital from 
investments in the U.S. and foreign equity, fixed income, commodity and 
currency markets, independent of market direction, by producing 
absolute returns with reduced volatility and manageable risk and 
drawdowns. The Sub-Advisor will utilize a proprietary quantitative 
trend-following approach to actively manage the Fund's portfolio. No 
effort is made by the Sub-Advisor to forecast future market trends or 
direction; rather, the Fund seeks to capture profits in these trends 
when and where they develop. The strategy is diversified across markets 
and timeframes with strict risk control methods that are rules-based 
and systematic. Except for Underlying ETFs that may hold non-U.S. 
issues, the Fund will not otherwise invest in non-U.S. issues.
    Additional information regarding the Fund, the Shares, the Fund's 
investment objective, strategies, methodology, and restrictions, the 
Advisor and Sub-Advisor, risks, fees and expenses, creations and 
redemptions of Shares, availability of information, trading rules and 
halts, and surveillance procedures, among other things, can be found in 
the Registration Statement and in the Notice, as applicable.\8\

    \8\ See supra notes 3 and 5.
---------------------------------------------------------------------------

III. Discussion and Commission's Findings

    After careful review, the Commission finds that the Exchange's 
proposal to list and trade the Shares is consistent with the Act and 
the rules and regulations thereunder applicable to a national 
securities exchange.\9\ In particular, the Commission finds that the 
proposed rule change is consistent with Section 6(b)(5) of the Act,\10\ 
which requires, among other things, that the Exchange's rules be 
designed to promote just and equitable principles of trade, to remove 
impediments to and perfect the mechanism of a free and open market and 
a national market system, and, in general, to protect investors and the 
public interest.
---------------------------------------------------------------------------

    \9\ In approving this proposed rule change, the Commission has 
considered the proposed rule's impact on efficiency, competition, 
and capital formation. See 15 U.S.C. 78c(f).
    \10\ 15 U.S.C. 78f(b)(5).
---------------------------------------------------------------------------

    The Commission finds that the proposal to list and trade the Shares 
on the Exchange is consistent with Section 11A(a)(1)(C)(iii) of the 
Act, which sets forth Congress's finding that it is in the public 
interest and appropriate for the protection of investors and the 
maintenance of fair and orderly markets to assure the availability to 
brokers, dealers and investors of information with respect to 
quotations for and transactions in securities. Quotation and last-sale 
information for the Shares will be available via the Consolidated Tape 
Association high-speed line, and the Exchange will disseminate the 
Portfolio Indicative Value (``PIV'') at least every 15 seconds during 
the Core Trading Session through one or more major market data vendors. 
In addition, the Fund will make available on its website on each 
business day before commencement of the Core Trading Session the 
Disclosed Portfolio that will form the basis for the Fund's calculation 
of the net asset value (``NAV'').\11\ A basket composition file, which 
includes the security names and share quantities required to be 
delivered in exchange for Fund shares, together with estimates and 
actual cash components, will be publicly disseminated daily prior to 
the opening of the NYSE via the National Securities Clearing 
Corporation. The Fund's website will also include additional 
quantitative information updated on a daily basis relating to trading 
volume, the prior business day's reported NAV, mid-point of the bid/ask 
spread at the time of calculation of such NAV (the ``Bid/Ask 
Price''),\12\ and a calculation of the premium and discount of the Bid/
Ask Price against the NAV and data in chart format displaying the 
frequency distribution of discounts and premiums of the daily Bid/Ask 
Price against the NAV, within appropriate ranges, for each of the four 
previous calendar quarters. Information regarding the market price and 
trading volume of the Shares will be continually available on a real-
time basis throughout the day on brokers' computer screens and other 
electronic services, and the previous day's closing price and trading 
volume information for the Shares will be published daily in the 
financial sections of newspapers.
---------------------------------------------------------------------------

    \11\ On a daily basis, the Advisor will disclose for each 
portfolio security or other financial instrument of the Fund the 
following information: Ticker symbol (if applicable), name of 
security or financial instrument, number of shares or dollar value 
of financial instruments held in the portfolio, and percentage 
weighting of the security or financial instrument in the portfolio. 
The NAV of the Fund will normally be determined as of the close of 
the regular trading session on the New York Stock Exchange, Inc. 
(``NYSE'') (ordinarily 4:00 p.m. Eastern Time) on each business day.
    \12\ The Bid/Ask Price of the Fund is determined using the 
midpoint of the highest bid and the lowest offer on the Exchange as 
of the time of calculation of the NAV. The records relating to Bid/
Ask Prices will be retained by the Fund and its service providers.
---------------------------------------------------------------------------

    The Commission further believes that the proposal to list and trade 
the Shares is reasonably designed to promote fair disclosure of 
information that may be necessary to price the Shares appropriately and 
to prevent trading when a reasonable degree of transparency cannot be 
assured. The Commission notes that the Advisor and Sub-Advisor to the 
Fund are not affiliated with a broker-dealer.\13\ The

[[Page 63876]]

Commission also notes that the Exchange will obtain a representation 
from the Fund that the NAV per Share will be calculated daily and that 
the NAV and the Disclosed Portfolio will be made available to all 
market participants at the same time.\14\ Additionally, if it becomes 
aware that the NAV or the Disclosed Portfolio is not disseminated to 
all market participants at the same time, the Exchange will halt 
trading in the Shares until such information is available to all market 
participants. Further, if the PIV is not being disseminated as 
required, the Exchange may halt trading during the day in which the 
interruption occurs; if the interruption persists past the day in which 
it occurred, the Exchange will halt trading no later than the beginning 
of the trading day following the interruption.\15\ Finally, the 
Commission notes that the Reporting Authority that provides the 
Disclosed Portfolio must implement and maintain, or be subject to, 
procedures designed to prevent the use and dissemination of material 
non-public information regarding the actual components of the 
portfolio.\16\
---------------------------------------------------------------------------

    \13\ See Commentary .06 to NYSE Arca Equities Rule 8.600. The 
Commission notes that Commentary .06 to NYSE Arca Equities Rule 
8.600 requires that any investment advisers to the Fund that are 
affiliated with a broker-dealer are required to implement a fire-
wall with respect to such broker-dealer regarding access to 
information concerning the composition of the portfolio. Commentary 
.06 to NYSE Arca Equities Rule 8.600 also requires that any 
personnel who make decisions on the Fund's portfolio composition 
must be subject to procedures designed to prevent the use and 
dissemination of material non-public information regarding the 
portfolio.
    \14\ See NYSE Arca Equities Rule 8.600(d)(1)(B).
    \15\ See NYSE Arca Equities Rule 8.600(d)(2)(D). Trading in the 
Shares may also be halted because of market conditions or for 
reasons that, in the view of the Exchange, make trading in the 
Shares inadvisable. These may include: (1) The extent to which 
trading is not occurring in the securities comprising the Disclosed 
Portfolio and/or the financial instruments of the Fund; or (2) 
whether other unusual conditions or circumstances detrimental to the 
maintenance of a fair and orderly market are present.
    \16\ See NYSE Arca Equities Rule 8.600(d)(2)(B)(ii).
---------------------------------------------------------------------------

    The Exchange has represented that the Shares are equity securities 
subject to the Exchange's rules governing the trading of equity 
securities. In support of this proposal, the Exchange has made 
representations, including:
    (1) The Shares will conform to the initial and continued listing 
criteria under NYSE Arca Equities Rule 8.600.
    (2) The Exchange's surveillance procedures are adequate to properly 
monitor Exchange trading of the Shares in all trading sessions and to 
deter and detect violations of Exchange rules and applicable federal 
securities laws.
    (3) Prior to the commencement of trading, the Exchange will inform 
its ETP Holders in an Information Bulletin of the special 
characteristics and risks associated with trading the Shares. 
Specifically, the Information Bulletin will discuss the following: (a) 
The procedures for purchases and redemptions of Shares and that Shares 
are not individually redeemable; (b) NYSE Arca Equities Rule 9.2(a), 
which imposes a duty of due diligence on its ETP Holders to learn the 
essential facts relating to every customer prior to trading the Shares; 
(c) the risks involved in trading the Shares during the Opening and 
Late Trading Sessions when an updated PIV will not be calculated or 
publicly disseminated; (d) how information regarding the PIV is 
disseminated; (e) the requirement that ETP Holders deliver a prospectus 
to investors purchasing newly issued Shares prior to or concurrently 
with the confirmation of a transaction; and (f) trading information.
    (4) The Fund will be in compliance with Rule 10A-3 under the 
Act.\17\
---------------------------------------------------------------------------

    \17\ 17 CFR 240.10A-3.
---------------------------------------------------------------------------

    (5) Except for Underlying ETFs that may hold non-U.S. issues, the 
Fund will not otherwise invest in non-U.S. issues.
    In addition, the Commission notes that it has not received any 
comments regarding the proposed rule change.
    For the forgoing reasons, the Commission believes that the 
Exchange's proposal to list and trade the Shares is consistent with the 
Act. This order is based on the Exchange's representations.

IV. Conclusion

    It is therefore ordered, pursuant to Section 19(b)(2) of the 
Act,\18\ that the proposed rule change (SR-NYSEArca-2010-79) be, and it 
hereby is, approved.
