Reporting of Security-Based Swap Transaction Data

AGENCY: Securities and Exchange Commission.

ACTION: Interim final temporary rule; request for comments.

-----------------------------------------------------------------------

SUMMARY: Section 766 of Title VII of the Dodd-Frank Wall Street Reform 
and Consumer Protection Act (``Dodd-Frank Act'') requires the 
Securities and Exchange Commission (``Commission'') to adopt an interim 
final rule for the reporting of security-based swaps entered into 
before July 21, 2010, the terms of which had not expired as of that 
date (``pre-enactment security-based swap transactions''), within 90 
days of the enactment of the Dodd-Frank Act. Pursuant to this 
requirement, the Commission today is adopting an interim final 
temporary rule that requires specified counterparties to pre-enactment 
security-based swap transactions to report certain information relating 
to pre-enactment security-based swaps to a registered security-based 
swap data repository or to the Commission by the compliance date 
established in the security-based swap reporting rules required under 
Sections 3C(e) and 13A(a) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 
(``Exchange Act''),\1\ or within 60 days after a registered security-
based swap data repository commences operations to receive and maintain 
data concerning such security-based swaps, whichever occurs first and 
report information relating to pre-enactment security-based swaps to 
the Commission upon request. The Commission also is issuing an 
Interpretive Note to the rule that states that counterparties that may 
be required to report to the Commission will need to preserve 
information pertaining to the terms of these pre-enactment security-
based swaps.
---------------------------------------------------------------------------

    \1\ All references to the Exchange Act contained in this release 
refer to the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended by the 
Dodd-Frank Act.

DATES: Effective Date: Sec.  240.13Aa-2T is effective October 20, 2010 
and will remain in effect until January 12, 2012. If the Commission 
publishes permanent recordkeeping and reporting rules for security-
based transactions before January 12, 2012, that rule will terminate 
the effectiveness of Sec.  240.13Aa-2T.
    Comment Date: Comments on the interim final temporary rule should 
be received on or before December 20, 2010.

I. Introduction

    On July 21, 2010, the President signed into law the Dodd-Frank 
Act.\2\ An important element of the Dodd-Frank Act is Title VII, the 
Wall Street Transparency and Accountability Act of 2010, which directly 
addresses regulation of over-the-counter derivatives (``OTC 
derivatives''). Title VII of the Dodd-Frank Act establishes a 
regulatory framework for OTC derivatives, and makes a number of 
statutory revisions to the Commodity Exchange Act and the Exchange Act 
(``Title VII Amendments''). The Title VII Amendments broadly categorize 
covered products as either swaps, regulated primarily by the Commodity 
Futures Trading Commission (``CFTC''), security-based swaps, regulated 
primarily by the Commission, or mixed swaps, jointly regulated by the 
Commission and the CFTC.
---------------------------------------------------------------------------

    \2\ The Dodd-Frank Wall Street Reform and Consumer Protection 
Act (Pub. L. 11-203, H.R. 4173).
---------------------------------------------------------------------------

    Pursuant to Section 761 of the Dodd-Frank Act, new Section 3(a)(68) 
of the Exchange Act defines a security-based swap to include a swap, as 
defined in Section 1a of the Commodity Exchange Act,\3\ that is based 
on a narrow-based security index, or a single security or loan, or any 
interest therein or on the value thereof, or the occurrence or non-
occurrence of an event relating to an issuer of a security or the 
issuers of securities in a narrow-based index, provided that such event 
directly affects the financial statements, financial condition, or 
financial obligations of the issuer.\4\ Section 761 of the Dodd-Frank 
Act also adds new definitions in Section 3(a) of the Exchange Act \5\ 
for entities involved in the security-based swaps markets, including, 
among others, security-based swap dealer,\6\ major security-based swap 
participant,\7\ security-based swap data repository,\8\ and security-
based swap execution facility.\9\ The Commission has issued an advance 
notice of proposed rulemaking seeking comment on the definitions of key 
terms relating to the regulation of swaps and security-based swaps.\10\
---------------------------------------------------------------------------

    \3\ 7 U.S.C. 1a. Section 721(b) of the Dodd-Frank Act amends 
Section 1(a) of the Commodity Exchange Act to add paragraph (47) 
defining swap, subject to enumerated exceptions, as any agreement, 
contract, or transaction: (i) That is a put, call, cap, floor, 
collar, or similar option of any kind that is for the purchase or 
sale, or based on the value, of 1 or more interest or other rates, 
currencies, commodities, securities, instruments of indebtedness, 
indices, quantitative measures, or other financial or economic 
interests or property of any kind; (ii) that provides for any 
purchase, sale, payment, or delivery (other than a dividend on an 
equity security) that is dependent on the occurrence, nonoccurrence, 
or the extent of the occurrence of an event or contingency 
associated with a potential financial, economic, or commercial 
consequence; (iii) that provides on an executory basis for the 
exchange, on a fixed or contingent basis, of 1 or more payments 
based on the value or level of 1 or more interest or other rates, 
currencies, commodities, securities, instruments of indebtedness, 
indices, quantitative measures, or other financial or economic 
interests or property of any kind, or any interest therein or based 
on the value thereof, and that transfers, as between the parties to 
the transaction, in whole or in part, the financial risk associated 
with a future change in any such value or level without also 
conveying a current or future direct or indirect ownership interest 
in an asset (including any enterprise or investment pool) or 
liability that incorporates the financial risk so transferred, 
including any agreement, contract, or transaction commonly known as 
(I) an interest rate swap; (II) a rate floor; (III) a rate cap; (IV) 
a rate collar; (V) a cross-currency rate swap; (VI) a basis swap; 
(VII) a currency swap; (VIII) a foreign exchange swap; (IX) a total 
return swap; (X) an equity index swap; (XI) an equity swap; (XII) a 
debt index swap; (XIII) a debt swap; (XIV) a credit spread; (XV) a 
credit default swap; (XVI) a credit swap; (XVII) a weather swap; 
(XVIII) an energy swap; (XIX) a metal swap; (XX) an agricultural 
swap; (XXI) an emissions swap; and (XXII) a commodity swap; (iv) 
that is an agreement, contract, or transaction that is, or in the 
future becomes commonly known to the trade as a swap; (v) including 
any security-based swap agreement which meets the definition of 
`swap agreement' as defined in section 206A of the Gramm-Leach-
Bliley Act (15 U.S.C. 78c note) of which a material term is based on 
the price, yield, value, or volatility of any security or any group 
or index of securities, or any interest therein; or (vi) that is any 
combination or permutation of, or option on, any agreement, 
contract, or transaction described in any of clauses (i) through 
(v).
    \4\ See 15 U.S.C. 78c(a)(68).
    \5\ 15 U.S.C. 78c(a).
    \6\ Security-based swap dealer is defined in Section 3(a)(71)(A) 
of the Exchange Act, 15 U.S.C. 78c(a)(71)(A), to mean any person 
who: (i) Holds themself out as a dealer in security-based swaps; 
(ii) makes a market in security-based swaps; (iii) regularly enters 
into security-based swaps with counterparties as an ordinary course 
of business for its own account; or (iv) engages in any activity 
causing it to be commonly known in the trade as a dealer or market 
maker in security-based swaps. The term security-based swap dealer 
does not include a person that enters into security-based swaps for 
such person's own account, either individually or in a fiduciary 
capacity, but not as a part of regular business. 15 U.S.C. 
78c(a)(71)(C). In addition, the Commission shall exempt from 
designation as a security-based swap dealer an entity that engages 
in a de minimis quantity of security-based swap dealing in 
connection with transactions with or on behalf of its customers. 15 
U.S.C. 78c(a)(71)(D).
    \7\ Major security-based swap participant is defined in Section 
3(a)(67)(A) of the Exchange Act, 15 U.S.C. 78c(a)(67)(A), as any 
person: (i) Who is not a security-based swap dealer; and (ii)(I) who 
maintains a substantial position in security-based swaps for any of 
the major security-based swap categories, as such categories are 
determined by the Commission, excluding both positions held for 
hedging or mitigating commercial risk and positions maintained by 
any employee benefit plan (or any contract held by such a plan) as 
defined in paragraphs (3) and (32) of section 3 of the Employee 
Retirement Income Security Act of 1974 (29 U.S.C. 1002) for the 
primary purpose of hedging or mitigating any risk directly 
associated with the operation of the plan; (II) whose outstanding 
security-based swaps create substantial counterparty exposure that 
could have serious adverse effects on the financial stability of the 
United States banking system or financial markets; or (III) that is 
a financial entity that (aa) is highly leveraged relative to the 
amount of capital such entity holds and that is not subject to 
capital requirements established by an appropriate Federal banking 
regulator; and (bb) maintains a substantial position in outstanding 
security-based swaps in any major security-based swap category, as 
such categories are determined by the Commission. For purposes of 
subparagraph (A), the Commission shall define, by rule or 
regulation, the term `substantial position' at the threshold that 
the Commission determines to be prudent for the effective 
monitoring, management, and oversight of entities that are 
systemically important or can significantly impact the financial 
system of the United States. 15 U.S.C. 78c(a)(67)(B).
    \8\ Security-based swap data repository is defined in Section 
3(a)(75) of the Exchange Act, 15 U.S.C. 78c(a)(75), as any person 
that collects and maintains information or records with respect to 
transactions or positions in, or the terms and conditions of, 
security-based swaps entered into by third parties for the purpose 
of providing a centralized recordkeeping facility for security-based 
swaps.
    \9\ Security-based swap execution facility is defined in Section 
3(a)(77) of the Exchange Act, 15 U.S.C. 78c(a)(77), as a trading 
system or platform in which multiple participants have the ability 
to execute or trade security-based swaps by accepting bids and 
offers made by multiple participants in the facility or system, 
through any means of interstate commerce, including any trading 
facility, that (A) facilitates the execution of security-based swaps 
between persons; and (B) is not a national securities exchange.
    The new definitions in Section 3(a) parallel amendments to 
Section 1(a) of the Commodity Exchange Act pursuant to Section 721 
of the Title VII Amendments.
    \10\ See Securities Exchange Act Release No. 62717 (August 13, 
2010), 75 FR 51429 (August 20, 2010).
---------------------------------------------------------------------------

    The Dodd-Frank Act requires, among other things, that security-
based swaps be reported to a registered security-based swap data 
repository or the Commission.\11\ In particular, the Dodd-Frank Act 
added Section 13A(a)(2)(A) of the Exchange Act, which requires that 
pre-enactment security-based swaps be reported to a registered 
security-based swap data repository or the Commission by a date that is 
not later than: (i) 30 days after issuance of the interim final rule; 
or (ii) such other period as the Commission determines to be 
appropriate.\12\ Section 13A(a)(2)(B) of the Exchange Act \13\ requires 
the Commission to promulgate an interim final rule providing for the 
reporting of these pre-enactment security-based swaps within 90 days of 
the enactment of the Dodd-Frank Act.\14\ Consistent

[[Page 64645]]

with its responsibilities under Section 13A(a)(2) of the Exchange Act, 
the Commission is today adopting Rule 13Aa-2T, an interim final 
temporary rule governing reporting of pre-enactment security-based 
swaps.

    \12\ See id.
    \13\ 15 U.S.C. 78m-1(a)(2)(B).
    \14\ The Commission notes that Section 3C of the Exchange Act, 
added by Section 763(a) of the Dodd-Frank Act, also requires the 
Commission to adopt rules that provide for the reporting of data for 
security-based swaps entered into before the date of enactment of 
the Dodd-Frank Act to a registered security-based data repository or 
to the Commission no later than 180 days after the effective date of 
the Dodd-Frank Act (thus, by January 12, 2012). See 15 U.S.C. 78c-
3(e). Section 3C is not effective until 360 days after enactment of 
the Dodd-Frank Act. The Commission believes that its action today is 
consistent with both Section 13A and Section 3C of the Exchange Act.
---------------------------------------------------------------------------

II. Interim Final Temporary Exchange Act Rule 13Aa-2T

    The Commission is adopting Rule 13Aa-2T under the Exchange Act to 
specify the reporting requirements applicable to pre-enactment 
security-based swaps. Rule 13Aa-2T requires specified counterparties to 
a pre-enactment security-based swap transaction to: (1) Report certain 
information relating to pre-enactment security-based swaps to a 
registered security-based swap data repository or to the Commission by 
the compliance date established in the security-based swap reporting 
rules required by Sections 3C(e) and 13A(a)(1) of the Exchange Act, or 
within 60 days after a registered security-based swap data repository 
commences operations to receive and maintain data concerning such 
security-based swaps, whichever occurs first; and (2) report 
information relating to pre-enactment security-based swaps to the 
Commission upon request during an interim period. In addition, the 
Commission is issuing an Interpretive Note to Rule 13Aa2-T that 
reflects what information the Commission believes reporting parties 
should retain in order to meet the reporting obligation contained in 
the rule. Specifically, the Commission believes that counterparties 
will need to preserve information pertaining to the terms of such pre-
enactment security-based swaps, to the extent and in such form as it 
currently exists.
    We have included several requests for comment in this release. We 
will carefully consider the comments that we receive and will address 
them, if applicable, in connection with the permanent reporting rules, 
which will be published for notice and comment.
    As explained above, the Dodd-Frank Act revises Section 3(a) of the 
Exchange Act to define key terms related to the new regulatory 
framework for security-based swaps.\15\ Rule 13Aa-2T(a) incorporates 
the definitions of ``major security-based swap participant,'' 
``security-based swap,'' ``security-based swap dealer,'' and 
``security-based swap data repository'' from the Dodd-Frank Act. The 
statutory language reserves to the Commission authority to further 
define these terms,\16\ which the Commission expects to do as rules are 
developed relating to the regulation of security-based swaps and in 
response to input from market participants. In addition, the Commission 
notes that rules governing the registration of security-based swap data 
repositories will be the subject of another Commission rulemaking. As a 
result, there currently are no registered security-based swap data 
repositories able to accept security-based swap data as required under 
the Dodd-Frank Act.
---------------------------------------------------------------------------

    \15\ See supra Section I.
    \16\ The Title VII Amendments enable the Commission to further 
define certain terms jointly with the CFTC, in consultation with the 
Board of Governors of the Federal Reserve System. See Section 712(d) 
of the Dodd-Frank Act.
---------------------------------------------------------------------------

A. Reporting Obligations

    Rule 13Aa-2T(b)(1) requires that a counterparty to a pre-enactment 
security-based swap transaction shall report, with respect to a pre-
enactment security-based swap transaction, to a registered security-
based swap data repository or to the Commission: (1) A copy of the 
transaction confirmation, in electronic form, if available, or in 
written form, if there is no electronic copy; and (2) the time, if 
available, the transaction was executed.\17\ Rule 13Aa-2T(b)(1) also 
establishes the compliance deadline for reporting pre-enactment 
security-based swap transactions. Pursuant to Rule 13Aa-2T(b)(1), a 
reporting party shall report the pre-enactment security-based swap 
transaction by the compliance date established in the reporting rules 
required under Sections 3C(e) and 13A(a)(1) of the Exchange Act \18\ or 
within 60 days after a registered security-based swap data repository 
commences operations to receive and maintain data concerning such 
security-based swaps, whichever occurs first.\19\ The Commission 
believes it is appropriate to delay the reporting of such transaction 
information until the time detailed above because, until the 
registration rule is adopted and implemented, there will not be a 
registered security-based swap data repository able to accept security-
based swap data as required under the Dodd-Frank Act. Rule 13Aa-
2T(a)(4) defines a pre-enactment security-based swap transaction as a 
security-based swap that was entered into prior to, and that had not 
expired as of, July 21, 2010.\20\
---------------------------------------------------------------------------

    \17\ See Rule 13Aa-2T(b)(1). See infra Section II.B for a 
discussion of which counterparty has the reporting obligation.
    \18\ The Commission notes that Section 3C(e) of the Exchange Act 
requires that security-based swaps entered into before the date of 
enactment shall be reported no later than 180 days after the 
effective date of the section, i.e., January 12, 2012.
    \19\ See Rule 13Aa-2T(b)(1). The Commission notes that 
rulemaking regarding registered security-based swap repositories 
must be completed within 360 days after the date of enactment of the 
Dodd-Frank Act.
    \20\ See Rule 13Aa-2T(a)(4).
---------------------------------------------------------------------------

    In addition, pursuant to Rule 13Aa-2T(b)(2), a counterparty to a 
pre-enactment security-based swap transaction is required to report to 
the Commission upon request any information relating to these pre-
enactment security-based swap transactions during the time that the 
interim final temporary rule is in effect.\21\ The information that the 
Commission would request to be reported may vary depending upon the 
needs of the Commission, and may include actual trade data as well as 
summary trade data. Such summary data may include a description of the 
types of a security-based swap dealer's counterparties or types of 
reference entities, or the total number of pre-enactment security-based 
swap transactions entered into by the dealer and some measure of the 
frequency and duration of those contracts.\22\
---------------------------------------------------------------------------

    \21\ See infra Section II.B for a discussion of which 
counterparty has the reporting obligation.
    \22\ See infra Section II.D for a discussion of the treatment of 
post-enactment security-based swaps.
---------------------------------------------------------------------------

    The Commission anticipates that Rule 13Aa-2T(b) will facilitate the 
Commission's ability to understand and evaluate the current market for 
security-based swaps, and may inform the Commission's analysis of the 
other required rulemakings under the Dodd-Frank Act. In addition, 
information requested by the Commission may be used to facilitate other 
activities of the Commission, such as examinations.

B. Reporting Party

    Section 13A(a)(3) to the Exchange Act \23\ specifies the party 
obligated to report a security-based swap--either a security-based swap 
dealer, a major security-based swap participant, or a counterparty to 
the swap. These provisions apply for purposes of reporting pursuant to 
the interim final temporary rule.\24\ Specifically, Section 13A(a)(3) 
of the Exchange Act provides that with respect to a security-based swap 
in which only one counterparty is a security-based swap dealer or major 
security-based swap participant, the security-based swap dealer or 
major security-based swap participant shall report the security-based 
swap; with respect to a security-based swap in which one counterparty 
is a security-based swap dealer and the other counterparty is a major 
security-based swap participant, the security-based

[[Page 64646]]

swap dealer shall report the security-based swap; and with respect to 
any other security-based swap, the counterparties to the security-based 
swap shall select a counterparty to report the security-based swap.\25\
---------------------------------------------------------------------------

    \23\ 15 U.S.C. 78m-1(a)(3).
    \24\ See id.
    \25\ See id.
---------------------------------------------------------------------------

    Rule 13Aa-2T(c) incorporates these provisions. Specifically, Rule 
13Aa-2T(c) provides that where only one counterparty to a security-
based swap transaction is a security-based swap dealer or a major 
security-based swap participant, the security-based swap dealer or 
major security-based swap participant shall report the transaction; 
where one counterparty to a security-based swap transaction is a 
security-based swap dealer and the other counterparty is a major 
security-based swap participant, the security-based swap dealer shall 
report the transaction; and where neither counterparty to a security-
based swap transaction is security-based swap dealer or a major 
security-based swap participant, the counterparties to the transaction 
shall select the counterparty who will report the transaction.\26\
---------------------------------------------------------------------------

    \26\ See Rule 13Aa-2T(c).
---------------------------------------------------------------------------

C. Interpretive Note on Record Retention

    Pre-enactment security-based swaps that must be reported pursuant 
to Section 13A(a)(2) of the Exchange Act \27\ and new interim final 
temporary Rule 13Aa-2T thereunder have already occurred prior to 
enactment of the Dodd-Frank Act.\28\ Thus, to support the reporting 
requirements in Rule 13Aa-2T(b), a Note to paragraphs (b)(1) and (2) of 
Rule 13Aa-2T requires each counterparty to a pre-enactment security-
based swap transaction that may be required to report such transaction 
to retain information and documents relating to the terms of the 
transaction.\29\ Specifically, the Note requires a counterparty to a 
pre-enactment security-based swap transaction that may be required to 
report such transaction to retain in its existing format all 
information and documents, if available, to the extent and in such form 
as they currently exist, relating to the terms of the security-based 
swap transaction, including but not limited to: Any information 
necessary to identify and value the transaction; the date and time of 
execution of the transaction; all information from which the price of 
the transaction was derived; whether the transaction was accepted for 
clearing by any clearing agency or derivatives clearing organization, 
and, if so, the identity of such clearing agency or derivatives 
clearing organization; any modification(s) to the terms of the 
transaction; and the final confirmation of the transaction. The 
Commission believes that it is necessary for a counterparty that may be 
required to report such transaction to retain all information relating 
to the terms of pre-enactment security-based swaps in order for that 
counterparty to be able to comply with the reporting requirements of 
Rule 13Aa-2T. The specific information identified in the Note, as 
outlined above, is designed to encompass material information about 
pre-enactment security-based swap transactions that may be the subject 
of a request by the Commission to report pursuant to Rule 13Aa-
2T(b)(2), as well as the information required to be reported pursuant 
to Rule 13Aa-2T(b)(1). The Commission believes that the information 
identified above will provide the Commission with access to relevant 
information to help the Commission perform its oversight functions 
under the Federal securities laws.
---------------------------------------------------------------------------

    \27\ 15 U.S.C. 78m-1(a)(2).
    \28\ Pre-enactment security-based swaps are those security-based 
swaps that were entered into before July 21, 2010, the terms of 
which had not expired as of that date. See Section 13A(a)(2)(A).
    \29\ See Note to paragraphs (b)(1) and (2) of Rule 13Aa-2T.
---------------------------------------------------------------------------

    The time of execution of a security-based swap transaction is the 
point at which the parties become irrevocably bound under applicable 
law.\30\ For example, in the context of security-based swaps, an oral 
agreement over the phone will create an enforceable contract, and the 
time of execution will be when the parties to the telephone call agree 
to the material terms.\31\ The Commission also understands that the 
``price'' of a security-based swap may be expressed differently for 
different asset classes.
---------------------------------------------------------------------------

    \30\ The Commission understands that time of execution is not a 
data element that is consistently captured with respect to security-
based swap transactions.
    \31\ On the effective date of the Dodd-Frank Act, security-based 
swaps will be securities and the execution of the transaction will 
be the sale for Federal securities law purposes. For an explanation 
of when a sale occurs under the Securities Act of 1933 see 
Securities Act Release No. 8591 and Securities Exchange Act Release 
No. 52056 (July 19, 2005), 70 FR 44722 (August 3, 2005), notes 391 
and 394.
---------------------------------------------------------------------------

    The Commission envisions that documentation retained pursuant to 
the need to preserve all information from which the price of the 
transaction was derived should reflect all information necessary to 
determine the price including, among other things, the quoting 
convention (for example, the economic spread, which is variously 
referred to as the traded spread, quote spread or composite spread, 
expressed as a number of basis points per annum, for CDS 
transactions,\32\ or the LIBOR-based Floating Rate Payment, expressed 
as a floating rate plus a fixed number of basis points multiplied by 
the notional amount, for equity or loan total return swaps).
---------------------------------------------------------------------------

    \32\ Dealers quote prices for entering into credit default swaps 
as a fixed number of basis points per annum they require to be paid 
(if they are quoting to sell protection) or that they are willing to 
pay (if they are quoting to buy protection). This number is 
variously referred to as the ``running spread,'' ``quoted spread'' 
or ``traded spread.'' It will be higher to sell protection than to 
buy protection, allowing the dealer to earn a profit on offsetting 
transactions for the same reference entity--e.g., 510 basis points 
bid, 530 basis points asked.
    On execution, the running spread is converted, using a standard, 
publicly available, industry-accepted formula, into an upfront 
payment plus a standardized coupon--generally 100 basis points for 
investment grade reference entities, and 500 basis points for high 
yield reference entities. This conversion does not affect the market 
value or economics of the transaction, and is done simply to make 
CDS more fungible, which makes them easier to clear, among other 
benefits. Because of this conversion, the running spread itself does 
not appear in the terms of the contract, but is replaced by its 
economic equivalent.
---------------------------------------------------------------------------

    The interpretation to retain information does not require any 
counterparty to a pre-enactment security-based swap transaction that 
may be required to report such transaction to create new records with 
respect to transactions that occurred in the past. By allowing such 
records to be retained in their existing format, the interpretation is 
designed to assure that important information relating to the terms of 
pre-enactment security-based swap transactions is preserved without 
unnecessary burden on the counterparties. Likewise, to the extent that 
any information required to be retained pursuant to the Note and 
reported pursuant to Rule 13Aa-2T(b)(1) or (b)(2) is not information 
that the counterparty already has prior to the effective date of this 
proposal, such as the time of execution, the Commission understands 
that such information could not be retained pursuant to the Note or 
reported pursuant to Rule 13Aa-2T(b)(1) or (b)(2).

D. Post-Enactment Security-Based Swaps

    As noted above, Rule 13Aa-2T applies solely to security-based swap 
transactions entered into before July 21, 2010, the terms of which had 
not expired as of that date, and thus does not cover security-based 
swap transactions entered into on or after July 21, 2010. The Dodd-
Frank Act, however, also requires the Commission to adopt reporting 
rules covering such post-enactment security-based swaps.

[[Page 64647]]

Specifically, Section 3C(e)(2) of the Exchange Act requires the 
reporting of security-based swaps entered into on or after such date of 
enactment to a registered security-based swap data repository or the 
Commission no later than the later of: (A) 90 days after such effective 
date; or (B) such other time after entering into the security-based 
swap as the Commission may prescribe by rule or regulation.\33\ In 
addition, Section 13A(a)(1) of the Exchange Act requires that each 
security-based swap that is not accepted for clearing by any clearing 
agency or derivatives clearing organization shall be reported to: (A) A 
security-based swap data repository described in Section 13(n) of the 
Exchange Act; or (B) in the case in which there is no security-based 
swap data repository that would accept the security-based swap, to the 
Commission within such time period as the Commission may by rule or 
regulation prescribe.\34\ The Commission is directed to adopt rules 
under Sections 3C(e) and 13A(a) within 360 days of the enactment of the 
Dodd-Frank Act.\35\ Parties to security-based swaps could be required 
under those rules, if adopted, to report information relating to such 
transactions. In that regard, counterparties could be expected to have 
access to similar information in order to report post-enactment 
security-based swaps.
---------------------------------------------------------------------------

    \33\ See 15 U.S.C. 78c-3(e)(2). Section 3(C)(e)(1) also states 
that security-based swaps entered into before the date of the 
enactment of this section shall be reported to a registered 
security-based swap data repository or the Commission no later than 
180 days after the effective date of that section.
    \34\ See 15 U.S.C. 78m-1(a)(1).
    \35\ See Sections 763(a) and 766(a) of the Dodd-Frank Act.
---------------------------------------------------------------------------

E. Effective Date

    Rule 13Aa-2T will be effective as of October 20, 2010 and will 
remain in effect until the operative date of the permanent 
recordkeeping and reporting rules for security-based swap transactions 
to be adopted by the Commission or January 12, 2012, whichever occurs 
first.\36\ The Commission believes it is appropriate to make the rule 
effective upon publication in the Federal Register since the rule 
applies to information parties to pre-enactment security-based swaps 
would already have in their possession. In addition, this would provide 
the Commission the ability to request information on such pre-enactment 
security-based swaps immediately. Further, the Commission believes the 
proposed sunset date is appropriate because it will allow the rule to 
remain in effect until a permanent rule relating to the reporting of 
pre-enactment security-based swaps has become effective and operative, 
or until the date by which Section 3C of the Exchange Act requires 
security-based swaps entered into before the date of enactment of the 
Dodd-Frank Act to be reported to a registered security-based data 
repository or the Commission.\37\

---------------------------------------------------------------------------

III. Request for Comment

    We are requesting comments from all members of the public. We will 
carefully consider the comments that we receive. We seek comment 
generally on all aspects of the interim final temporary rule. In 
addition, we seek comment on the following:
    1. Should the Commission clarify or modify any of the definitions 
included in Rule 13Aa-2T? If so, which definitions and what specific 
modifications are appropriate or necessary?
    2. The Commission seeks public comment on what specific information 
is necessary to derive the ``price'' of a security-based swap 
transaction. In other words, what specific information is needed for a 
third party to value the transaction? How do these data elements vary 
depending on the type or class of security-based swap? Do current 
quoting conventions across classes and types of securities-based swaps 
provide sufficient information from which to derive transaction prices?
    3. Is there an industry standard format for information and records 
regarding security-based swaps? Are there different standard formats 
depending on the type or class of security-based swap? Please answer 
with specificity.
    4. Rule 13Aa-2T(c) details which counterparty to a security-based 
swap transaction has the reporting obligation. In cases where 
counterparties must select which counterparty will report the 
transaction, is additional Commission guidance necessary or desirable? 
Is there a mechanism to allocate the reporting obligation that the 
Commission should implement in such cases?
    5. The Note to paragraphs (b)(1) and (2) of Rule 13Aa-2T provides 
that counterparties shall retain, in their existing format, all 
information and documents relating to the terms of a pre-enactment 
security-based swap transaction, including but not limited to certain 
specified data elements. What documents and data typically are kept by 
security-based swap market participants to memorialize their 
transactions? What documents and data typically are kept to memorialize 
post-trade events such as novations, assignments, terminations and 
other events? In what format? How long are such records currently 
maintained by market participants? How often do market participants 
record the time of execution of a security-based swap?
    6. The Commission requests comment on its interpretation of the 
types of documents and data needed to be retained in order to satisfy 
reporting required by the Note to paragraphs (b)(1) and (2) of Rule 
13Aa-2T. What additional information, if any, should be retained and 
what burdens or costs would the retention of such information entail? 
What information and documents, if any, are not needed to be retained 
while still providing for an understanding of the material terms of a 
security-based swap?
    7. What are the technological or administrative burdens of 
maintaining the information specified in the Note to paragraphs (b)(1) 
and (2) of Rule 13Aa-2T?
    8. The Commission requests comment on the information that is 
required to be reported pursuant to Rule 13Aa-2T(b)(1). What additional 
information, if any, should be reported?
    9. Rule 13Aa-2T is a temporary rule and is set to expire no later 
than January 12, 2012. Should we remove the expiration provision of the 
rule and make the rule permanent? Should we extend the expiration date 
of the rule? If so, for how long? Should we allow the rule to expire?
    Title VII of the Dodd-Frank Act requires that the Commission 
consult and coordinate to the extent possible with the CFTC for the 
purposes of assuring regulatory consistency and comparability, to the 
extent possible,\38\ and states that in adopting rules, the CFTC and 
Commission shall treat functionally or economically similar products or 
entities in a similar manner.\39\
---------------------------------------------------------------------------

    \38\ Section 712(a)(2) of the Dodd-Frank Act.
    \39\ Section 712(a)(7) of the Dodd-Frank Act.
---------------------------------------------------------------------------

    The CFTC has adopted rules related to the reporting of swaps 
entered into before July 21, 2010, the terms of which had not expired 
as of that date (``pre-enactment swaps'') as required under Section 729 
of the Dodd-Frank Act. Understanding that the Commission and the CFTC 
regulate different products and markets, and as such, appropriately may 
be proposing alternative regulatory requirements, we request comments 
on the impact of any differences between the Commission and CFTC 
approaches to the regulation of pre-enactment security-based swaps and 
pre-enactment

[[Page 64648]]

swaps. Specifically, do the regulatory approaches under the 
Commission's proposed rulemaking pursuant to Section 766 of the Dodd-
Frank Act and the CFTC's proposed rulemaking pursuant to Section 729 of 
the Dodd-Frank Act result in duplicative or inconsistent efforts on the 
part of market participants subject to both regulatory regimes or 
result in gaps between those regimes? If so, in what ways do commenters 
believe that such duplication, inconsistencies, or gaps should be 
minimized? Do commenters believe the approaches proposed by the 
Commission and the CFTC to regulate pre-enactment security-based swaps 
and pre-enactment swaps are comparable? If not, why? Do commenters 
believe there are approaches that would make the regulation of pre-
enactment security-based swaps and pre-enactment swaps more comparable? 
If so,what? Do commenters believe that it would be appropriate for us 
to adopt an approach proposed by the CFTC that differs from our 
proposal? If so, which one? We request commenters to provide data, to 
the extent possible, supporting any such suggested approaches.

IV. Other Matters

    The Administrative Procedure Act generally requires an agency to 
publish notice of a proposed rulemaking in the Federal Register.\40\ 
This requirement does not apply, however, if the agency ``for good 
cause finds * * * that notice and public procedure are impracticable, 
unnecessary, or contrary to the public interest.'' \41\ Further, the 
Administrative Procedure Act also generally requires that an agency 
publish an adopted rule in the Federal Register 30 days before it 
becomes effective.\42\ This requirement, however, does not apply if the 
agency finds good cause for making the rule effective sooner.\43\ The 
Commission, for good cause, finds that notice and solicitation of 
comment before the effective date of Rule 13Aa-2T is impracticable, 
unnecessary, or contrary to the public interest.\44\ Section 766 of the 
Dodd-Frank Act amended the Exchange Act to add a new Section 13A. 
Section 13A(a)(2)(B) requires the Commission to adopt, within 90 days 
of enactment of the Dodd-Frank Act, an interim final rule providing for 
the reporting of each security-based swap entered into before the date 
of enactment of the Dodd-Frank Act the terms of which were not expired 
as of that date.\45\ The Commission is adopting Rule 13Aa-2T to fulfill 
this requirement.

    \44\ This finding also satisfies the requirements of 5 U.S.C. 
808(2), allowing the rules to become effective notwithstanding the 
requirement of 5 U.S.C. 801 (if a Federal agency finds that notice 
and public comment are ``impractical, unnecessary or contrary to the 
public interest,'' a rule ``shall take effect at such time as the 
Federal agency promulgating the rule determines.'').

V. Paperwork Reduction Act

    Certain provisions of Rule 13Aa-2T contain ``collection of 
information requirements'' within the meaning of the Paperwork 
Reduction Act of 1995 (``PRA'').\46\ The Commission has submitted the 
information to the Office of Management and Budget (``OMB'') for review 
in accordance with 44 U.S.C. 3507 and 5 CFR 1320.11. An agency may not 
conduct or sponsor, and a person is not required to respond to, a 
collection of information unless it displays a currently valid control 
number. The title of this collection is ``Rule 13Aa-2T--Reporting of 
Pre-Enactment Security-Based Swap Transactions.'' We are applying for a 
new OMB Control Number for this collection in accordance with 44 U.S.C. 
3507(j) and 5 CFR 1320.13.
---------------------------------------------------------------------------

    \46\ 44 U.S.C. 3501 et seq.
---------------------------------------------------------------------------

1. Summary of Collection of Information

    As required under Section 13A of the Exchange Act, as provided by 
Section 766 of the Dodd-Frank Act, the Commission is adopting new Rule 
13Aa-2T governing the reporting requirements applicable to security-
based swap transactions entered into before July 21, 2010, the terms of 
which have not expired as of that date, i.e., pre-enactment security-
based swap transactions. Rule 13Aa-2T, by its terms, mandates three 
separate data collections for entities covered by the rule. The 
Commission believes that new Rule 13Aa-2T will impact more than 10 
entities and thus meets the definition of a collection of information 
under the PRA.
    First, pursuant to Rule 13Aa-2T(b)(1), pre-enactment security-based 
swap transactions must be reported to a registered security-based swap 
data repository or the Commission by the compliance date established in 
the reporting rules required under Sections 3C(e) and 13A(a)(1) of the 
Exchange Act, or within 60 days after a registered security-based swap 
data repository commences operations to receive and maintain data 
concerning such security-based swaps, whichever occurs first.\47\ The 
rule specifies that the transaction report shall include a copy of the 
transaction confirmation, in electronic form, if available, or in 
written form, if there is no electronic copy, and the time, if 
available, the transaction was executed.\48\
---------------------------------------------------------------------------

    \47\ See Rule 13Aa-2T(b)(1).
    \48\ Id.
---------------------------------------------------------------------------

    Second, Rule 13Aa-2T(b)(2) requires reporting to the Commission 
upon request of any information relating to pre-enactment security-
based swap-transactions.\49\ Finally, the Note to paragraphs (b)(1) and 
(2) of Rule 13Aa-2T requires each counterparty to a pre-enactment 
security-based swap transaction that may be required to report such 
transaction to retain, in its existing format, all information and 
documents, if available, to the extent and in such form as they 
currently exist, relating to the terms of pre-enactment security-based 
swap transactions.\50\ The rule specifies that such information shall 
include, without limitation: Any information needed to identify and 
value the transaction; the time, if available, of execution of the 
transaction; all information from which the price of the transaction 
was derived; whether the transaction was accepted for clearing by any 
clearing agency or derivatives clearing organization, and, if so, the 
identity of such clearing agency or derivatives clearing organization; 
any modification(s) to the terms of the transaction; and the final 
confirmation of the transaction.\51\
---------------------------------------------------------------------------

    \49\ See Rule 13Aa-2T(b)(2).
    \50\ See Note to paragraphs (b)(1) and (2) of Rule 13Aa-2T.
    \51\ Id.
---------------------------------------------------------------------------

2. Proposed Use of Information

    The rule makes information available to the Commission that can 
provide insight into the size and operation of the OTC derivatives 
market.\52\ The information will provide a starting benchmark against 
which to assess the development of the security-based swap market over 
time. The information collected pursuant to Rule 13Aa-2T also will 
provide the Commission information to assist with its analysis of the 
permanent reporting and other rules required by the Dodd-Frank Act. 
Information related to pre-enactment security-based swap transactions 
may also be used by the Commission to assess activities and risks in 
the security-based swap markets or securities markets more generally. 
Requiring such information be reported

[[Page 64649]]

also should facilitate general market oversight.
---------------------------------------------------------------------------

    \52\ For example, the information collected could provide the 
Commission with insight as to the size (in notional value), number 
of transactions, and number and type of participants of the 
security-based swap market.
---------------------------------------------------------------------------

3. Respondents

    Rule 13Aa-2T requires reporting of all security-based swaps entered 
into prior to July 21, 2010, the terms of which have not expired as of 
that date. The rule thus will cover security-based swap dealers, major 
security-based swap participants, each defined in Section 3(a) of the 
Exchange Act, and other counterparties when there is no security-based 
swap dealer or major security-based swap participant involved in the 
pre-enactment security-based swap transaction.\53\
---------------------------------------------------------------------------

    \53\ See 15 U.S.C. 78c(a)(68) and (71).
---------------------------------------------------------------------------

    The Commission does not know the exact number of security-based 
swap market participants. Based on the information currently available 
to the Commission, there are roughly 1,000 entities regularly engaged 
in the CDS marketplace, consisting primarily of banks, hedge funds, and 
asset managers. The Commission believes that most of these same 
entities would likely also participate in other security-based swap 
markets and that few, if any, other entities engage in security-based 
swaps that are not CDSs. Accordingly, the Commission preliminarily 
believes that it is reasonable to use the figure of 1,000 potential 
respondents covered by Rule 13Aa-2T for purposes of estimating 
collection of information burdens under the PRA.
    The Commission seeks comment on what entities may be subject to 
Rule 13Aa-2T, whether specific classes of entities may be impacted, how 
many entities may be impacted, and whether any such entity or class of 
entities may be impacted differently than others under the rule. The 
Commission seeks comment on the accuracy of its estimates as to the 
number of participants in the security-based swap market that will be 
required to report information pursuant to Rule 13Aa-2T.

4. Total Initial and Annual Reporting and Recordkeeping Burdens

    As described above, pursuant to Rule 13Aa-2T(b)(1), pre-enactment 
security-based swap transactions must be reported to a registered 
security-based swap data repository or the Commission by the compliance 
date established in the reporting rules required under Sections 3C(e) 
and 13A(a)(1) of the Exchange Act, or within 60 days after a registered 
security-based swap data repository commences operations to receive and 
maintain data concerning such security-based swaps, whichever occurs 
first. Additionally, Rule 13Aa-2T(b)(2) requires reporting to the 
Commission upon request of any information relating to pre-enactment 
security-based swap-transactions. Finally, the Note to paragraphs 
(b)(1) and (2) of Rule 13Aa-2T requires each counterparty to a pre-
enactment security-based swap transaction that may be required to 
report such transaction to retain, in its existing format, all 
information and documents, if available, to the extent and in such form 
as they currently exist, relating to the terms of pre-enactment 
security-based swap transactions.
    Although a new obligation, the Commission does not believe that 
Rule 13Aa-2T will require covered entities to materially change their 
current practices or operations with respect to recordkeeping for pre-
enactment security-based swap transactions. The Commission believes 
that any counterparty to a pre-enactment security-based swap 
transaction that may be required to report such transaction, as part of 
its regular business operations, would already maintain records of any 
such transactions, and that such records likely include the minimum 
information set out in the Note to paragraphs (b)(1) and (2) of Rule 
13Aa-2T. Nonetheless, our interpretation that counterparties must 
retain information relating to the terms of pre-enactment security-
based swaps in order to be able to satisfy their reporting obligation 
is a new burden. Entities subject to the rule may have to implement new 
document retention and reporting policies.\54\
---------------------------------------------------------------------------

    \54\ The Commission expects to issue permanent rules regarding 
the retention and reporting of information about the terms of 
security-based swaps within the next year in compliance with the 
Dodd-Frank Act. Any PRA burden contained in those rules will be 
taken into account in those rulemakings.
---------------------------------------------------------------------------

    Based on publicly available information and consultation with 
industry sources, the Commission estimates there were approximately 2 
million CDS contracts outstanding on the date of enactment.\55\ The 
Commission believes that CDS transactions represent the majority of 
security-based swap transactions. The Commission preliminarily 
estimates that CDS transactions represent approximately 85 percent of 
all security-based swap transactions open on the date of enactment of 
the Dodd-Frank Act.\56\ Accordingly, the total number of security-based 
swap transactions subject to Rule 13Aa-2T would be approximately 
2,400,000.
---------------------------------------------------------------------------

    \55\ See, e.g., <A HREF="http://frwebgate.access.gpo.gov/cgi-bin/leaving.cgi?from=leavingFR.html&log=linklog&to=http://www.dtcc.com/products/derivserv/data_table_i.php">http://www.dtcc.com/products/derivserv/data_
table_i.php</A> (data as of July 23, 2010).
    \56\ The Commission's estimate is based on internal analysis of 
available security-based swap market data. The Commission is seeking 
comment about the overall size of the security-based swap market, 
and as discussed in this release, believes that Rule 13Aa-2T will, 
among other things, provide insight about the number of pre-
enactment security-based swaps and the overall size of the security-
based swap market.
---------------------------------------------------------------------------

    The Commission preliminarily estimates that the requirement to 
retain information and documents pursuant to the Note to paragraphs 
(b)(1) and (2) of Rule 13Aa-2T would impose a burden on each respondent 
of approximately 38 burden hours for an aggregate burden of 
approximately 38,000 hours, which includes an estimate of the number of 
potential burden hours required to amend internal procedures, reprogram 
systems, and implement compliance processes to ensure that pre-
enactment security-based swap transaction data is preserved.\57\
---------------------------------------------------------------------------

    \57\ This figure is based on discussions with various market 
participants. It is based on the following: [((Sr. Programmer at 2 
hours) + (Sr. Systems Analyst at 4 hours) + (Compliance Manager at 5 
hours) + (Compliance Clerk at 20 hours) + (Director of Compliance at 
2 hours) + (Compliance Attorney at 5 hours)) x (1,000 reporting 
entities)] = 38,000 burden hours, which is 38 hours per reporting 
entity. As noted, the Commission preliminarily believes that, given 
the current nature of the records to be retained, information on 
security-based swap transactions is currently being retained by 
market participants in the ordinary course of business, and as a 
practical matter should not result in any significant new burdens. 
Because the Commission expects to adopt permanent reporting rules 
within one year, the Commission does not believe that Rule 13Aa-2T 
will generate any ongoing burdens beyond the first 12 months. 
Accordingly, our estimates do not distinguish initial and ongoing 
burdens.
---------------------------------------------------------------------------

    Rule 13Aa-2T(b)(1) requires reporting entities to report pre-
enactment security-based swap transactions to a registered security-
based swap data repository or the Commission by the compliance date 
established in the reporting rules required under Sections 3C(e) and 
13A(a)(1) of the Exchange Act, or within 60 days after a registered 
security-based swap data repository commences operations to receive and 
maintain data concerning such security-based swaps, whichever occurs 
first. Reporting entities may have initial costs to establish 
connectivity with and report the pre-enactment security-based swaps to 
a registered security-based swap data repository or the Commission. The 
Commission preliminarily estimates that the cost to establish 
connectivity to a security-based swap data repository to facilitate the 
reporting required by Rule 13Aa-2T(b)(1) would impose a burden on each 
respondent of approximately $25,000, for an aggregate burden of 
approximately $25,000,000.\58\ In

[[Page 64650]]

addition, the Commission preliminarily estimates that complying with 
Rule 13Aa-2T(b)(1) would impose a burden on each respondent of 
approximately 480 hours, for an aggregate burden of approximately 
480,000 burden hours.\59\
---------------------------------------------------------------------------

    \58\ This estimate is based on discussions of Commission staff 
with various market participants, as well as the Commission's 
experience regarding connectivity between securities market 
participants, including alternative trading systems and self-
regulatory organizations for data reporting purposes. The Commission 
derived the total estimated expense from the following: ($25,000 
relating to hardware- and software-related expenses) x (1,000 
reporting entities) = $25,000,000. It is the Commission's 
understanding that many reporting entities already have established 
linkages to entities that may register as security-based swap data 
repositories, which may impact the out-of-pocket costs associated 
with Rule 13Aa-2T(b)(1).
    \59\ This figure is based on discussions of Commission staff 
with various market participants, as well as the Commissions 
experience regarding connectivity between securities market 
participants, including alternative trading systems and self-
regulatory organizations for data reporting purposes. The Commission 
derived the total estimated one-time burden from the following: 
[(2,400,000 estimated total pre-enactment securities-based swap 
transactions) x (75 percent automated, electronic reporting) x (0.1 
hours/transaction)] + [2,400,000 estimated total pre-enactment 
securities-based swap transactions) x (25 percent manual, electronic 
reporting) x (Compliance Clerk 0.5 hours/transaction)] = 480,000 
burden hours, which is 480 burden hours per respondent. Because the 
Commission expects to adopt permanent reporting rules within one 
year, the Commission does not believe that Rule 13Aa-2T will 
generate any ongoing burdens beyond the first 12 months. 
Accordingly, our estimates do not distinguish initial and ongoing 
burdens.
---------------------------------------------------------------------------

    Rule 13Aa-2T(b)(2) requires reporting entities to report to the 
Commission upon request any information relating to pre-enactment 
security-based swap transactions. Because the Note to paragraphs (b)(1) 
and (2) of Rule 13Aa-2T(d) requires reporting entities to retain their 
documents and information relating to the terms of pre-enactment 
security-based swap transactions, the Commission preliminarily believes 
that responding to a Commission request for such information should not 
impose a significant additional burden on reporting entities. A 
reporting entity would need to review the request and gather responsive 
transaction data and documents. Assuming the Commission requested one 
report from each reporting entity,\60\ the Commission preliminarily 
estimates that responding to Commission requests for information and 
documents pursuant to Rule 13Aa-2T(b)(2) would impose a burden on each 
respondent of approximately 34 hours, for an aggregate burden of 
approximately 34,000 burden hours.\61\
---------------------------------------------------------------------------

    \60\ The Commission preliminarily believes it would not request 
reports from every reporting entity. However, for purposes of 
estimating the burden, the Commission is assuming it would request 
one report from each reporting entity.
    \61\ This figure is based on discussions with various market 
participants. It is based on the following: [(Compliance Manager at 
5 hours) + (Compliance Attorney at 5 hours) + (Programmer Analyst at 
1 hour) + (Compliance Clerk at 15 hours) + (Director of Compliance 
at 3 hours) + (Sr. Database Administrator at 5 hours)] x (1,000 
reporting entities) = 34,000 burden hours, which is 34 hours per 
reporting entity.
---------------------------------------------------------------------------

    The Commission seeks comment on the recordkeeping and reporting 
collection of information burdens associated with Rule 13Aa-2T. In 
particular, what burdens, if any, will respondents incur with respect 
to system design, programming, expanding systems capacity, and 
establishing compliance programs to comply with Rule 13Aa-2T? Will 
there be different or additional burdens associated with the collection 
of information under Rule 13Aa-2T that a covered entity does not 
currently undertake in the ordinary course of business that we have not 
identified?

5. Retention Period of Recordkeeping Requirements

    A covered entity will be required by Rule 13Aa-2T to retain records 
and information only until such information has been reported to a 
registered security-based swap data repository or the Commission.\62\ 
Rule 13Aa-2T(b)(1) provides that the reporting shall occur by the 
compliance date established in the reporting rules required under 
Sections 3C(e) and 13A(a)(1) of the Exchange Act, or within 60 days 
after a registered security-based swap data repository commences 
operations to receive and maintain data concerning such security-based 
swaps, whichever occurs first.
---------------------------------------------------------------------------

    \62\ The Commission notes that a respondent may well be subject 
to additional record retention burdens for pre-enactment security-
based swaps pursuant to rules to be adopted by the Commission 
pursuant to Section 3C(e) of the Exchange Act.
---------------------------------------------------------------------------

6. Collection of Information Is Mandatory

    Any collection of information pursuant to Rule 13Aa-2T will be a 
mandatory collection of information to permit the Commission to collect 
accurate information about security-based swap transactions entered 
into prior to, and not expired as of, the date of enactment of the 
Dodd-Frank Act.

7. Responses to Collection of Information May Not Be Confidential

    Other than information for which a reporting entity requests 
confidential treatment and that may be withheld from the public in 
accordance with the provisions of 5 U.S.C. 522 (The Freedom of 
Information Act (``FOIA'')), the collection of information pursuant to 
Rule 13Aa-2T will not be kept confidential and will be publicly 
available. Among other things, FOIA recognizes the confidentiality of 
commercial information under two exemptions. First, FOIA Exemption 4 
provides an exemption for ``trade secrets and commercial or financial 
information obtained from a person and privileged or confidential.'' 
\63\ Second, FOIA Exemption 8 provides an exemption for matters that 
are ``contained in or related to examination, operating, or condition 
reports prepared by, on behalf of, or for the use of an agency 
responsible for the regulation or supervision of financial 
institutions.'' \64\ The Commission will carefully consider any 
requests for confidential treatment under either of these exemptions or 
under other exemptions contained in 5 U.S.C. 522.
---------------------------------------------------------------------------

    \63\ See 5 U.S.C. 552(b)(4).
    \64\ See 5 U.S.C. 552(b)(8).
---------------------------------------------------------------------------

8. Request for Comment

    Pursuant to 44 U.S.C. 3505(c)(2)(B), the Commission solicits 
comment to:
    1. Evaluate whether the proposed collection of information is 
necessary for the performance of the functions of the agency, including 
whether the information shall have practical utility;
    2. Evaluate the accuracy of the agency's estimate of the burden of 
the proposed collection of information;
    3. Enhance the quality, utility, and clarity of the information to 
be collected; and
    4. Minimize the burden of collection of information on those who 
are to respond, including through the use of automated collection 
techniques or other forms of information technology.

VI. Cost-Benefit Analysis

    Earlier this year, Congress passed the Dodd-Frank Act. The far-
reaching legislation was a response to the recent financial crisis. 
Among other things, it is designed to strengthen oversight, improve 
consumer protections, and reduce systemic risks throughout the 
financial system.\65\ Title VII of the Dodd-Frank Act specifically 
addresses the OTC derivatives markets, including the market for 
security-based swaps. The swap markets have been described as being 
opaque.\66\ Transaction-level

[[Page 64651]]

data is not publicly available. A major source of information is the 
semi-annual survey conducted by the Bank of International Settlements 
(``BIS'') on the volume of swaps transaction by major categories of 
swaps.\67\ One of the purposes of the Dodd-Frank Act is to improve the 
transparency of the OTC derivatives market.\68\
---------------------------------------------------------------------------

    \65\ See H.R. Rep. No. 111-517, at 865 (2010). See, e.g., 156 
Cong. Rec. S5878 (July 15, 2010) and 156 Cong. Rec. S5882 (July 15, 
2010).
    \66\ With respect to CDS, for example, the Government 
Accountability Office found that ``comprehensive and consistent data 
on the overall market have not been readily available,'' that 
``authoritative information about the actual size of the CDS market 
is generally not available,'' and that regulators currently are 
unable ``to monitor activities across the market.'' Government

Derivatives Dealers' Club and Derivatives Market Reform,'' Brookings 
Institution (April 7, 2010) at 15-20. See also Michael Mackenzie, 
June 25, 2010, Era of an opaque swaps market ends, Fin. Times, June

    \67\ The BIS semi-annual report on the swap markets summarizes 
developments in the OTC derivatives markets during the relevant 
period. The report breaks down trading volumes and other statistics 
for various classes of derivatives, including credit default swaps, 
interest rate and foreign exchange derivatives, and equity and 
commodity derivatives. The report covers derivatives trading within 
the G10 countries. The most recent report, available at <A HREF="http://frwebgate.access.gpo.gov/cgi-bin/leaving.cgi?from=leavingFR.html&log=linklog&to=http://www.bis.org/statistics/derstats.htm">http://

last quarter of 2009.
    \68\ See, e.g., 156 Cong. Rec. S5879 (July 15, 2010) and 156 
Cong. Rec. H5252 (June 30, 2010).
---------------------------------------------------------------------------

    Title VII requires the Commission to undertake a large number of 
rulemakings to implement the regulatory framework for security-based 
swaps that is set forth in the Dodd-Frank Act, including the reporting 
of security-based swap transactions. The interim final temporary rule 
being issued today is the first step in that process and is designed to 
provide for reporting of pre-enactment security-based swaps in the 
framework set up by the Dodd-Frank Act. The rule will provide the 
Commission the ability to obtain data on pre-enactment security-based 
swaps. Rule 13Aa-2T also will provide for the preservation of data on 
pre-enactment security-based swaps until the Commission issues 
permanent recordkeeping and reporting rules for all security-based 
swaps. By making records available to the Commission, Rule 13Aa-2T will 
enable the Commission to begin its review of the size and scope of the 
security-based swap marketplace. Today's action is designed to 
ultimately lead to a more robust, transparent environment for the 
market for security-based swaps.
    The Commission is sensitive to the costs and benefits associated 
with Rule 13Aa-2T. The Commission requests comment on the costs and 
benefits associated with the rule, and its cost-benefit analysis, 
including identification and assessments of any costs and benefits not 
discussed in this analysis. The Commission also seeks comments on the 
accuracy of any of the benefits identified and also welcomes comments 
on the accuracy of any of the cost estimates. Finally, the Commission 
encourages commenters to identify, discuss, analyze, and supply 
relevant data, information, or statistics regarding any such costs or 
benefits.

A. Benefits

    Rule 13Aa-2T, which is being adopted as required by the Dodd-Frank 
Act, will provide a means for the Commission to gain a better 
understanding of the security-based swap markets, including the size 
and scope of that market, by making available transaction data on pre-
enactment security-based swaps. In addition, having such data available 
should help Commission staff to analyze the security-based swap market 
as a whole and identify risks. In this way, Rule 13Aa-2T will support 
the Commission's supervisory function over the security-based swap 
markets as required by Congress in the Dodd-Frank Act. Further, the 
rule should make available information to the Commission that could 
inform its decision-making with respect to the rules that it is 
required to implement under the Dodd-Frank Act. Rule 13Aa-2T also could 
facilitate the reports the Commission is required to provide to 
Congress on security-based swaps and the security-based swaps 
marketplace.\69\
---------------------------------------------------------------------------

    \69\ See Section 719 of the Dodd-Frank Act.
---------------------------------------------------------------------------

    Further, Rule 13Aa-2T will require market participants to inventory 
their positions in swaps to determine what information needs to be 
retained and reported. Potentially, this may encourage management 
review of internal procedures and controls by those market 
participants.
    The Commission's rules on reporting pre-enactment security-based 
swap transaction data also may have benefits to the OTC derivatives 
market. For example, the introduction of the Trade Reporting and 
Compliance Engine (TRACE) system helped substantially increase the 
transparency of, and decrease transaction costs in, the bond 
market.\70\ This interim final temporary rule represents a first step 
toward a more transparent market for security-based swaps. Market 
participants also will be able to begin planning how security-based 
swap data can be maintained, consolidated, and reported in anticipation 
of permanent rules to be issued by the Commission pursuant to the 
requirements set forth in the Dodd-Frank Act. The initial experience in 
the context of Rule 13Aa-2T may help market participants and the 
Commission assess alternatives for permanent security-based swap 
transaction reporting requirements.

---------------------------------------------------------------------------

B. Costs

    The Note to paragraphs (b)(1) and (2) of Rule 13Aa-2T requires the 
retention of records relating to security-based swap transactions 
entered into before July 21, 2010, the terms of which had not expired 
as of that date. Although there are recordkeeping costs associated with 
the retention of existing pre-enactment security-based swap transaction 
information, the Commission preliminarily does not believe that they 
will be significant. The information that is required to be reported 
pursuant to Rule 13Aa-2T(b)(1)(i)--a copy of the transaction 
confirmation--should be information that respondents already keep in 
their normal course of business. In addition, that information can be 
reported in the form in which it is kept, either electronic or written 
form. Further, respondents must report the time of execution pursuant 
to Rule 13Aa-2T(b)(1)(ii) only to the extent that the information is 
available.
    The Commission preliminarily estimates that the interim final 
temporary rule could affect more than 1,000 market participants and 
cover approximately 2.4 million security-based swap transactions, 
although identification of the exact number of respondents and covered 
transactions is impossible to determine at this time.\71\ As stated 
above, however, the Commission preliminarily believes that information 
about open security-based swap transactions should already be 
maintained by covered entities as part of their day-to-day operations. 
Further, the rule does not require market participants to modify the 
data that they have for retention purposes. Rule 13Aa-2T requires only 
that parties retain records of the terms of the transactions in the 
form and to the extent that they already exist; parties are not 
required retroactively to supplement or otherwise alter transaction 
information.
---------------------------------------------------------------------------

    \71\ See supra Section V.
---------------------------------------------------------------------------

    The Commission recognizes that the permanent reporting rules that 
it is required to adopt under Section 3C(e) of the Exchange Act also 
will apply to pre-enactment security-based swaps. Therefore, in 
adopting Rule 13Aa-2T, the Commission sought to limit the burden on 
potential respondents by not imposing substantial and potentially 
conflicting affirmative reporting requirements that would require 
respondents to make system and other changes that may be different from 
the

[[Page 64652]]

changes they will need to make pursuant to the permanent reporting 
rules.\72\
---------------------------------------------------------------------------

    \72\ The Commission believes that it is practical to require 
this reporting after rules for registration of security-based data 
repositories are in place, to allow the choice of reporting to an 
entity that has experience receiving this type of information. The 
Commission will have access to the data it determines is most useful 
for understanding and analyzing the market for security-based swaps 
as it develops final reporting and other rules required under the 
Dodd-Frank Act by being able to require information to be reported 
upon request to the Commission under Rule 13Aa-2T(b)(2).
---------------------------------------------------------------------------

    The Commission preliminarily estimates that amending internal 
procedures, reprogramming systems, and implementing compliance 
processes to ensure that pre-enactment security-based swap transaction 
data is preserved pursuant to the Note to paragraphs (b)(1) and (2) of 
Rule 13Aa-2T could result in a cost to each respondent of approximately 
$6,236 and an aggregate cost of approximately $6,236,000.\73\ The 
Commission preliminarily does not believe that there will be additional 
costs attributable to the record retention requirements of Rule 13Aa-2T 
beyond the initial cost of ensuring that such records are maintained.
---------------------------------------------------------------------------

    \73\ This figure is based on discussions with various market 
participants. The Commission derived the total estimated initial 
annualized expense from the following: ((Sr. Programmer (2 hours) at 
$292 per hour + (Sr. Systems Analyst (4 hours) at $244 per hour) + 
(Compliance Manager (5 hours) at $258 per hour) + (Compliance Clerk 
(20 hours) at $63 per hour) + (Director of Compliance (2 hours) at 
$388 per hour) + (Compliance Attorney (5 hours) at $270 per hour)) x 
(1000 reporting entities) = $6,236,000, which is $6,236 per 
reporting entity. Hourly figures cited in this release are from 
SIFMA's Management & Professional Earnings in the Securities 
Industry 2008 and SIFMA's Office Salaries in the Securities Industry 
2008, modified by Commission staff to account for an 1800-hour work-
year and multiplied by 5.35 or 2.93, as appropriate, to account for 
bonuses, firm size, employee benefits, and overhead. Because the 
Commission expects to adopt permanent reporting rules within one 
year, the Commission does not believe that Rule 13Aa-2T will 
generate any ongoing costs beyond the first 12 months. Accordingly, 
our estimates do not distinguish initial and ongoing costs.
---------------------------------------------------------------------------

    The Commission preliminarily estimates that the requirement to 
report the transaction confirmation and time, if available, of 
execution pursuant to Rule 13Aa-2T(b)(1) could result in a cost to each 
reporting entity of approximately $43,900 and an aggregate cost of 
approximately $43,900,000.\74\ This cost figure includes two main 
components. These are, first, an estimate of the cost to establish 
connectivity to a security-based swap data repository; and second, an 
estimate of the cost to complete the reporting process.
---------------------------------------------------------------------------

    \74\ This figure is based on discussions of Commission staff 
with various market participants, as well as the Commission's 
experience regarding connectivity between securities market 
participants, including alternative trading systems and self-
regulatory organizations for data reporting purposes. The Commission 
derived the total estimated one-time burdens from the following: 
[($25,000/reporting entity to establish connectivity) x (1000 
reporting entities)] + [2,400,000 estimated total pre-enactment 
securities-based swap transactions) x (25 percent manual, electronic 
reporting) x (Compliance Clerk (0.5 hours/transaction) at $63 per 
hour)] = $43,900,000, which is $43,900 per reporting entity. This 
estimate is intended to include the costs of system development that 
will facilitate reporting the majority (estimated 75 percent) of 
security-based swap transactions. Because the Commission expects to 
adopt permanent reporting rules within one year, the Commission does 
not believe that Rule 13Aa-2T will generate any ongoing costs beyond 
the first 12 months. Accordingly, our estimates do not distinguish 
initial and ongoing costs.
---------------------------------------------------------------------------

    As stated above, the Commission estimates that it may make one 
request from each reporting entity pursuant to Rule 13Aa-2T(b)(2). The 
Commission preliminarily estimates that responding to Commission 
requests for information and documents could result in a cost to each 
reporting entity of approximately $6,352 and an aggregate cost of 
approximately $6,352,000.\75\
---------------------------------------------------------------------------

    \75\ This figure is based on the following: [((Compliance 
Manager (5 hours) at $258 per hour) + (Compliance Attorney (5 hours) 
at $271 per hour) + (Programmer Analyst (1 hour) at $193) + 
(Compliance Clerk (15 hours) at $63 per hour) + (Director of 
Compliance (3 hours) at $388 per hour) + (Sr. Database Administrator 
(5 hours) at $281 per hour)) x (1 Commission request per reporting 
entity) x (1000 reporting entities)] = $6,352,000, which is $6,352 
per reporting entity. Hourly figures are from SIFMA's Management & 
Professional Earnings in the Securities Industry 2008 and SIFMA's 
Office Salaries in the Securities Industry 2008, modified by 
Commission staff to account for an 1800-hour work-year and 
multiplied by 5.35 or 2.93, as appropriate, to account for bonuses, 
firm size, employee benefits, and overhead.
---------------------------------------------------------------------------

C. Request for Comment

    The Commission requests comment on the costs and benefits of Rule 
13Aa-2T discussed above, as well as any costs and benefits not already 
described that could result. The Commission also requests data to 
quantify any potential costs or benefits.
    <bullet> How can the Commission accurately estimate the costs and 
benefits?
    <bullet> What are the costs currently borne by entities covered by 
this rule with respect to the retention of records on security-based 
swap transactions?
    <bullet> How many entities will be affected by the rule? How many 
transactions will be subject to the rule?
    <bullet> Are there additional costs involved in complying with the 
rule that have not been identified? What are the types, and amounts, of 
the costs?
    <bullet> Are there additional benefits from the rule that have not 
been identified?

VII. Consideration of Burden on Competition and Promotion of 
Efficiency, Competition and Capital Formation

    Section 3(f) of the Exchange Act \76\ requires the Commission, 
whenever it engages in rulemaking and is required to consider or 
determine whether an action is necessary or appropriate in the public 
interest, to consider whether the action would promote efficiency, 
competition, and capital formation. In addition, Section 23(a)(2) of 
the Exchange Act \77\ requires the Commission, when making rules under 
the Exchange Act, to consider the impact of such rules on competition. 
Section 23(a)(2) also prohibits the Commission from adopting any rule 
that would impose a burden on competition not necessary or appropriate 
in furtherance of the purposes of the Exchange Act.
---------------------------------------------------------------------------

    \76\ 15 U.S.C. 78c(f).
    \77\ 15 U.S.C. 78w(a)(2).
---------------------------------------------------------------------------

    As discussed above, Rule 13Aa-2T will require counterparties to a 
pre-enactment security-based swap transaction to report: (1) To a 
registered security-based swap data repository or the Commission by the 
compliance date established in the reporting rules required under 
Sections 3C(e) and 13A(a)(1) of the Exchange Act, or within 60 days 
after a registered security-based swap data repository commences 
operations to receive and maintain data concerning such security-based 
swaps, whichever occurs first, a copy of the transaction confirmation, 
in electronic form, if available, or in written form, if there is no 
electronic copy, and the time, if available, the transaction was 
executed; and (2) to the Commission upon request any information 
relating to the security-based swap transactions.\78\ In addition, 
pursuant to the Note to paragraphs (b)(1) and (2) of Rule 13Aa-2T, any 
counterparty to a pre-enactment security-based swap transaction shall 
retain, in its existing format, all information and documents, if 
available, to the extent and in such form as they currently exist, 
relating to the terms of a pre-enactment security-based swap 
transaction.\79\
---------------------------------------------------------------------------

    \78\ See supra Section II.B for a discussion of which 
counterparty has the reporting obligation.
    \79\ This information will include, but is not limited to: Any 
information needed to identify and value the transaction; the date 
and time of execution of the transaction; all information from which 
the price of the transaction was derived; whether the transaction 
was accepted for clearing by any clearing agency or derivatives 
clearing organization and, if so, the identity of such clearing 
agency or derivatives clearing organization; any modification(s) to 
the terms of the transaction; and the final confirmation of the 
transaction.
---------------------------------------------------------------------------

    Although the Commission is required to promulgate rules governing 
the

[[Page 64653]]

reporting of pre-enactment security-based swap transactions, the 
Commission believes that by requiring the reporting of information 
about pre-enactment security-based swap transactions, this rule is an 
important first step in providing increased transparency to the market 
for security-based swaps, both to the participants or potential 
participants in the market and to regulators charged with overseeing a 
segment of the market that was previously not regulated. This increased 
transparency ultimately should provide the opportunity for increased 
competition among market participants and thus contribute to a more 
efficient market. This added visibility also should aid the Commission 
in carrying out its regulatory responsibilities by providing 
information that can be used to better understand and analyze the 
market. Further, a well-regulated security-based swap market may 
increase the confidence of market participants in the soundness of the 
market, potentially drawing additional participants into the market, 
increasing efficiency. The Commission also notes that all similarly 
situated respondents will be subject to the same requirements under the 
rule, and thus no participant should be at an unfair competitive 
advantage compared to others.
    The Commission requests comment on all aspects of this analysis 
and, in particular, on whether Rule 13Aa-2T will place a burden on 
competition, as well as the effect of the proposal on efficiency, 
competition, and capital formation. Commenters are requested to provide 
empirical data and other factual support for their views, if possible.

VIII. Regulatory Flexibility Certification

    The Commission hereby certifies that pursuant to 5 U.S.C. 605(b) 
that the interim final temporary rules contained in this release will 
not have a significant economic impact on a substantial number of small 
entities. The interim final temporary rules apply only to 
counterparties that may engage in security-based swap transactions. 
Prior to the effective date of the Dodd-Frank Act, only an eligible 
contract participant (as defined in Section 1(a)(12) of the Commodity 
Exchange Act) may enter into security-based swap transactions. For this 
reason, the interim final temporary rule should not have a significant 
economic impact on a substantial number of small entities.
