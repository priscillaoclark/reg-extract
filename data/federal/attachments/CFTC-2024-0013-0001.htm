SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION: On January 3, 2024, the Commission published 
in the Federal Register an NPRM proposing amendments to its regulations 
that would ensure clearing member funds and assets receive the proper 
treatment in the event the derivatives clearing organization (DCO) 
enters bankruptcy by requiring, among other things, that clearing 
member funds be segregated from the DCO's own funds and held in a 
depository that acknowledges in writing that the funds belong to 
clearing members, not the DCO.\2\ In addition, the Commission also 
proposed to permit DCOs to hold customer and clearing member funds at 
foreign central banks subject to certain requirements. Finally, the 
Commission proposed to require DCOs to conduct a daily calculation and 
reconciliation of the amount of funds owed to customers and clearing 
members and the amount actually held for customers and clearing 
members. The comment period for the NPRM was to close on February 16, 
2024. In response to a request by commenters, the Commission is 
extending the comment period for this NPRM by an additional 31 days.\3\ 
This extension of the comment period will allow interested persons 
additional time to analyze the proposal and prepare their comments.
