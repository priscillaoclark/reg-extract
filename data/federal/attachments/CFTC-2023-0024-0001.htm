SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION:
    Title: Generic Clearance for the Collection of Qualitative Feedback 
for Agency Service Delivery (OMB Control No. 3038-0107). This is a 
request for an extension of a currently approved information 
collection.
    Abstract: Executive Order 12862 directs Federal agencies to provide 
service to the public that matches or exceeds the best service 
available in the private sector. In order to work continuously to 
ensure that our programs are effective and meet our customers' needs, 
the Commodity Futures Trading Commission's Office of Customer Education 
and Outreach (OCEO) seeks to obtain OMB approval of a generic clearance 
to collect qualitative and quantitative feedback. By feedback we mean 
information that provides useful insights on perceptions and opinions, 
but are not statistically significant surveys that yield results that 
can be generalized to the population of study.
    This collection of information is necessary to enable the OCEO to 
garner customer and stakeholder feedback in an efficient and timely 
manner in accordance with our commitment to improving service delivery. 
The information collected from our customers and stakeholders will help 
ensure that users have an effective, efficient, and satisfying 
experience with OCEO programs. This feedback will provide insights into 
customer or stakeholder perceptions, experiences and expectations, 
provide an early warning of issues with service, or focus attention on 
areas where communication, training or changes in operations might 
improve delivery of products or services. These collections will allow 
for ongoing, collaborative and actionable communications between the 
OCEO and its customers and stakeholders. It will also allow feedback to 
contribute directly to the improvement of program management.
    On December 27, 2022, the Commission published in the Federal 
Register notice of the proposed extension of this information 
collection and provided 60 days for public comment on the proposed 
extension, 87 FR 79286 (60-Day Notice) The Commission did not receive 
any relevant comments on the 60-Day Notice.
    Burden Statement: This is a renewal request for a previous generic 
approval. No changes in requirements are anticipated. The respondent 
burden for this collection is estimated to be as follows:
    Estimated Number of Respondents Annually: 17,279.
    Estimated Average Burden Hours per Respondent: 0.29 hours or 
approximately 17 minutes.
    Estimated Total Annual Burden Hours: 4,000 hours (rounded).
    Frequency of Collection: Once per request.
    There are no capital costs or operating and maintenance costs 
associated with this collection.

(Authority: 44 U.S.C. 3501 et seq.)

    Dated: March 14, 2023.
Robert Sidman,
Deputy Secretary of the Commission.
