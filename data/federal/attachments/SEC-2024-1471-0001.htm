other security traded on a national securities exchange and defined 
as an NMS stock as set forth in Rule 4.3.

    Section 19(b)(2) of the Act \5\ provides that within 45 days of the 
publication of notice of the filing of a proposed rule change, or 
within such longer period up to 90 days as the Commission may designate 
if it finds such longer period to be appropriate and publishes its 
reasons for so finding, or as to which the self-regulatory organization 
consents, the Commission shall either approve the proposed rule change, 
disapprove the proposed rule change, or institute proceedings to 
determine whether the

sufficient time to consider the proposed rule change. Accordingly, the 
Commission, pursuant to Section 19(b)(2) of the Act,\6\ designates 
December 3, 2024 as the date by which the Commission shall either 
approve or disapprove, or institute proceedings to determine whether to 
disapprove, the proposed rule change (File No. SR-CBOE-2024-036).
