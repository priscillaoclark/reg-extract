SECURITIES AND EXCHANGE COMMISSION

[SEC File No. 270-141, OMB Control No. 3235-0249]


Submission for OMB Review; Comment Request; Extension: Rule 12f-3

Upon Written Request, Copies Available from: Securities and Exchange 
Commission, Office of FOIA Services, 100 F Street NE, Washington, DC 
20549-2736

    Notice is hereby given that pursuant to the Paperwork Reduction Act 
of 1995 (``PRA'') (44 U.S.C. 3501 et seq.), the Securities and Exchange 
Commission (``Commission'') has submitted to the Office of Management 
and Budget (``OMB'') a request for approval of extension of the 
previously approved collection of information provided for in Rule 12f-
3 (17 CFR 240.12f-3), under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 
(``Act'') (15 U.S.C. 78a et seq.).
    Rule 12f-3 (``Rule''), which was originally adopted in 1955 
pursuant to Sections 12(f) and 23(a) of the Act, and as further 
modified in 1995, sets forth the requirements to submit an application 
to the Commission for termination or suspension of unlisted trading 
privileges in a security, as contemplated under Section 12(f)(4) of the 
Act. In addition to requiring that one copy of the application be filed 
with the Commission, the Rule requires that the application contain 
specified information. Under the Rule, an application to suspend or 
terminate unlisted trading privileges must provide, among other things, 
the name of the applicant, a brief statement of the applicant's 
interest in the question of termination or suspension of such

[[Page 27817]]

unlisted trading privileges, the title of the security, the name of the 
issuer, certain information regarding the size of the class of 
security, the public trading volume and price history in the security 
for specified time periods on the subject exchange, and a statement 
indicating that the applicant has provided a copy of such application 
to the exchange from which the suspension or termination of unlisted 
trading privileges are sought and to any other exchange on which the 
security is listed or admitted to unlisted trading privileges.
    The information required to be included in applications submitted 
pursuant to Rule 12f-3 is intended to provide the Commission with 
sufficient information to make the necessary findings under the Act to 
terminate or suspend by order the unlisted trading privileges granted a 
security on a national securities exchange. Without the Rule, the 
Commission would be unable to fulfill these statutory responsibilities.
    The burden of complying with Rule 12f-3 arises when a potential 
respondent, having a demonstrable bona fide interest in the question of 
termination or suspension of the unlisted trading privileges of a 
security, determines to seek such termination or suspension. The staff 
estimates that each such application to terminate or suspend unlisted 
trading privileges requires approximately one hour to complete. Thus 
each potential respondent would incur on average one burden hour in 
complying with the Rule.
    The Commission staff estimates that there could be as many as 24 
responses annually for an aggregate burden for all respondents of 24 
hours. Each respondent's related internal cost of compliance for Rule 
12f-3 would be $242, or the cost of one hour of professional work of a 
paralegal needed to complete the application. The total annual internal 
cost of compliance for all potential respondents, therefore, is $5,808 
(124 responses x $242/response).
    Compliance with the application requirements of Rule 12f-3 is 
mandatory, though the filing of such applications is undertaken 
voluntarily. Rule 12f-3 does not have a record retention requirement 
per se. However, responses made pursuant to Rule 12f-3 are subject to 
the recordkeeping requirements of Rules 17a-3 and 17a-4 of the Act. 
Information received in response to Rule 12f-3 shall not be kept 
confidential; the information collected is public information.
    An agency may not conduct or sponsor, and a person is not required 
to respond to, a collection of information under the PRA unless it 
displays a currently valid OMB control number.

collection at the following website: <a href="http://www.reginfo.gov">www.reginfo.gov</a>. Find this
