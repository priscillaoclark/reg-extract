Background

    The Kingpin Act became law on December 3, 1999. The Kingpin Act 
establishes a program targeting the activities of significant foreign 
narcotics traffickers and their organizations on a worldwide basis. It 
provides a statutory framework for the President to impose sanctions 
against significant foreign narcotics traffickers and their 
organizations on a worldwide basis, with the objective of denying their 
businesses and agents access to the U.S. financial system and to the 
benefits of trade and transactions involving U.S. companies and 
individuals.
    The Kingpin Act blocks all property and interests in property, 
subject to U.S. jurisdiction, owned or controlled by significant 
foreign narcotics traffickers as identified by the President. In 
addition, the Kingpin Act blocks the property and interests in 
property, subject to U.S. jurisdiction, of foreign persons designated 
by the Secretary of Treasury, in consultation with the Attorney 
General, the Director of Central Intelligence, the Director of the 
Federal Bureau of Investigation, the Administrator of the Drug 
Enforcement Administration, the Secretary of Defense, the Secretary of 
State, and the Secretary of Homeland Security who are found to be: (1) 
Materially assisting in, or providing financial or technological 
support for or to, or providing goods or services in support of, the 
international narcotics trafficking activities of a person designated 
pursuant to the Kingpin Act; (2) owned, controlled, or directed by, or 
acting for or on behalf of, a person designated pursuant to the Kingpin 
Act; or (3) playing a significant role in international narcotics 
trafficking.
    On September 12, 2008, OFAC designated three additional individuals 
whose property and interests in property are blocked pursuant to 
section 805(b) of the Foreign Narcotics Kingpin Designation Act.
