    General Description of Collection: Section 7(j) of the FDIA (12 
U.S.C. 1817(j)) and sections 303.80-88 of the FDIC Rules and 
Regulations (12 CFR 303.80 et seq.) require that any person proposing 
to acquire control of an insured depository institution and certain 
parent companies thereof provide 60 days prior written notice of the 
proposed acquisition to the appropriate federal banking agency. Such 
written notice which pertains to the acquisition of control of an FDIC 
supervised institution and certain parent companies thereof is filed 
with the regional director of the FDIC region in which the bank is 
located. The FDIC reviews the information reported in the Notice to 
assess, in part, any anticompetitive and monopolistic effects of the 
proposed acquisition, to determine if the financial condition of any 
acquiring person or the future prospects of the institution might 
jeopardize the financial stability of the institution or prejudice the 
interests of the depositors of the institution, and to determine 
whether the competence, experience, or integrity of any acquiring 
person, or of any of the proposed management personnel, indicates that 
it would not be in the interest of the depositors of the institution, 
or in the interest of the public, to permit such persons to control the 
bank. The FDIC must also make an independent determination of the 
accuracy and completeness of all of the information required to be 
filed in conjunction with a Notice.
    The FDIC is increasing the total burden associated with this 
collection from 549 hours to 1,071 hours. This information collection 
contains a disclosure requirement, which was not recognized in the 2021 
submission. The 522 increase in burden hours is due to the addition of 
the disclosure requirement and the use of a more accurate methodology 
to estimate the number of respondents and responses per respondent.
    2. Title: Recordkeeping, Disclosure and Reporting Requirements in 
Connection with Regulation Z.
    OMB Number: 3064-0082.
    Form Number: None.

Note: The estimated annual IC time burden is the product, rounded to the nearest hour, of the estimated annual
  number of responses and the estimated time per response for a given IC. The estimated annual number of
  responses is the product, rounded to the nearest whole number, of the estimated annual number of respondents
  and the estimated annual number of responses per respondent. This methodology ensures the estimated annual
  burdens in the table are consistent with the values recorded in OMB's consolidated information system.

Source: FDIC.
Note: The estimated annual IC time burden is the product, rounded to the nearest hour, of the estimated annual
  number of responses and the estimated time per response for a given IC. The estimated annual number of
  responses is the product, rounded to the nearest whole number, of the estimated annual number of respondents
  and the estimated annual number of responses per respondent. This methodology ensures the estimated annual
  burdens in the table are consistent with the values recorded in OMB's consolidated information system.

    General Description of Collection: Consumer Financial Protection 
Bureau (CFPB) Regulation Z--12 CFR 1026 implements the Truth in Lending 
Act (15 U.S.C. 1601, et seq.) and certain provisions of the Real Estate 
Settlement Procedures Act (12 U.S.C. 2601 et seq.). This regulation 
prescribes uniform methods for computing the cost of credit, the 
disclosure of credit terms and costs, the resolution of errors and 
imposes various other recordkeeping,

[[Page 58162]]

reporting and disclosure requirements. The FDIC has enforcement 
authority on the requirements of the CFPB's Regulation over the 
financial institutions it supervises. This information collection 
captures the recordkeeping, reporting, and disclosure burdens of 
Regulation Z on FDIC-supervised institutions. To arrive at the 
estimated annual burden the FDIC assessed the number of potential 
respondents to the information collection by identifying the number of 
FDIC-supervised institutions who reported activity that would be within 
the scope of the information collection requirements according to data 
from the most recent Call Report. Additionally, the FDIC estimated the 
frequency of responses to the recordkeeping, reporting, or disclosure 
requirements by assessing the dollar volume of activity that would be 
within the scope of the information collection. In some instances, the 
FDIC used information provided by other sources to estimate the 
magnitude and scope of activity attributable to FDIC-supervised 
institutions when more immediate information sources did not exist.
    The estimated annual burden, in hours, is the product of the 
estimated number of respondents per year, estimated number of responses 
per respondent per year, and estimated hours per response, as 
summarized in Table 1 for the implementation burden and in Table 2 for 
the ongoing burden, below. The total estimated annual burden for this 
Information Collection Request (ICR) is 1,959,766 hours (288 hours 
estimated implementation burden, plus 1,959,488 hours estimated ongoing 
burden), which is a decrease of 71,838 hours from the 2021 estimate. As 
the estimated time per response remained the same from the 2021 ICR, 
the change in the total estimated annual burden hours is attributable 
to the decrease in the estimated number of respondents in Table 2.

Source: FDIC.
Note: The estimated annual IC time burden is the product, rounded to the nearest hour, of the estimated annual
  number of responses and the estimated time per response for a given IC. The estimated annual number of
  responses is the product, rounded to the nearest whole number, of the estimated annual number of respondents
  and the estimated annual number of responses per respondent. This methodology ensures the estimated annual
  burdens in the table are consistent with the values recorded in OMB's consolidated information system.

    General Description of Collection: Regulations E & DD (Consumer 
Financial Protection Bureau's Regulations) and Regulation CC (the 
Federal Reserve's Regulation) ensure adequate disclosures regarding 
accounts, including electronic fund transfer services, availability of 
funds, and fees and annual percentage yield for deposit accounts. 
Generally, the Regulation E disclosures are designed to ensure 
consumers receive adequate disclosure of basic terms, costs, and rights 
relating to electronic fund transfer (EFT) services provided to them so 
that they can make informed decisions. Institutions offering EFT 
services must disclose to consumers certain information, including: 
Initial and updated EFT terms, transaction information, the consumer's 
potential liability for unauthorized transfers, and error resolution 
rights and procedures. Like Regulation E, Regulation CC contains 
consumer protection disclosure requirements. Specifically, Regulation 
CC requires depository institutions to make funds deposited in 
transaction accounts available within specified time periods, disclose 
their availability policies to customers, and begin accruing interest 
on such deposits promptly. The disclosures are intended to alert 
customers that their ability to use deposited funds may be delayed, 
prevent unintentional (and costly) overdrafts, and allow customers to 
compare the policies of different institutions before deciding at which 
institution to deposit funds. Depository institutions must also provide 
an awareness disclosure regarding substitute checks. The regulation 
also requires notice to the depositary bank and to a customer of 
nonpayment of a check. Regulation DD also has similar consumer 
protection disclosure requirements that are intended to assist 
consumers in comparing deposit accounts offered by institutions, 
principally through the disclosure of fees, the annual percentage 
yield, and other account terms. Regulation DD requires depository 
institutions to disclose yields, fees, and other terms concerning 
deposit accounts to consumers at account opening, upon request, and 
when changes in terms occur. Depository institutions that provide 
periodic statements are required to include information about fees 
imposed, interest earned, and the annual percentage yield (APY) earned 
during those statement periods. It also contains rules about 
advertising deposit accounts. This Information Collection

[[Page 58164]]

Request (ICR) is being revised as a result of the addition of five (5) 
new information collection requirements contained in CFPB's Regulation 
E, Subpart B. The estimated annual burden, in hours, is the product of 
the estimated number of respondents per year, estimated number of 
responses per respondent per year, and estimated hours per response, as 
summarized in the Table above. The total estimated annual burden for 
this ICR is 546,946 hours, which is a decrease of 45,875 hours from our 
estimate in the 2021 memo (592,821 hours). This decrease can be 
explained largely by a decline in the number of FDIC-supervised IDIs 
from December 31, 2020 (the period used in the previous OMB renewal) to 
December 31, 2023. This decrease is attenuated by the inclusion of five 
ICs pertaining to recordkeeping and disclosure requirements associated 
with remittance transfers in Subpart B of CFPB Regulation E.
    The estimated annual burden and change in burden, broken down by 
each Regulation (E, DD, and CC), is as follows:
