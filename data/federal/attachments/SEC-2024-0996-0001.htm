    Section 19(b)(2) of the Act \26\ provides that, after initiating 
disapproval proceedings, the Commission shall issue an order approving 
or disapproving the proposed rule change not later than 180 days after 
the date of publication of notice of filing of the proposed rule 
change. The Commission may extend the period for issuing an order 
approving or disapproving the proposed rule change, however, by not 
more than 60 days if the Commission determines that a longer period is 
appropriate and publishes the reasons for such determination. The Cboe 
Options Proposal, the ISE iShares Proposal, the MIAX Proposal, and the 
MIAX Pearl Proposal were published for notice and comment in the 
Federal Register on January 25, 2024. July 23, 2024, is 180 days from 
that date. The NYSE American Proposal was published for notice and 
comment in the Federal Register on February 29, 2024. August 27, 2024,

were published for notice and comment in the Federal Register on March 
25, 2024. September 21, 2024, is 180 days from that date.
---------------------------------------------------------------------------

    \26\ 15 U.S.C. 78s(b)(2).
---------------------------------------------------------------------------

    The Commission finds it appropriate to designate a longer period 
within which to issue an order(s) approving or disapproving the 
Proposals so that it has sufficient time to consider the Proposals and 
the issues raised therein. Accordingly, the Commission, pursuant to 
Section 19(b)(2) of the Act,\27\ designates September 21, 2024, as the 
date by which the Commission shall either approve or disapprove the 
Cboe Options Proposal, the ISE iShares Proposal, the MIAX Proposal, and 
the MIAX Pearl Proposal (File Nos. SR-CBOE-2024-005; SR-ISE-2024-03; 
SR-MIAX-2024-03; and SR-PEARL-2024-03); October 26, 2024, as the date 
by which the Commission shall either approve or disapprove the NYSE 
American Proposal (File No. SR-NYSEAMER-2024-10); and November 20, 
2024, as the date by which the Commission shall either approve or 
disapprove the BOX Proposal and the ISE Trust Proposal (File Nos. SR-
