COMMODITY FUTURES TRADING COMMISSION


Renewal of the Agricultural Advisory Committee

AGENCY: Commodity Futures Trading Commission.

ACTION: Notice of renewal.

-----------------------------------------------------------------------

SUMMARY: The Commodity Futures Trading Commission (CFTC or Commission) 
is publishing this notice to announce the renewal of the Agricultural 
Advisory Committee (AAC). The Commission has determined that the 
renewal of the AAC is necessary and in the public's interest, and the 
CFTC has consulted with the General Services Administration's Committee 
Management Secretariat regarding the AAC's renewal.

FOR FURTHER INFORMATION CONTACT: John Dunfee, Chief Counsel, Office of 
the Chairman, at 202-418-5396 or <a href="/cdn-cgi/l/email-protection#85cfc1f0ebe3e0e0c5e6e3f1e6abe2eaf3"><span class="__cf_email__" data-cfemail="d59f91a0bbb3b0b095b6b3a1b6fbb2baa3">[email&#160;protected]</span></a>.

SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION: The CFTC's advisory committees were created 
to provide input and make recommendations to the Commission on a 
variety of regulatory and market issues that affect the integrity and 
competitiveness of U.S. derivatives markets. The committees facilitate 
communication between the Commission and U.S. derivatives markets, 
trading firms, market participants, and end users. The AAC is one of 
five CFTC advisory committees. The AAC's objectives and scope of 
activities are to provide the Commission with advice and 
recommendations on issues affecting agricultural producers; consumers; 
processors; lenders; other major market participants, including 
derivatives intermediaries, buy-side representatives, and exchanges; 
regulators; and others interested in or affected by the agricultural 
derivatives markets through public meetings. The AAC will operate for 
two years from the date of renewal unless the Commission directs that 
the AAC terminate on an earlier date. A copy of the AAC renewal charter 
has been filed with the Commission; the Senate Committee on 
Agriculture, Nutrition and Forestry; the House Committee on 
Agriculture; the Library of Congress; and the General Services 
Administration's Committee Management Secretariat. A copy of the 
renewal charter will be posted on the CFTC's website at <a href="http://www.cftc.gov">www.cftc.gov</a>.

    Dated: August 1, 2024.
Christopher Kirkpatrick,
Secretary of the Commission.
