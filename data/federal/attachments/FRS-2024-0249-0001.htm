Proposal Under OMB Delegated Authority To Extend for Three Years, With 
Revision, the Following Information Collection

    Collection title: Procurement Solicitation Package.
    Collection identifier: FR 1400.
    OMB control number: 7100-0180.
    General description of collection: The Board uses the Procurement 
Solicitation Package, which includes a supplier database and 
solicitation documents as appropriate, to assist in the competitive 
process of soliciting proposals from suppliers of goods and services. 
The Procurement Solicitation Package includes the Supplier Registration 
System (FR 1400A), the Solicitation Package (Solicitation, Offer, and 
Award Form; Supplier Information Form; Past Performance Data Sheet; and 
Past Performance Questionnaire) (FR 1400B), the Supplier Risk 
Management Offeror Questionnaire (FR 1400C), and the Subcontracting 
Report (FR 1400D). The information collected through the Procurement 
Solicitation Package is necessary for Board staff to fairly and 
accurately evaluate the merits of suppliers' proposals, to select the 
proposal most advantageous to the Board, taking into account price and 
other key factors, and to award and administer contracts after a 
supplier has been selected.
    Proposed revisions: The Board proposes to clear a new, event-
generated form, the Contractor Conflict of Interest Screening (FR 
1400E). The FR 1400E will be used to screen potential contractors that 
would be conducting research pertaining to the Board's mission (e.g., 
monetary policy, financial stability, or supervision and regulation) 
and/or have access to sensitive Board information such as confidential

[[Page 79591]]

supervisory information, in order to determine if they have any 
conflict of interests. The 1400E has four main sections: Financial 
Interests, Outside Employment or Consulting in Banking or Economic 
Industries, Work with Foreign Governments, and Relatives in Related 
Businesses. Applicants are asked to list assets that they, their 
spouse, or their minor children hold that might be conflicts of 
interest. The potential contractor is also asked to list any outside 
employment that is relevant to the Board, including any employment for 
or with a foreign government, within the past three years. Lastly, the 
applicant is asked to specify any position their spouse, child, parent, 
or sibling currently holds at a financial institution (such as a bank, 
bank holding company, savings and loan holding company, thrift or 
savings and loan association, or affiliate of any such entity; 
consulting or law firm advising financial institutions; economic 
forecasting or consulting firm; or a vendor/contractor) that works with 
the Federal Reserve System.
    Frequency: FR 1400A/FR 1400B/FR 1400C, event-generated; FR 1400D, 
semiannual.
    Respondents: Businesses and individuals.
    Total estimated number of respondents: 550.
    Estimated average hours per response: FR 1400A, 0.67; FR 1400B, 81; 
FR 1400C, 7.6; FR 1400D, 0.7; FR 1400E, 0.45.
    Total estimated change in burden: 27 hours.
    Total estimated annual burden hours: 24,979.

    Board of Governors of the Federal Reserve System, September 25, 
2024.
Benjamin W. McDonough,
Deputy Secretary and Ombuds of the Board.
