---------------------------------------------------------------------------

    \1\ Claymore Exchange-Traded Fund Trust, et al., Investment 
Company Act Release Nos. 27469 (Aug. 28, 2006) (notice) and 27483 
(Sept. 18, 2006) (order), as amended by Investment Company Act 
Release Nos. 27982 (Sept. 26, 2007) (notice) and 28019 (Oct. 23, 
2007) (order).

Summary of Application:  The Prior Order permits: (a) Open-end 
management investment companies, whose series are based on certain 
equity or fixed-income securities indexes (each, an ``Underlying 
Index''), to issue shares of limited redeemability; (b) secondary 
market transactions in the shares of the series to occur at negotiated 
prices; (c) dealers to sell shares to purchasers in the secondary 
market unaccompanied by a prospectus when prospectus delivery is not 
required by the Securities Act of 1933 (``Securities Act''); (d) 
certain affiliated persons of the series to deposit securities into, 
and receive securities from, the series in connection with the purchase 
and redemption of aggregations of the series' shares; (e) under certain 
circumstances, certain series to pay redemption proceeds more than 
seven days after the tender of shares; and (f) certain registered 
management investment companies and unit investment trusts outside of 
the same group of investment companies as the series to acquire shares 
of the series. Applicants seek to amend the Prior Order to: (a) Permit 
certain Funds (as defined below) to track an Underlying Index that is 
created, compiled, sponsored, or maintained by an index provider 
(``Index Provider'') that is an affiliated person, or an affiliated 
person of an affiliated person, of the Fund, its investment adviser, 
distributor, promoter, or any sub-adviser to the

[[Page 63223]]

Fund; (b) delete the relief granted from the requirements of section 
24(d) of the Act in the Prior Order and revise the applications on 
which the Prior Order was issued (``Prior Applications'') to reflect 
such deletion; (c) modify the 80%/90% investment requirement in the 
Prior Applications; (d) revise the discussion of depositary receipts 
(``Depositary Receipts'') in the Prior Applications; and (e) permit the 
personnel of the Adviser (as defined below) or any sub-adviser who are 
responsible for the designation and dissemination of the securities to 
be used for creations (``Deposit Securities'') or redemptions (``Fund 
Securities'') to also select securities for purchase or sale by 
---------------------------------------------------------------------------
actively-managed accounts of the Adviser or any sub-adviser.

Traded Fund Trust 2, Claymore Exchange-Traded Fund Trust 3 (each, a

search.htm</A>, or by calling (202) 551-8090.

Applicants' Representations

    1. Each Trust is organized as a Delaware statutory trust and is 
registered under the Act as an open-end management investment company. 
Each Trust offers one or more series (each a ``Fund''), each of which 
operates as an exchange-traded fund (``ETF''). The Adviser, a Delaware 
limited liability company, is registered as an investment adviser under 
the Investment Advisers Act of 1940 (the ``Advisers Act''). The Adviser 
serves as investment adviser to each of the Funds and may retain sub-
advisers (``Sub-Advisers'') to manage the assets of one or more of the 
Funds. Any Sub-Adviser will be registered under the Advisers Act. The 
Distributor, a broker-dealer registered under the Securities Exchange 
Act of 1934 (``Exchange Act''), serves as principal underwriter and 
distributor for each of the Funds.
    2. Applicants currently are permitted to offer Funds that operate 
in reliance on the Prior Order and seek to track the performance of 
Underlying Indexes from Index Providers that are not ``affiliated 
persons'' (as such term is defined in section 2(a)(3) of the Act), or 
affiliated persons of affiliated persons, of a Trust, the Adviser, any 
Sub-Adviser to a Fund, the Distributor or a promoter of a Fund. Certain 
Funds rely on the Prior Order and track an Underlying Index provided by 
either AlphaShares, LLC (``AlphaShares'') or Delta Global Indices, LLC 
(``Delta Global'') (collectively, the ``Affected Funds'').\2\ 
Currently, neither AlphaShares nor Delta Global is an affiliated 
person, nor an affiliated person of an affiliated person, of a Trust, 
the Adviser, or any Sub-Adviser to a Fund, the Distributor or promoter 
of a Fund.
---------------------------------------------------------------------------

    \2\ AlphaShares is the Index Provider for Guggenheim China Real 
Estate ETF, Guggenheim China Small Cap ETF, Guggenheim China All-Cap 
ETF, and Guggenheim China Technology ETF. Delta Global is the Index 
Provider for Guggenheim Shipping ETF.
---------------------------------------------------------------------------

    3. Applicants seek to amend the Prior Order to permit an Affected 
Fund to track an Underlying Index that is created, compiled, sponsored, 
or maintained by an Index Provider that is an affiliated person, as 
defined in section 2(a)(3) of the Act, or an affiliated person of an 
affiliated person, of a Trust, the Adviser, the Distributor, promoter, 
or any Sub-Adviser to the Affected Fund solely because the Index 
Provider serves as a Sub-Adviser to a Subadvised Fund (as defined 
below).\3\ The Adviser proposes to offer a closed-end fund (``Closed-
End Fund'') for which AlphaShares would serve as Sub-Adviser. In 
reliance on an order granting relief with respect to the offering of 
actively managed Future Funds,\4\ the Adviser and Claymore Exchange-
Traded Fund Trust 3 propose to offer three actively managed ETFs for 
which Delta Global would serve as Sub-Adviser. Because the Adviser 
serves or will serve as investment adviser to each, the Affected Funds 
and each Subadvised Fund could be deemed to be under common control for 
purposes of section 2(a)(3). In addition, section 2(a)(3)(E) provides 
that any investment adviser to an investment company is deemed to be an 
affiliated person of such company. Accordingly, by serving as Sub-
Adviser to a Subadvised Fund, each of AlphaShares and Delta Global 
could be deemed to be an affiliated person of an affiliated person of 
the Adviser and/or the Fund(s) for which it serves as Index Provider. 
As a result, applicants would not be permitted to retain either 
AlphaShares or Delta Global as Sub-Adviser to a Subadvised Fund, absent 
further exemptive relief.
---------------------------------------------------------------------------

    \3\ Applicants request that the requested order apply to any 
future series of the Trusts or other registered investment company 
advised by the Adviser or a person controlling, controlled by, or 
under common control with the Adviser that operates as an ETF (a 
``Future Fund'') for which the Index Provider also serves as Sub-
Adviser to another Fund or Future Fund or other registered 
investment company advised by the Adviser, or a person controlling, 
controlled by, or under common control with the Adviser 
(collectively ``Subadvised Funds'').
    \4\ Claymore Exchange-Traded Fund Trust 3, et al., Investment 
Company Act Release No. 29256 (Apr. 23, 2010) (notice) and 29271 
(May 18, 2010) (order).
---------------------------------------------------------------------------

    4. Applicants state that the conflicts of interest that could 
result if an Index Provider has a proscribed relationship with a Trust, 
the Adviser, any Sub-Adviser, the Distributor, or promoter of a Fund 
include the ability of an affiliated person to manipulate the 
Underlying Index to the benefit or detriment of the Fund, as well as 
conflicts that may also arise with respect to the personal trading 
activity of personnel of the affiliated person who may have access to, 
or knowledge of, changes to an Underlying Index's composition 
methodology or the constituent securities in an Underlying Index prior 
to the time that information is publicly disseminated. Applicants 
believe that these conflicts of interest are not applicable to the 
Affected Funds because the Adviser is not part of the

[[Page 63224]]

same organization as either Index Provider. Accordingly, the Adviser 
will not be informed of any additions to or deletions from an 
Underlying Index tracked by an Affected Fund (each, an ``Applicable 
Underlying Index'') prior to other market participants or the general 
public. Applicants state that the Adviser therefore will not have any 
ability to manipulate the components of the Applicable Underlying 
Indexes for its own benefit, nor will it have an informational 
advantage over other market participants with regard to additions to or 
deletions from the Applicable Underlying Indexes. Applicants further 
state that the Adviser will not have any role in the (a) modification 
of an Applicable Underlying Index's methodology, (b) selection of an 
Applicable Underlying Index's constituents, or (c) calculation or 
dissemination of an Applicable Underlying Index's value, and shall have 
no access to the information involved with items (a)-(c) or any changes 
thereto prior to their public dissemination in advance of the 
rebalancing of an Applicable Underlying Index or any interim 
modification arising from any corporate action.
    5. Applicants also state that the Adviser and the Index Providers 
have adopted policies and procedures designed to prevent the 
dissemination and improper use of non-public information in a manner 
similar to firewalls. Each of the Adviser, AlphaShares, and Delta 
Global has adopted written policies and procedures in accordance with 
rule 206(4)-7 under the Advisers Act, that contains: (a) A section that 
sets forth the applicable entity's insider trading policy and that 
includes the applicable entity's procedures to prevent and detect the 
misuse of material non-public information; and (b) the applicable 
entity's code of ethics which was adopted pursuant to rule 17j-1 under 
the Act and rule 204A-1 under the Advisers Act, which contains 
provisions reasonably necessary to prevent Access Persons (as defined 
in rule 17j-1) of the applicable entity from trading on the basis of, 
improperly disseminating or otherwise engaging in any improper use of 
nonpublic information.
    6. Applicants further state that they will adopt, and will require 
AlphaShares and Delta Global to adopt, policies and procedures that 
require the Applicable Underlying Indexes to be transparent. Each of 
AlphaShares and Delta Global will maintain a publicly available Web 
site on which it will publish the basic concept of each Applicable 
Underlying Index and disclose (a) the composition methodology for each 
such Applicable Underlying Index (``Index Composition Methodology'') 
and (b) the components and weightings of the components of each 
Applicable Underlying Index (as of each rebalancing or interim 
modification arising from a corporate action). Applicants note that the 
identity and weightings of the component securities of the Applicable 
Underlying Index will be readily ascertainable by a third party because 
the Index Composition Methodology will be publicly available. Although 
each of AlphaShares and Delta Global reserves the right to modify its 
Index Composition Methodology in the future, such modifications would 
not take effect until the applicable Index Provider has given the 
Calculation Agent (as defined below) and the investing public at least 
60 days' prior written notice, disclosed on the publicly available Web 
site of such Index Provider, that such changes are being planned to 
take effect.\5\ Each Underlying Index will be reconstituted or 
rebalanced no more frequently than on a monthly basis.
---------------------------------------------------------------------------

    \5\ The ``Calculation Agent'' is the entity that will implement 
the Index Composition Methodology, calculate and maintain the 
Applicable Underlying Indexes, and calculate and disseminate the 
Applicable Underlying Index values. The Calculation Agent is not and 
will not be an affiliated person within the meaning of section 
2(a)(3) of the Act, or an affiliated person of an affiliated person, 
of a Trust, the Adviser, any Sub-Adviser, the Distributor, or a 
promoter of a Fund. The Calculation Agent will be instructed not to 
communicate any non-public information about the Applicable 
Underlying Indexes to anyone, but specifically not to the personnel 
of the Adviser with responsibility for the portfolio management of 
the Affected Funds. The Calculation Agent will be instructed to 
disseminate information about the daily constituents of the 
Applicable Underlying Indexes to the Adviser (on behalf of the 
Affected Funds) and the public at the same time.
---------------------------------------------------------------------------

    7. Applicants represent that any Index Provider to an existing Fund 
or a Future Fund that enters into a similar arrangement to serve as 
Sub-Adviser to a Subadvised Fund will be subject to the same policies 
and procedures as proposed herein with respect to AlphaShares and Delta 
Global. Applicants further represent that any relief granted pursuant 
to the application will only apply to an Index Provider whose 
affiliation with a Trust, the Adviser or any Sub-Adviser to a Fund, 
Distributor or promoter of a Fund arises from relationships such as 
those described in the application. Applicants acknowledge that Index 
Providers whose affiliation arises from relationships other than those 
described in the application may not serve as Index Provider to a Fund 
without additional exemptive relief.

Additional Changes to Prior Order

    1. Applicants seek to amend the Prior Order to delete the relief 
granted from section 24(d) of the Act. Applicants believe that the 
deletion of the exemption from section 24(d) is warranted because the 
adoption of the summary prospectus should supplant any need by a Fund 
to use a product description (``Product Description'').\6\ The deletion 
of the relief granted with respect to section 24(d) of the Act from the 
Prior Order will also result in the deletion of related discussions in 
the Prior Applications, revision of the Prior Applications to delete 
references to Product Descriptions, including in the conditions, and 
the deletion of condition 5 to the Prior Order.\7\
---------------------------------------------------------------------------

    \6\ Investment Company Act Release No. 28584 (Jan. 13, 2009) 
(the ``Summary Prospectus Rule'').
    \7\ Condition 5 states: Before a Fund may rely on the order, the 
Commission will have approved, pursuant to rule 19b-4 under the 
Exchange Act, an Exchange rule requiring Exchange members and member 
organizations effecting transactions in Fund Shares to deliver a 
Product Description to purchasers of Fund Shares.
---------------------------------------------------------------------------

    2. The Prior Applications state that a Fund will hold, in the 
aggregate, at least 80 percent or 90 percent of its total assets in the 
securities that comprise the relevant Underlying Index (``Component 
Securities''), and investments that have economic characteristics that 
are substantially identical to the economic characteristics of the 
Component Securities of its Underlying Index. Applicants seek to amend 
the Prior Order to require a Fund to hold at least 80 percent of its 
total assets in Component Securities of its Underlying Index or in 
Depositary Receipts or to-be-announced transactions (``TBAs'') 
representing Component Securities (or underlying securities 
representing Depositary Receipts, if Depositary Receipts are themselves 
Component Securities).
    3. Applicants wish to amend the Prior Order to revise certain 
representations regarding a Fund's ability to invest in Depositary 
Receipts. The Prior Applications state, among other things, that a Fund 
will invest only in Depositary Receipts listed on a national securities 
exchange as defined in section 2(a)(26) of the Act and that all 
Depositary Receipts in which a Fund invests will be sponsored by the 
issuers of the underlying security, except in certain circumstances. 
Applicants seek to amend the Prior Applications to state that 
Depositary Receipts include American Depositary Receipts (``ADRs'') and 
Global Depositary Receipts (``GDRs''). With respect to ADRs, the 
depositary is typically a U.S. financial institution, and the 
underlying

[[Page 63225]]

securities are issued by a foreign issuer. The ADR is registered under 
the Securities Act on Form F-6. ADR trades occur either on an Exchange 
or off-exchange. Rule 6620 of the Financial Industry Regulatory 
Authority (``FINRA'') requires all off-exchange transactions in ADRs to 
be reported within 90 seconds and ADR trade reports to be disseminated 
on a real-time basis. With respect to GDRs, the depositary may be 
foreign or a U.S. entity, and the underlying securities may have a 
foreign or a U.S. issuer. All GDRs are sponsored and trade on a foreign 
exchange. No affiliated persons of applicants will serve as the 
depositary for any Depositary Receipts held by a Fund. A Fund will not 
invest in any Depositary Receipts that the Adviser deems to be illiquid 
or for which pricing information is not readily available.
    4. Applicants also seek to amend the terms and conditions of the 
Prior Applications to provide that all representations and conditions 
contained in the Prior Applications that require a Fund to disclose 
particular information in the Fund's prospectus and/or annual report 
shall remain effective with respect to the Fund until the time the Fund 
complies with the disclosure requirements adopted by the Commission in 
the Summary Prospectus Rule. Applicants believe that the proposal to 
supersede the representations and conditions requiring certain 
disclosures in the Prior Applications is warranted because the 
Commission's amendments to Form N-1A with respect to ETFs as part of 
the Summary Prospectus Rule reflect the Commission's view with respect 
to the appropriate types of prospectus and annual report disclosures 
for an ETF.
    5. Applicants also wish to amend the Prior Order to permit the 
personnel of the Adviser or any Sub-Adviser who are responsible for the 
designation and dissemination of Deposit Securities or Fund Securities 
to also select securities for purchase or sale by actively-managed 
accounts of the Adviser or Sub-Adviser. The Prior Applications 
currently state that such personnel will have no responsibilities for 
the selection of securities for purchase or sale by any actively-
managed accounts of the Adviser or Sub-Adviser. Applicants state that 
the Codes of Ethics adopted by the Adviser and Distributor, among other 
procedures, adequately address any conflicts of interest. Applicants 
also note that the Commission more recently has granted exemptive 
relief with respect to index-based ETFs that does not contain the 
prohibition on adviser personnel designating securities for a creation 
or redemption with respect to such ETFs and also managing actively-
managed accounts for the adviser.

Applicants' Conditions

    Applicants agree that any order granting the requested relief will 
be subject to the same conditions as those imposed by the Prior Order, 
except for condition 5 to the Prior Order, which will be deleted.\8\
---------------------------------------------------------------------------

    \8\ As noted above, all representations and conditions contained 
in the application and the Prior Applications that require a Fund to 
disclose particular information in the Fund's prospectus and/or 
annual report shall remain effective with respect to the Fund until 
the time that the Fund complies with the disclosure requirements 
adopted by the Commission in the Summary Prospectus Rule.

    For the Commission, by the Division of Investment Management, 
pursuant to delegated authority.

Deputy Secretary.
