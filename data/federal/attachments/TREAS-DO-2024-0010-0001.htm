SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION:

I. Background

    The regulations at part 802 to title 31 of the Code of Federal 
Regulations (part 802) implement the provisions in section 721 of the 
Defense Production Act of 1950, as amended (Section 721) and establish 
the process and procedures of the Committee on Foreign Investment in 
the United States (CFIUS or the Committee) with respect to reviewing 
transactions involving the purchase or lease by, or concession to, a 
foreign person of certain real estate in the United States.
    Section 721 authorizes the president or his designee (i.e., CFIUS) 
to review certain real estate transactions by foreign persons where the 
real estate at issue is located in the United States and (a) is located 
within, or will function as part of, an air or maritime port; or (b) is 
in close proximity to a United States military installation or another 
facility or property of the United States Government that is sensitive 
for reasons relating to national security; could reasonably provide the 
foreign person the ability to collect intelligence on activities being 
conducted at such an installation, facility, or property; or could 
otherwise expose national security activities at such an installation, 
facility, or property to the risk of foreign surveillance.
    The current regulations at part 802 identify a subset of military 
installations around which certain real estate transactions are covered 
under CFIUS's jurisdiction. The specific military installations are 
listed in appendix A by name and location (or township/range), and 
section 802.227 sets forth the category descriptions of the military 
installations identified in appendix A. The locations listed in 
appendix A are intended to aid in the identification of the relevant 
installations only and do not represent specific boundaries of the 
installations for purposes of determining whether a transaction is a 
covered real estate transaction.
    The preamble to the final rule establishing part 802 (see 85 FR 
3158) noted that the military installations listed in the appendix were 
identified by the U.S. Department of Defense (Department of Defense) 
based upon an evaluation of national security considerations, and that 
the Department of Defense will continue on an ongoing basis to assess 
its military installations and the geographic scope established under 
the rules to ensure appropriate application in light of national 
security considerations. In 2023, as a result of the assessment of 
military installations by the Department of Defense at that time, 
amendments made to the regulations added eight military installations 
to appendix A and updated the names of five military installations (see 
88 FR 57348, published August 23, 2023). Since then, the Department of 
Defense has completed a comprehensive assessment of its military 
installations through coordination across all military services, 
considering factors such as the operations, assets, missions, and 
training at each installation and appropriateness for coverage under 
Section 721. While the Department of Defense continuously evaluates its 
military installations to ensure

[[Page 58654]]

appropriate application of Section 721 in light of national security 
considerations, the recent completion of this comprehensive assessment 
prompted the changes described in this proposed rule--namely, the 
addition of 40 military installations to part 1 of appendix A around 
which CFIUS's real estate jurisdiction generally extends one mile from 
the installation's boundary; the addition of 19 military installations 
to part 2 of appendix A around which CFIUS's real estate jurisdiction 
generally extends 100 miles from the installation's boundary; the 
movement of eight military installations from part 1 to part 2 of 
appendix A; the removal of one installation from part 1 and two 
installations from part 2; and corresponding revisions to the 
definition of the term ``military installation.'' Additionally, the 
names of 14 installations already in appendix A would be technically 
amended to reflect official installation name changes by the Department 
of Defense and the location of seven installations would be updated to 
more directly identify the installations' approximate location.

II. Discussion of the Rule

A. Amendments to the Military Installations Listed in Appendix A

    The appendix to the regulations at part 802 identifies certain 
bases, ranges, and other installations that, for the purposes of the 
regulation, meet the definition of ``military installation'' at section 
802.227 and, to assist in the identification of such installations, the 
related location (or township/range) information. The appendix is 
important in determining whether a transaction is a covered real estate 
transaction because of a nearby military installation. As relevant to 
this proposed rule, the installations identified in the appendix at 
part 1 meet one of the category descriptions in section 802.227 (b) to 
(o). Installations at part 2 meet one of the category descriptions in 
section 802.227 (h), (k), or (m).
    This proposed rule would revise appendix A to include the 59

installations from part 1 of appendix A and add them to part 2 (as

    Additionally, three sites currently included in appendix A would be 
removed. Cape Cod Air Force Station would be removed from part 1 
because it is located within Joint Base Cape Cod, which would be added 
to the appendix at part 2 as detailed above. Iowa National Guard Joint 
Force Headquarters would be removed from part 2 because it is located 
within Camp Dodge, which would be added to the appendix at part 2 as 
detailed above. Finally, Lackland Air Force Base would be removed from 
part 2 because it is located within Joint Base San Antonio, which would 
be moved from part 1 to part 2 of appendix A as detailed above.

B. Technical Amendments To Update Identification of Certain Military 
Installations

    This proposed rule would make technical amendments to update the 
names of 14 military installations based on recommendations of the 
Department of Defense Naming Commission, the establishment of the U.S. 
Space Force (Space Force), and other changes to reflect the official 
names of the installations at present.
    More specifically, these changes include technical corrections to 
the names of five military installations as a result of the 
recommendation of the Department of Defense Naming Commission available 
at <a href="https://www.defense.gov/News/News-Stories/Article/Article/3260434/dod-begins-implementing-naming-commission-recommendations/">https://www.defense.gov/News/News-Stories/Article/Article/3260434/dod-begins-implementing-naming-commission-recommendations/</a> as well as 
name changes to more accurately reflect the installations' official 
name.
    Additionally, on December 20, 2019, Congress established the Space 
Force as an armed force within the Department of the Air Force. Nine of 
the military installation names below are a result of the names having 
been officially changed by the Department of Defense and reflect 
efforts to align installations with space-focused operations under the 
appropriate military branch. These name changes are detailed below.

<bullet> Army Research Office (formerly Army Research Lab--Raleigh 
Durham)
<bullet> Biometric Technology Center Defense Forensics and Biometrics 
Agency (formerly Biometric Technology Center Biometrics Identity 
Management Activity)
<bullet> Buckley Space Force Base (formerly Buckley Air Force Base)
<bullet> Cape Canaveral Space Force Station (formerly Cape Canaveral 
Air Force Station)
<bullet> Cavalier Space Force Station (formerly Cavalier Air Force 
Station)
<bullet> Cheyenne Mountain Space Force Station (formerly Cheyenne 
Mountain Air Force Station)
<bullet> Clear Space Force Station (formerly Clear Air Force Station)
<bullet> Combat Capabilities Development Command Soldier Center 
(formerly U.S. Army Natick Soldier Systems Center)
<bullet> Eareckson Air Station (formerly Eareckson Air Force Station)
<bullet> Fort Eisenhower (formerly Fort Gordon)
<bullet> Patrick Space Force Base (formerly Patrick Air Force Base)
<bullet> Peterson Space Force Base (formerly Peterson Air Force Base)
<bullet> Schriever Space Force Base (formerly Schriever Air Force Base)
<bullet> Vandenberg Space Force Base (formerly Vandenberg Air Force 
Base)

    The locations of seven installations on the appendix at parts 1 and 
2 would be updated to assist the public in identifying the 
installations by reference to their specific location. While these 
seven installations have not relocated, the updates to the location 
information are for the purposes of providing further clarity in 
identifying relevant sites. Some of the location updates pertain to 
installations also discussed above due to name changes.

<bullet> Army Research Office, located in Durham, NC (formerly Army 
Research Lab--Raleigh Durham, located in Raleigh Durham, NC)
<bullet> Camp Mackall, located in Southern Pines, NC (formerly Camp 
Mackall, located in Pinebluff, NC)
<bullet> Fort Campbell, located in Hopkinsville, KY and Clarksville, TN 
(formerly Fort Campbell, located in Hopkinsville, KY)
<bullet> Fort Johnson, located in Vernon Parrish, LA (formerly Fort 
Johnson, located in Leesville, LA)
<bullet> Fort Knox, located in Elizabethtown, KY (formerly Fort Knox, 
located in Fort Knox, KY)
<bullet> Fort Leavenworth, located in Leavenworth County, KS (formerly 
Fort Leavenworth, located in Leavenworth, KS)
<bullet> Hardwood Range, located in Necedah, WI (formerly Hardwood 
Range, located in Necehuenemedah, WI)

C. Amendments to the Definition of ``Military Installation''

    This proposed rule would also make several amendments to the 
definition of the term ``military installation'' at section 802.227 of 
the regulations. As defined in the current regulations, the term 
``military installation'' means any site that meets certain category 
descriptions, and as identified in appendix A to part 802. The 
definition of ``military installation'' would be amended with respect 
to paragraphs (e), (f), (g), (l), (m), and (n) of section 802.227.
    Consistent with name changes discussed in section B above, 
paragraphs (e) and (f) of section 802.227 would be amended to add Space 
Force bases, stations, and major annexes thereof. Paragraphs (g), (l), 
(m), and (n) of section 802.227 would be amended to expand the list of 
applicable installations that meet these category descriptions. With 
respect to paragraph (g) of section 802.227, Army major depots, 
arsenals, and military terminals, including those that are not 
collocated with an Army installation included in the appendix, would be 
added as covered installations under this category description. For 
paragraph (l), the proposed rule would remove the exclusion for Marine 
Corps installations, logistics battalions, and support facilities from 
this category description. Paragraph (m) of section 802.227 would be 
amended to remove the set of states and reference to military ranges 
owned by the Navy or Air Force. Certain real estate transactions near 
military ranges owned by each of the Armed Forces could reasonably 
provide a foreign person the ability to collect intelligence or perform 
surveillance or could otherwise expose national security activities at 
such installations. This proposed change broadens the category to any 
military range as appropriate and is consistent with the definition of 
military range as defined in 10 U.S.C. 101(f)(1), which defines a range 
as ``a designated land or water area that is set aside, managed, and 
used for range activities of the Department of Defense.'' Finally, 
paragraph (n) would be amended by removing the reference to the 
Submarine Force Atlantic and Submarine Force Pacific squadrons and 
supporting commands and adding major support activities and annexes. 
This would broaden the category to include any relevant Naval base and 
air station and major support activities and annexes thereof, as 
identified by the Department of Defense.

III. Rulemaking Requirements

Executive Order 12866

    This rule is not subject to the general requirements of Executive 
Order 12866, as amended, which covers review of regulations by the 
Office of Information and Regulatory Affairs in the Office of 
Management and Budget (OMB), because it relates to a foreign affairs 
function of the United States, pursuant to section 3(d)(2) of that 
order. In

[[Page 58656]]

addition, this rule is not subject to review under section 6(b) of 
Executive Order 12866 pursuant to section 1(d) of the June 9, 2023, 
Memorandum of Agreement between the Treasury Department and OMB, which 
states that CFIUS regulations are not subject to OMB's standard 
centralized review process under Executive Order 12866.

Regulatory Flexibility Act

    The Regulatory Flexibility Act (RFA) (5 U.S.C. 601 et seq.) 
generally requires an agency to prepare a regulatory flexibility 
analysis, unless the agency certifies that the rule will not, once 
implemented, have a significant economic impact on a substantial number 
of small entities. The RFA applies whenever an agency is required to 
publish a general notice of proposed rulemaking under section 553(b) of 
the Administrative Procedure Act (APA) (5 U.S.C. 553), or any other 
law. As set forth below, because regulations issued pursuant to the 
Defense Production Act of 1950, as amended (DPA), such as these 
regulations, are not subject to the APA, or other law requiring the 
publication of a general notice of proposed rulemaking, the RFA does 
not apply.
    This proposed rule makes amendments to the regulations implementing 
section 721 of the DPA. Section 709(a) of the DPA provides that the 
regulations issued under it are not subject to the rulemaking 
requirements of the APA. Section 709(b)(1) instead provides that any 
regulation issued under the DPA be published in the Federal Register 
and opportunity for public comment be provided for not less than 30 
days. Section 709(b)(3) of the DPA also provides that all comments 
received during the public comment period be considered and the 
publication of the final regulation contain written responses to such 
comments. Consistent with the plain text of the DPA, legislative 
history confirms that Congress intended that regulations under the DPA 
be exempt from the notice and comment provisions of the APA and instead 
provided that the agency include a statement that interested parties 
were consulted in the formulation of the final regulation. See H.R. 
Conf. Rep. No. 102-1028, at 42 (1992) and H.R. Rep. No. 102-208 pt. 1, 
at 28 (1991). The limited public participation procedures described in 
the DPA do not require a general notice of proposed rulemaking as set 
forth in the RFA. Further, the mechanisms for publication and public 
participation are sufficiently different to distinguish the DPA 
procedures from a rule that requires a general notice of proposed 
rulemaking. In providing the President with expanded authority to 
suspend or prohibit certain real estate transactions involving foreign 
persons if such a transaction would threaten to impair the national 
security of the United States, Congress could not have contemplated 
that regulations implementing such authority would be subject to RFA 
analysis. For these reasons, the RFA does not apply to these 
regulations. Regardless of whether the provisions of the RFA apply to 
this rulemaking, for reasons noted in the preamble to the final rule 
establishing part 802 (see 85 FR 3158), the Treasury Department 
determined that the implementation of the provisions of Section 721 
relating to real estate transactions would most likely not affect a 
substantial number of small entities. The amendments in this rule do 
not change that analysis or determination. Notwithstanding this 
certification, the Treasury Department invites comments on the 
potential impacts of this rule on small entities.

facilities, Government property, Investigations, Investment companies, 
Investments, Land sales, National defense, Public lands, Real property
