SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION: 
    Title: Swap Data Recordkeeping and Reporting Requirements (OMB 
Control No. 3038-0096). This is a request for extension of a currently 
approved information collection.
    Abstract: The collection of information is needed to ensure that 
the CFTC and other regulators have access to swap data as required by 
the Commodity Exchange Act, as amended by the Dodd-Frank Wall Street 
Reform and Consumer Protection Act (``Dodd-Frank Act''). The Dodd-Frank 
Act directed the CFTC to adopt rules providing for the reporting of 
data relating to swaps. In 2012, the CFTC adopted Regulation 45, which 
imposes recordkeeping and reporting requirements relating to pre-
enactment and historical swaps.
    An agency may not conduct or sponsor, and a person is not required 
to respond to, a collection of information unless it displays a 
currently valid OMB control number. On October 24, 2022, the Commission 
published in the Federal Register notice of the proposed extension of 
this information collection and provided 60 days for public comment on 
the proposed extension, 87 FR 64205 (``60-Day Notice''). The Commission 
received no relevant comments that addressed its PRA burden estimates.
    Burden Statement: Provisions of CFTC Regulations 39.6, 45.2, 45.3, 
45.4, 45.5, 45.6, 45.10, and 45.14 result in information collection 
requirements within the meaning of the PRA. With respect to the ongoing 
reporting and recordkeeping burdens associated with swaps, the CFTC 
believes that SDs, SEFs, DCMs, DCOs, SDRs, MSPs, and non-SD/MSP 
counterparties incur an annual time-burden of 1,460,357 hours. This 
time-burden represents a proportion of the burden respondents incur to 
operate and maintain their swap data recordkeeping and reporting 
systems.The respondent burden for this collection is estimated to be as 
follows:
    Respondents/Affected Entities: Swap Dealers, Major Swap 
Participants, SEFs, DCMs, DCOs, and other counterparties to a swap 
transaction (i.e., end-user, non-SD/non-MSP counterparties).
    Estimated Number of Respondents: 1,732.
    Estimated Average Burden Hours per Respondent: 843 hours.\2\
---------------------------------------------------------------------------

    \2\ Average burden hour per respondent rounded to the nearest 
full hour.
---------------------------------------------------------------------------

    Estimated Total Annual Burden Hours: 1,460,357 hours.\3\
---------------------------------------------------------------------------

    \3\ This estimate reflects a revision to the Information 
Collection approved by OMB on November 16, 2022. See ICR Ref. No. 
202209-3038-003. Due to this revision, this figure has been revised 
from the estimate of 1,276,705 hours included in the 60-Day Notice.
