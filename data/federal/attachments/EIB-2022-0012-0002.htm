[Public Notice: 2022-3030]


Agency Information Collection Activities: Comment Request; Form 
Title: EIB 12-02 Credit Guarantee Facility Disbursement Approval 
Request

AGENCY: Export-Import Bank of the United States.

ACTION: Submission for OMB review and comments request.

-----------------------------------------------------------------------

SUMMARY: The Export-Import Bank of the United States (EXIM Bank), as 
part of its continuing effort to reduce paperwork and respondent 
burden, invites the public and other Federal Agencies to comment on the 
proposed information collection, as required by the Paperwork Reduction 
Act of 1995.
    EXIM Bank has an electronic disbursement approval processing system 
for guaranteed lenders with Credit Guarantee Facilities. After a Credit 
Guarantee Facility (CGF) has been authorized by EXIM Bank and legal 
documentation has been completed, the lender will obtain and review the 
required disbursement documents (e.g., invoices, bills of lading, 
Exporter's Certificate, etc.) and will disburse the proceeds of the 
loan for eligible goods and services. In order to obtain approval of 
the disbursement, the lender will access and complete an electronic 
questionnaire through EXIM Bank's online application system (EXIM 
Online). Using the form, the lender will input key data and request 
EXIM Bank's approval of the disbursement. EXIM Bank's action (approved 
or denied) is posted on the lender's history page. The information 
collected in the questionnaire will assist EXIM Bank in determining 
that each disbursement under a Medium-Term Guarantee meets all the 
terms and conditions for approval. The information collection tool can 
be reviewed at: <a href="http://exim.gov/sites/default/files/pub/pending/eib12-02.pdf">http://exim.gov/sites/default/files/pub/pending/eib12-02.pdf</a>.
