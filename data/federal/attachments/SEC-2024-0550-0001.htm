I. Self-Regulatory Organization's Statement of the Terms of Substance 
of the Proposed Rule Change

    FINRA is proposing to retire the FINRA Rule 10000 Series (Code of 
Arbitration Procedure) that governs arbitration and mediation claims 
filed in the forum administered by FINRA Dispute Resolution Services 
(``DRS'') prior to April 16, 2007.
    The text of the proposed rule change is available on FINRA's 
website at <a href="http://www.finra.org">http://www.finra.org</a>, at the principal office of FINRA and 
at the Commission's Public Reference Room.

II. Self-Regulatory Organization's Statement of the Purpose of, and 
Statutory Basis for, the Proposed Rule Change

    In its filing with the Commission, FINRA included statements 
concerning the purpose of and basis for the proposed rule change and 
discussed any comments it received on the proposed rule change. The 
text of these statements may be examined at the places specified in 
Item IV below. FINRA has prepared summaries, set forth in sections A, 
B, and C below, of the most significant aspects of such statements.

A. Self-Regulatory Organization's Statement of the Purpose of, and 
Statutory Basis for, the Proposed Rule Change

1. Purpose
    The FINRA Rule 10000 Series (``old Code'') applies to arbitration 
and mediation claims filed in the DRS forum prior to April 16, 2007. As 
part of a comprehensive plan to reorganize and simplify the old Code, 
FINRA previously separated the old Code into three sections: the Code 
of Arbitration Procedure for Customer Disputes (``Customer Code''); the 
Code of Arbitration Procedure for Industry Disputes (``Industry 
Code''); and the Code of Mediation Procedure (``Mediation Code'') 
(together, ``Codes'').\4\ The Codes apply to claims filed in the DRS 
forum on or after April 16, 2007.\5\
---------------------------------------------------------------------------

    \4\ See Securities Exchange Act Release No. 52705 (October 31, 
2005), 70 FR 67525 (November 7, 2005) (Order Approving File No. SR-
NASD-2004-013); Securities Exchange Act Release No. 55158 (January 
24, 2007), 72 FR 4574 (January 31, 2007) (Order Approving File Nos. 
SR-NASD-2003-158 and SR-NASD-2004-011). See also Securities Exchange 
Act Release No. 58643 (September 25, 2008), 73 FR 57174 (October 1, 
2008) (Order Approving File Nos. SR-FINRA-2008-021; SR-FINRA-2008-
022; SR-FINRA-2008-026; SR-FINRA-2008-028 and SR-FINRA-2008-029) 
(consolidating NASD rules, including the Codes, as FINRA rules in 
the consolidated FINRA rulebook).
    \5\ The FINRA Rule 12000 Series contains the Customer Code; the 
FINRA Rule 13000 Series contains the Industry Code; and the FINRA 
Rule 14000 Series contains the Mediation Code.
---------------------------------------------------------------------------

    The proposed rule change would retire the old Code. All mediation 
and arbitration claims that were filed in the DRS forum prior to April 
16, 2007, and governed by the old Code, have closed. Thus, the old Code 
is no longer applicable to any mediation or arbitration claims filed in 
the DRS forum.
    FINRA has filed the proposed rule change for immediate 
effectiveness.
2. Statutory Basis
    FINRA believes that the proposed rule change is consistent with the 
provisions of Section 15A(b)(6) of the Act,\6\ which requires, among 
other things, that FINRA rules must be designed to prevent fraudulent 
and manipulative acts and practices, to promote just and equitable 
principles of trade, and, in general, to protect investors and the 
public interest.
---------------------------------------------------------------------------

    \6\ 15 U.S.C. 78o-3(b)(6).
---------------------------------------------------------------------------

    The proposed rule change will protect investors and the public 
interest by eliminating potential confusion and providing greater 
regulatory clarity to forum users regarding the rules applicable to 
claims filed in the DRS forum as it will retire the old Code, which is 
no longer applicable to any arbitration or mediation claims filed in 
the DRS forum.

B. Self-Regulatory Organization's Statement on Burden on Competition

    FINRA does not believe that the proposed rule change will result in 
any burden on competition that is not necessary or appropriate in 
furtherance of the purposes of the Act. The proposed rule change would 
retire the old Code that is no longer applicable to any arbitration or 
mediation claims filed in the DRS forum and, therefore, would not have 
additional economic impacts on FINRA members or their associated 
persons.

C. Self-Regulatory Organization's Statement on Comments on the Proposed 
Rule Change Received From Members, Participants, or Others

    Written comments were neither solicited nor received.

III. Date of Effectiveness of the Proposed Rule Change and Timing for 
Commission Action

    Because the foregoing proposed rule change does not: (i) 
significantly affect the protection of investors or the public 
interest; (ii) impose any significant burden on competition; and (iii) 
become operative for 30 days from the date on which it was filed, or 
such shorter time as the Commission may designate, it has become 
effective pursuant to Section 19(b)(3)(A) of the Act \7\ and Rule 19b-
4(f)(6) thereunder.\8\
---------------------------------------------------------------------------

    \7\ 15 U.S.C. 78s(b)(3)(A).
    \8\ 17 CFR 240.19b-4(f)(6).
---------------------------------------------------------------------------

    At any time within 60 days of the filing of the proposed rule 
change, the Commission summarily may temporarily suspend such rule 
change if it appears to the Commission that such action is necessary or 
appropriate in the public interest, for the protection of investors, or 
otherwise in furtherance of the purposes of the Act. If the Commission 
takes such action, the Commission shall institute proceedings to 
determine whether the proposed rule should be approved or disapproved.

IV. Solicitation of Comments

arguments concerning the foregoing, including whether the proposed rule 
change is consistent with the Act. Comments may be submitted by any of
