Background

    OFAC is amending the Sudanese Sanctions Regulations, 31 CFR part 
538 (the ``SSR''), and the Iranian Transactions Regulations, 31 CFR 
part 560 (the ``ITR''), to authorize the exportation to persons in 
Sudan and Iran, respectively, of certain services and software incident 
to the exchange of personal communications over the Internet.
    Unless authorized by a general or specific license, or otherwise 
exempt, the exportation of such services and software from the United 
States or by a United States person, wherever located, to Sudan or Iran 
is prohibited. Pursuant to section 538.205 of the SSR, the exportation 
or reexportation, directly or indirectly, to Sudan of any goods, 
technology, or services from the United States or by a United States 
person, wherever located, or requiring the issuance of a license by a 
Federal agency, is prohibited. As set forth in section 538.212(g)(1) of 
the SSR, however, this prohibition does not apply with respect to most 
exports and reexports to the Specified Areas of Sudan, as defined in 
section 538.320. In addition, pursuant to section 538.201 of the SSR, 
all property and interests in property of the Government of Sudan that 
are or come within the United States, or that are or come within the 
possession or control of U.S. persons, including their overseas 
branches, are blocked and may not be transferred, paid, exported, 
withdrawn or otherwise dealt in. The term property, as defined in 
section 538.310 of the SSR, specifically includes services. As defined 
in section 538.305 of the SSR, the term Government of Sudan does not 
include the regional government of Southern Sudan.
    Section 560.204 of the ITR provides that the exportation, 
reexportation, sale, or supply, directly or indirectly, from the United 
States or by a U.S. person, wherever located, of any goods, technology, 
or services to Iran or the Government of Iran is prohibited. The Iran-
Iraq Arms Non-Proliferation Act of 1992 (Pub. L. 102-484) (50 U.S.C. 
1701 note) (``IIANPA'') and section 6 of Executive Order 13059 of 
August 19, 1997 (``Prohibiting Certain Transactions With Respect to 
Iran'') (62 FR 44531, August 21, 1997), generally preclude OFAC from 
authorizing--whether by general or specific license--the exportation to 
Iran of any goods or technology listed on the Commerce Control List 
(``CCL'') in the Export Administration Regulations, 15 CFR parts 730 
through 774 (the ``EAR''), unless the President exercises the waiver 
authority provided in section 1606 of IIANPA. On September 27, 1994, 
the President delegated his authorities under IIANPA to the Secretary 
of State. Since much of the software necessary for the exchange of 
personal communications or the sharing of information over the Internet 
is listed on the CCL, the exercise of this waiver authority is 
necessary before OFAC may generally or specifically license the 
exportation of such software to Iran.
    On December 10, 2009, the Department of State determined that it is 
essential to the national interest of the United States to exercise the 
waiver authority in section 1606 of IIANPA with respect to the 
exportation to Iran of certain dual-use software classified as mass 
market software by the Department of Commerce (``Commerce'') and 
essential for the exchange of personal communications and/or sharing of 
information over the Internet. In reporting this determination to 
Congress on December 15, 2009, the Department of State explained that 
this software is necessary to foster and support the free flow of 
information to individual Iranian citizens and, therefore, is essential 
to the national interest of the United States.
    As events in Iran since last June's Presidential election there 
have shown, personal Internet-based communications are a vital tool for 
change. Similar considerations apply in Sudan. Accordingly, to ensure 
that the sanctions on Sudan and Iran do not have an unintended chilling 
effect on the ability of companies to provide personal communications 
tools to individuals in those countries, OFAC is adding new Sec.  
538.533 to the SSR and new Sec.  560.540 to the ITR. These new sections 
authorize the exportation from the United States or by U.S. persons, 
wherever located, to persons in Sudan and Iran, respectively, of 
certain services and software incident to the exchange of personal 
communications over the Internet, such as instant messaging, chat and 
e-mail, social networking, sharing of photos and movies, web browsing, 
and blogging. To qualify for this authorization, such services and 
software must be publicly available at no cost to the user. In 
addition, such software qualifies for this authorization only if it is 
(1) Classified as ``EAR99'' under the EAR; (2) not subject to the EAR; 
or (3) classified by Commerce as mass market software under export 
control classification number (``ECCN'') 5D992 of the EAR. These new 
sections of the SSR and the ITR, however, do not authorize the direct 
or indirect exportation of services or software with knowledge or 
reason to know that such services or software are intended for the 
Government of Sudan or the Government of Iran.
    New Sec.  538.533 of the SSR and new Sec.  560.540 of the ITR each 
contain a statement of licensing policy in addition to the general 
licenses authorizing the exportation of certain Internet-based personal 
communications services and software. Paragraph (c) of each of these 
two sections provides that specific licenses may be issued on a case-
by-case basis for the exportation of services and software not covered 
by the general license that are incident to the sharing of information 
over the Internet. To be eligible for consideration under this policy, 
software must be classified as ``EAR99,'' not subject to the EAR, or 
classified by Commerce as mass market software under ECCN 5D992 of the 
EAR.
    OFAC also is amending the Cuban Assets Control Regulations, 31 CFR 
part 515 (the ``CACR''), to add a similar general license authorizing 
the exportation to persons in Cuba of certain services incident to the 
exchange of personal communications over the Internet. Unless 
authorized by a general or specific license, the exportation of such 
services from the United States or by persons subject to U.S. 
jurisdiction to Cuba is prohibited. Section 515.201 of the CACR 
prohibits all dealings in, including, without limitation, transfers, 
withdrawals, or exportations of, any property in which Cuba or a Cuban 
national has any interest of any nature whatsoever, direct or indirect, 
by any person subject to the jurisdiction of the United States. The 
term property, as defined in Sec.  515.311 of the CACR, specifically 
includes services.
    On April 13, 2009, the President stated that the promotion of 
democracy and human rights in Cuba is in the national interest of the 
United States and is a key component of U.S. foreign policy in the 
Americas. The President announced an initiative to pursue these goals 
by, among other things, increasing the flow of information to the Cuban 
people. Consistent with that initiative, OFAC is adding new Sec.  
515.578 to the CACR to authorize the exportation from the United States 
or by persons subject to U.S. jurisdiction to persons in Cuba of 
certain services incident to the exchange of personal communications

[[Page 10999]]

over the Internet, such as instant messaging, chat and email, social 
networking, sharing of photos and movies, web browsing, and blogging. 
To qualify for this authorization, the services must be publicly 
available at no cost to the user. New Sec.  515.578 does not authorize 
the direct or indirect exportation of services with knowledge or reason 
to know that such services are intended for a prohibited official of 
the Government of Cuba, as defined in Sec.  515.337 of the CACR, or a 
prohibited member of the Cuban Communist Party, as defined in Sec.  
515.338.
    Like the new authorization sections added to the SSR and ITR, new 
Sec.  515.578 contains a statement of licensing policy in addition to 
the general license authorizing the exportation of certain Internet-
based personal communications services. Paragraph (c) of Sec.  515.578 
provides that specific licenses may be issued on a case-by-case basis 
for the exportation of services not covered by the general license that 
are incident to the sharing of information over the Internet.
    The new general license for Cuba, unlike those for Sudan and Iran, 
does not include an authorization for the exportation of software, 
because the exportation of goods and technology, including software, to 
Cuba is separately licensed or otherwise authorized by Commerce under 
the EAR. Section 515.533 of the CACR generally licenses all 
transactions ordinarily incident to the exportation of items from the 
United States, or the reexportation of 100% U.S.-origin items from a 
third country, to any person in Cuba, provided the exportation or 
reexportation is licensed or otherwise authorized by Commerce under the 
EAR, and provided further that only certain specified payment and 
financing terms may be used.
    By the addition of the authorizations described above to the SSR, 
ITR, and CACR, OFAC hopes to encourage the exchange of personal 
communications over the Internet by persons in Sudan, Iran, and Cuba.

Public Participation

    Because the amendments of the CACR, SSR, and ITR involve a foreign 
affairs function, Executive Order 12866 and the provisions of the 
Administrative Procedure Act (5 U.S.C. 553) requiring notice of 
proposed rulemaking, opportunity for public participation, and delay in 
effective date are inapplicable. Because no notice of proposed 
rulemaking is required for this rule, the Regulatory Flexibility Act (5 
U.S.C. 601-612) does not apply.

Paperwork Reduction Act

    The collections of information related to the CACR, SSR, and ITR 
are contained in the Reporting, Procedures and Penalties Regulations, 
31 CFR part 501. Pursuant to the Paperwork Reduction Act of 1995 (44 
U.S.C. 3507), those collections of information have been approved by 
the Office of Management and Budget under control number 1505-0164. An 
agency may not conduct or sponsor, and a person is not required to 
respond to, a collection of information unless the collection of 
information displays a valid control number.
