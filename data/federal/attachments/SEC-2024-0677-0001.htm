A. Self-Regulatory Organization's Statement of the Purpose of, and 
Statutory Basis for, the Proposed Rule Change

1. Purpose
    The Exchange proposes to amend its Pricing Schedule at Options 7, 
Section 2(1) to establish an additional incentive

[[Page 43934]]

for Participants with respect to Apple, Inc. (``AAPL'').
    Today, the Exchange assesses the following fees and rebates in 
Penny and Non-Penny Symbols:

                              Penny Symbols
------------------------------------------------------------------------
           Market participant              Maker rebate      Taker fee
------------------------------------------------------------------------
Lead Market Maker.......................     \2\ ($0.24)           $0.50
Market Maker............................     \2\ ($0.20)           $0.50
Non-Customer............................         ($0.12)           $0.50
Firm....................................         ($0.12)           $0.50
Customer................................         ($0.30)   \1\ \4\ $0.40
------------------------------------------------------------------------


                            Non-Penny Symbols
------------------------------------------------------------------------
                                           Maker rebate/
           Market participant                   fee          Taker fee
------------------------------------------------------------------------
Lead Market Maker.......................     \2\ ($0.45)           $1.25
Market Maker............................     \2\ ($0.40)           $1.25
Non-Customer............................           $0.45           $1.25
Firm....................................           $0.45           $1.25
Customer................................     \3\ ($1.10)           $0.79
------------------------------------------------------------------------

    Today, the Exchange offers Participants two ways to reduce the 
Penny Symbol Customer Taker Fee which is currently $0.40 per contract. 
In note 1 of Options 7, Section 2, the Exchange offers Participants a 
reduced Penny Symbol Customer \3\ Taker Fee of $0.33 per contract, 
instead of $0.40 per contract, in SPDR S&P 500 ETF (``SPY''), Invesco 
QQQ Trust Series 1 (``QQQ'') and iShares Russell 2000 ETF (``IWM''). 
Further, in note 4 of Options 7, Section 2, the Exchange offers 
Participants \4\ that increase their executed Customer volume which 
removes liquidity in a given month by at least 70% above their March 
2024 volume as measured by a percentage of TCV, a Taker Fee discount of 
$0.05 per contract in Penny Symbols, excluding SPY, QQQ, and IWM.\5\
---------------------------------------------------------------------------

    \3\ The term ``Customer'' or (``C'') applies to any transaction 
that is identified by a Participant for clearing in the Customer 
range at The Options Clearing Corporation (``OCC'') which is not for 
the account of broker or dealer or for the account of a 
``Professional'' (as that term is defined in Options 1, Section 
1(a)(48)). See Options 7, Section 1(a).
    \4\ The Exchange proposes to change the word ``Members'' to 
Participants'' in note 4 of Options 7, Section 2 to conform with the 
definition of options participants on BX in Options 1, Section 
1(a)(40).
    \5\ Members with no Customer volume in the remove liquidity 
segment for the month of March 2024 may qualify for the Taker Fee 
discount by having any new volume considered as added volume. The 
note 4 incentive is available through September 30, 2024.
---------------------------------------------------------------------------

    At this time, the Exchange proposes to amend note 1 of Options 7, 
Section 2 to extend the discounted Penny Symbol Customer Taker Fee of 
$0.33 per contract to AAPL, in addition to SPY, QQQ, and IWM. Further, 
the Exchange proposes to exclude AAPL from the Penny Taker Fee discount 
in note 4 of Options 7, Section 2, similar to SPY, QQQ, and IWM. With 
note 4, qualifying Participants pay a Customer Taker Fee of $0.35 per 
contract (instead of $0.40 per contract) in Penny Symbols, however, BX 
excludes SPY, QQQ, and IWM from the note 4 incentive because 
Participants are entitled to a lower Penny Customer Taker Fees of $0.33 
per contract for those symbols per note 1. Penny transactions in AAPL 
that remove liquidity would similarly be entitled to the note 1 
discount, but not the note 4 discount.
    The Exchange believes that the proposed amendments will attract 
additional AAPL Penny transactions that remove liquidity to BX similar 
to SPY, QQQ and IWM.
2. Statutory Basis
    The Exchange believes that its proposal is consistent with Section 
6(b) of the Act,\6\ in general, and furthers the objectives of Sections 
6(b)(4) and 6(b)(5) of the Act,\7\ in particular, in that it provides 
for the equitable allocation of reasonable dues, fees and other charges 
among members and issuers and other persons using any facility, and is 
not designed to permit unfair discrimination between customers, 
issuers, brokers, or dealers.

    \7\ 15 U.S.C. 78f(b)(4) and (5).
---------------------------------------------------------------------------

    BX's proposed changes to its Pricing Schedule are reasonable in 
several respects. As a threshold matter, the Exchange is subject to 
significant competitive forces in the market for options securities 
transaction services that constrain its pricing determinations in that 
market. The fact that this market is competitive has long been 
recognized by the courts. In NetCoalition v. Securities and Exchange 
Commission, the D.C. Circuit stated as follows: ``[n]o one disputes 
that competition for order flow is `fierce.' . . . As the SEC 
explained, `[i]n the U.S. national market system, buyers and sellers of 
securities, and the broker-dealers that act as their order-routing 
agents, have a wide range of choices of where to route orders for 
execution'; [and] `no exchange can afford to take its market share 
percentages for granted' because `no exchange possesses a monopoly, 
regulatory or otherwise, in the execution of order flow from broker 
dealers'. . . .'' \8\
---------------------------------------------------------------------------

    \8\ NetCoalition v. SEC, 615 F.3d 525, 539 (D.C. Cir. 2010) 
(quoting Securities Exchange Act Release No. 59039 (December 2, 
2008), 73 FR 74770, 74782-83 (December 9, 2008) (SR-NYSEArca-2006-
21)).
---------------------------------------------------------------------------

    The Commission and the courts have repeatedly expressed their 
preference for competition over regulatory intervention in determining 
prices, products, and services in the securities markets. In Regulation 
NMS, while adopting a series of steps to improve the current market 
model, the Commission highlighted the importance of market forces in 
determining prices and SRO revenues and, also, recognized that current 
regulation of the market system ``has been remarkably successful in 
promoting market competition in its broader forms that are most 
important to investors and listed companies.'' \9\
---------------------------------------------------------------------------

    \9\ Securities Exchange Act Release No. 51808 (June 9, 2005), 70 
FR 37496, 37499 (June 29, 2005) (``Regulation NMS Adopting 
Release'').
---------------------------------------------------------------------------

    Numerous indicia demonstrate the competitive nature of this market. 
For example, clear substitutes to the Exchange exist in the market for 
options

[[Page 43935]]

security transaction services. The Exchange is only one of seventeen 
options exchanges to which market participants may direct their order 
flow. Within this environment, market participants can freely and often 
do shift their order flow among the Exchange and competing venues in 
response to changes in their respective pricing schedules. As such, the 
proposal represents a reasonable attempt by the Exchange to increase 
its liquidity and market share relative to its competitors.
    The Exchange's proposal to reduce the Penny Symbol Customer Taker 
Fee from $0.40 to $0.33 per contract for trades which remove liquidity 
in AAPL in note 1 of Options 7, Section 2 is reasonable because it will 
attract additional Customer Penny Symbol AAPL transactions that remove 
liquidity to BX. The Exchange believes that it is reasonable to pay 
lower fees in AAPL, similar to SPY, QQQ, and IWM, as compared to other 
options symbols because the Exchange is seeking to incentivize greater 
order flow in these highly liquid Penny Symbols which are subject to 
greater competition among options exchanges.
    The Exchange's proposal to reduce the Penny Symbol Customer Taker 
Fee from $0.40 to $0.33 per contract for trades which remove liquidity 
in AAPL in note 1 of Options 7, Section 2 is equitable and not unfairly 
discriminatory because Customer liquidity enhances market quality on 
the Exchange by providing more trading opportunities, which benefits 
all market participants. Additionally, the Exchange will assess the 
lower Taker Fee in AAPL uniformly to all Customer Penny Symbol Taker 
Fee transactions similar to SPY, QQQ and IWM.
    The Exchange's proposal to exclude AAPL Penny transactions that 
remove liquidity from note 4 of Options 7, Section 2 is reasonable 
because with the proposed change to note 1 of Options 7, Section 2, 
Participants would be entitled to a lower Penny Customer Taker Fee of 
$0.33 per contract in AAPL.
    The Exchange's proposal to exclude AAPL Penny transactions that 
remove liquidity from note 4 of Options 7, Section 2 is equitable and 
not unfairly discriminatory because the Exchange would not permit any 
transaction to remove liquidity in AAPL in Penny Symbols to receive the 
discount in note 4 of Options 7, Section 2.

B. Self-Regulatory Organization's Statement on Burden on Competition

    The Exchange does not believe that the proposed rule change will 
impose any burden on competition not necessary or appropriate in 
furtherance of the purposes of the Act.
    In terms of intra-market competition, the Exchange does not believe 
that its proposal will place any category of market participant at a 
competitive disadvantage. The Exchange's proposal to reduce the Penny 
Symbol Customer Taker Fee from $0.40 to $0.33 per contract for trades 
which remove liquidity in AAPL in note 1 of Options 7, Section 2 does 
not impose an undue burden on competition because Customer liquidity 
enhances market quality on the Exchange by providing more trading 
opportunities, which benefits all market participants. Additionally, 
the Exchange will assess the lower Taker Fee in AAPL uniformly to all 
Customer Penny Symbol Taker Fee transactions similar to SPY, QQQ and 
IWM. Also, the Exchange's proposal to exclude AAPL Penny transactions 
that remove liquidity from note 4 of Options 7, Section 2 does not 
impose an undue burden on competition because the Exchange would not 
permit any transaction to remove liquidity in AAPL in Penny Symbols to 
receive the discount in note 4 of Options 7, Section 2.
    In terms of inter-market competition, the Exchange notes that it 
operates in a highly competitive market in which market participants 
can readily favor competing venues if they deem fee levels at a 
particular venue to be excessive, or rebate opportunities available at 
other venues to be more favorable. In such an environment, the Exchange 
must continually adjust its fees to remain competitive with other 
options exchanges. Because competitors are free to modify their own 
fees in response, and because market participants may readily adjust 
their order routing practices, the Exchange believes that the degree to 
which fee changes in this market may impose any burden on competition 
is extremely limited. In sum, if the changes proposed herein are 
unattractive to market participants, it is likely that the Exchange 
will lose market share as a result. Accordingly, the Exchange does not 
believe that the proposed changes will impair the ability of members or 
competing order execution venues to maintain their competitive standing 
in the financial markets.

Rule Change Received From Members, Participants, or Others
