Background

    On June 26, 2001, the President, invoking the authority of, inter 
alia, the International Emergency Economic Powers Act (50 U.S.C. 1701-
1706) (``IEEPA''), issued Executive Order 13219 (66 Fed.Reg. 34777, 
June 29, 2001) (``E.O. 13219''). In E.O. 13219, the President declared 
a national emergency with respect to the actions of persons engaged in, 
or assisting, sponsoring, or supporting: (i) Extremist violence in the 
former Yugoslav Republic of Macedonia, southern Serbia, the Federal 
Republic of Yugoslavia, and elsewhere in the Western Balkans region, or 
(ii) acts obstructing implementation of the Dayton Accords in Bosnia or 
United Nations Security Council Resolution 1244 in Kosovo.
    On May 28, 2003, the President issued Executive Order 13304 (68 FR 
32315, May 29, 2003) (``E.O. 13304'') terminating the national 
emergencies declared in Executive Order 12808 of May 20, 1992, and 
Executive Order 13088 of June 9, 1998, with respect to the former 
Socialist Federal Republic of Yugoslavia, revoking those and related 
executive orders, and taking additional steps with regard to the 
national emergency declared in E.O. 13219. Section 1 of E.O. 13219, as 
amended by E.O. 13304, blocks, with certain exceptions, all property 
and interests in property that are in the United States, or that 
hereafter come within the United States, or that are or hereafter come 
within the possession or control of United States persons, of: (i) 
Persons listed in the Annex to E.O. 13304 and (ii) persons designated 
by the Secretary of the Treasury, in consultation with the Secretary of 
State, because they are determined: (A) To be under open indictment by 
the International Criminal Tribunal for the former Yugoslavia, unless 
circumstances warrant otherwise, or (B) to have committed, or to pose a 
significant risk of committing, acts of violence that have the purpose 
or effect of threatening the peace in or diminishing the stability or 
security of any area or state in the Western Balkans region, 
undermining the authority, efforts, or objectives of international 
organizations or entities present in the region, or endangering the 
safety of persons participating in or providing support to the 
activities of those international organizations or entities; or (C) to 
have actively obstructed, or pose a significant risk of actively 
obstructing, the Ohrid Framework Agreement of 2001 relating to 
Macedonia, United Nations Security Council Resolution 1244 relating to 
Kosovo, or the Dayton Accords or the Conclusions of the Peace 
Implementation Conference held in London on December 8-9, 1995, 
including the decisions or conclusions of the High Representative, the 
Peace Implementation Council or its Steering Board, relating to Bosnia 
and Herzegovina; or (D) to have materially assisted in, sponsored, or 
provided financial, material, or technological support for, or goods or 
services in support of, such acts of violence or obstructionism or any 
person listed in or designated pursuant to this order; or (E) to be 
owned or controlled by, or acting or purporting to act directly or 
indirectly for or on behalf of, any of the foregoing persons.
    On June 22, 2010, the Director of OFAC removed from the SDN List 
the individual listed below, whose property and interests in property 
were blocked pursuant to E.O. 13219, as amended by E.O. 13304:

Montenegro; ICTY indictee (individual) [BALKANS].
