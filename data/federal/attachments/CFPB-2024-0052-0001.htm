SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION: 
    Title of Collection: Consumer Leasing Act (Regulation M).
    OMB Control Number: 3170-0006.
    Type of Review: Extension without change of a currently approved 
collection.
    Affected Public: Businesses and other for-profit entities.
    Estimated Number of Respondents: 13,301.
    Estimated Total Annual Burden Hours: 2,062.
    Abstract: Consumers rely on the disclosures required by the 
Consumer Leasing Act (CLA) \1\ and Regulation M \2\ for information to 
comparison shop among leases as well as to ascertain the true costs and 
terms of lease offers. Federal/State enforcement and private litigants 
use the records to ascertain whether accurate and complete disclosures 
of the cost of leases have been provided to consumers prior to 
consummation of the lease. This information provides the primary 
evidence of law violations in CLA enforcement actions brought by 
Federal agencies. The agency's ability to enforce the CLA would be 
significantly impaired without Regulation M's recordkeeping 
requirements.

in response to this notice will be reviewed by OMB as part of its 
review of this request. All comments will become a matter of public 
record.
