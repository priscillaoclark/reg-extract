SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION: The Regulatory Flexibility Act (``RFA''), 
codified at 5 U.S.C. 601-612, requires an agency to review its rules 
that have a significant economic impact upon a substantial number of 
small entities within ten years of the publication of such rules as 
final rules. 5 U.S.C. 610(a). The purpose of the review is ``to 
determine whether such rules should be continued without change, or 
should be

[[Page 99176]]

amended or rescinded . . . to minimize any significant economic impact 
of the rules upon a substantial number of such small entities.'' 5 
U.S.C. 610(a). The RFA sets forth specific considerations that must be 
addressed in the review of each rule:
    <bullet> the continued need for the rule;
    <bullet> the nature of complaints or comments received concerning 
the rule from the public;
    <bullet> the complexity of the rule;
    <bullet> the extent to which the rule overlaps, duplicates or 
conflicts with other federal rules, and, to the extent feasible, with 
state and local governmental rules; and
    <bullet> the length of time since the rule has been evaluated or 
the degree to which technology, economic conditions, or other factors 
have changed in the area affected by the rule. 5 U.S.C. 610(b).
    The list below includes rules adopted in 2015 that may have a 
significant economic impact on a substantial number of small entities 
(but excludes rules that have been substantially changed since 
adoption, rules that are minor amendments to previously adopted rules, 
and rules that are ministerial, procedural, or technical in nature). 
Where the Commission has previously made a determination of a rule's 
impact on small businesses, the determination is noted on the list.
    The Commission particularly solicits public comment on whether the 
rules listed below affect small businesses in new or different ways 
than when they were first adopted. The rules and forms listed below are 
scheduled for review by staff of the Commission.

    Description: The Securities and Exchange Commission adopted new 
Regulation Crowdfunding under the Securities Act of 1933 and the 
Securities Exchange Act of 1934 to implement the requirements of Title 
III of the Jumpstart Our Business Startups Act. Regulation Crowdfunding 
prescribes rules governing the offer and sale of securities under new 
Section 4(a)(6) of the Securities Act of 1933. Regulation Crowdfunding 
also provides a framework for the regulation of registered funding 
portals and broker-dealers that issuers are required to use as 
intermediaries in the offer and sale of securities in reliance on 
Section 4(a)(6). In addition, Regulation Crowdfunding conditionally 
exempts securities sold pursuant to Section 4(a)(6) from the 
registration requirements of Section 12(g) of the Securities Exchange 
Act of 1934.
    Prior RFA Analysis: When the Commission adopted the rule on October 
30, 2015, it published a Final Regulatory Flexibility Analysis in the 
adopting release, Release Nos. 33-9974/34-76324, available at: <a href="https://www.federalregister.gov/documents/2015/11/16/2015-28220/crowdfunding">https://www.federalregister.gov/documents/2015/11/16/2015-28220/crowdfunding</a>. 
The Commission solicited comment on its Initial Regulatory Flexibility 
Analysis published in the proposing release, Release Nos. 33-9470/34-
70741 (Oct. 23, 2013), available at: <a href="https://www.federalregister.gov/documents/2013/11/05/2013-25355/crowdfunding">https://www.federalregister.gov/documents/2013/11/05/2013-25355/crowdfunding</a>, and considered comments

    Description: The Commission adopted amendments to Regulation A and 
other rules and forms to implement Section 401 of the Jumpstart Our 
Business Startups (JOBS) Act. Section 401 of the JOBS Act added Section 
3(b)(2) to the Securities Act of 1933, which directs the Commission to 
adopt rules exempting from the registration requirements of the 
Securities Act offerings of up to $50 million of securities annually. 
The final rules include issuer eligibility requirements, content and 
filing requirements for offering statements, and ongoing reporting 
requirements for issuers in Regulation A offerings.
