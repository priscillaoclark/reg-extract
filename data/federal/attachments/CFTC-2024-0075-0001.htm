Control No. 3038-0086.

SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION: Under the PRA, 44 U.S.C. 3501 et seq., 
Federal agencies must obtain approval from the Office of Management and 
Budget (OMB) for each collection of information they conduct or 
sponsor. ``Collection of Information'' is defined in 44 U.S.C. 3502(3) 
and 5 CFR 1320.3 and includes agency requests or requirements that 
members of the public submit reports, keep records, or provide 
information to a third party. Section 3506(c)(2)(A) of the PRA, 44 
U.S.C. 3506(c)(2)(A), requires Federal agencies to provide a 60-day 
notice in the Federal Register concerning each proposed collection of 
information, including each proposed extension of an existing 
collection of information, before submitting the collection to OMB for 
approval. To comply with this requirement, the CFTC is publishing 
notice of the proposed collection of information listed below. An 
agency may not conduct or sponsor, and a person is not required to 
respond to, a collection of information unless it displays a currently 
valid OMB control number.
    Title: Swap Data Repositories; Registration and Regulatory 
Requirements (OMB Control No. 3038-0086). This is a request for 
extension of a currently approved information collection.
    Abstract: Section 728 of the Dodd-Frank Wall Street Reform and 
Consumer Protection Act, Public Law 111-203, 124 Stat. 1376 (2010), 
specifically requires the CFTC to establish certain standards for the 
governance, registration, and statutory duties applicable to SDRs. The 
CFTC established these standards in part 49 of the CFTC's regulations.
    With respect to the collection of information, the CFTC invites 
comments on:
    <bullet> Whether the proposed collection of information is 
necessary for the proper performance of the functions of the 
Commission, including whether the information will have a practical 
use;
    <bullet> The accuracy of the Commission's estimate of the burden of 
the proposed collection of information, including the validity of the 
methodology and assumptions used;
    <bullet> Ways to enhance the quality, usefulness, and clarity of 
the information to be collected; and
    <bullet> Ways to minimize the burden of collection of information 
on those who are to respond, including through the use of appropriate 
automated electronic, mechanical, or other technological collection 
techniques or other forms of information technology; e.g., permitting 
electronic submission of responses.
    All comments must be submitted in English, or if not, accompanied 
by an English translation. Comments will be posted as received to 
<a href="https://www.cftc.gov">https://www.cftc.gov</a>. You should submit only information that you wish 
to make available publicly. If you wish the Commission to consider 
information that you believe is exempt from disclosure under the 
Freedom of Information Act, a petition for confidential treatment of 
the exempt information may be submitted according to the procedures 
established in Sec.  145.9 of the Commission's regulations.\1\
---------------------------------------------------------------------------

    \1\ 17 CFR 145.9.
---------------------------------------------------------------------------

    The Commission reserves the right, but shall have no obligation, to 
review, pre-screen, filter, redact, refuse or remove any or all of your 
submission from <a href="https://www.cftc.gov">https://www.cftc.gov</a> that it may deem to be 
inappropriate for publication, such as obscene language. All 
submissions that have been redacted or removed that contain comments on 
the merits of the ICR will be retained in the public comment file and 
will be considered as required under the Administrative Procedure Act 
and other applicable laws, and may be accessible under the Freedom of 
Information Act.
    Burden Statement: The Commission is revising its estimate of the 
burden for this collection for Swap Data Repositories (SDRs). The 
respondent burden for this collection is estimated to be as follows:
    Estimated Number of Respondents: 4.
    Estimated Average Burden Hours per Respondent: 19,679.5.
    Estimated Total Annual Burden Hours: 78,718.
    Frequency of Collection: Annual and occasional.
    There are no start-up costs associated with this collection and an 
average of $2 million in ongoing operating costs per respondent.

(Authority: 44 U.S.C. 3501 et seq.)

    Dated: September 30, 2024.
Robert Sidman,
Deputy Secretary of the Commission.
