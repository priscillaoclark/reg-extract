No. 3038-0101.

SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION: 
    Title: Registration of Foreign Boards of Trade (OMB Control No. 
3038-0101). This is a request for extension of a currently approved 
information collection.
    Abstract: Section 738 of the Dodd-Frank Act amended section 4(b) of 
the Commodity Exchange Act to provide that the Commission may adopt 
rules and regulations requiring foreign boards of trade (FBOT) that 
wish to provide their members or other participants located in the 
United States with direct access to the FBOT's electronic trading and 
order matching system to register with the Commission. Pursuant to this 
authorization, the CFTC adopted a final rule requiring FBOTs that wish 
to permit trading by direct access to provide certain information to 
the Commission in applications for registration and, once registered, 
to provide certain information to meet quarterly and annual reporting 
requirements. Currently, Part 48 of the Commission's regulations sets 
forth reporting and/or recordkeeping requirements to ensure registered 
FBOTs providing for trading by direct access meet statutory and 
regulatory requirements on an initial and ongoing basis.
    An agency may not conduct or sponsor, and a person is not required 
to respond to, a collection of information unless it displays a 
currently valid OMB control number. On January 13, 2023, the Commission 
published in the Federal Register notice of the proposed extension of 
this information collection and provided 60 days for public comment on 
the proposed extension, 88 FR 2345 (``60-Day Notice''). The Commission 
did not receive any relevant comments on the 60-Day Notice.
    Burden Statement: The Commission is revising its estimate of the 
burden for this collection for registered FBOTs, by increasing the 
number of FBOTs to which the burden applies from 23 to 24 FBOTs. The 
respondent burden for this collection is estimated to be as follows:
    Estimated Number of Respondents: 24.
    Estimated Average Burden Hours per Respondent: 360 and \1/3\ hours.
    Estimated Total Annual Burden Hours: 8,648 hours.
    Frequency of Collection: When a reportable event occurs and 
quarterly and annually for required reports.

    There are no capital costs or operating and maintenance costs 
associated with this collection.
    Authority: 44 U.S.C. 3501 et seq.

    Dated: April 20, 2023.
Robert Sidman,
Deputy Secretary of the Commission.
