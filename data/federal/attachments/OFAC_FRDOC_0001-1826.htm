DEPARTMENT OF THE TREASURY

Office of Foreign Assets Control

31 CFR Parts 501, 510, 535, 536, 547, 548, 551, 552, 553, 558, 561, 
566, 570, 578, 588, 589, 590, 592, 594, 597, 598


Updating Contact Information and Grammatical Terminology in OFAC 
Regulations

AGENCY: Office of Foreign Assets Control, Treasury.

ACTION: Final rule.

-----------------------------------------------------------------------

SUMMARY: The Department of the Treasury's Office of Foreign Assets 
Control (OFAC) is adopting a final rule to update contact information 
and grammatical terminology in existing regulations.

DATES: This rule is effective March 5, 2024.

FOR FURTHER INFORMATION CONTACT: OFAC: Assistant Director for 
Licensing, 202-622-2480; Assistant Director for Regulatory Affairs, 
202-622-4855; or Assistant Director for Compliance, 202-622-2490.

SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION:

Electronic Availability

    This document and additional information concerning OFAC are 
available on OFAC's website: <a href="https://ofac.treasury.gov">https://ofac.treasury.gov</a>.

Background

    In this document, OFAC is updating 20 parts of 31 CFR Chapter V and 
an Appendix to update the name of an OFAC office and an email address 
and is updating two parts to remove options for mail submissions. OFAC 
is also amending four parts to make gender language more inclusive, 
replacing instances of ``his'' (when not part of the phrase ``his or 
hers'') with ``theirs,'' and replacing ``he'' (when not part of the 
phrase ``he or she'') with ``they.'' Finally, OFAC is making changes in 
the authorities citations of 31 CFR part 594 and an Appendix to more 
specifically reference the relevant statutory authorities in each 
citation.

Public Participation

    Because the amendment of the Regulations is a rule of agency 
procedure and because it involves a foreign affairs function, the 
provisions of E.O. 12866 of September 30, 1993, ``Regulatory Planning 
and Review'' (58 FR 51735, October 4, 1993), as amended, and the 
Administrative Procedure Act (5 U.S.C. 553) requiring notice of 
proposed rulemaking, opportunity for public participation, and delay in 
effective date are inapplicable. Because no notice of proposed 
rulemaking is required for this rule, the Regulatory Flexibility Act (5 
U.S.C. 601-612) does not apply.

Paperwork Reduction Act

    The collections of information related to the regulations being 
amended in this rule are contained in 31 CFR part 501 (the ``Reporting, 
Procedures and Penalties Regulations''). Pursuant to the Paperwork 
Reduction Act of 1995 (44 U.S.C. 3507), those collections of 
information have been approved by the Office of Management and Budget 
under control number 1505-0164. An agency may not conduct or sponsor, 
and a person is not required to respond to, a collection of information 
unless the collection of information displays a valid control number.

List of Subjects in 31 CFR Parts 501, 510, 535, 536, 547, 548, 551, 
552, 553, 558, 561, 566, 570, 578, 588, 589, 590, 592, 594, 597, 
598

    Administrative practice and procedure, Banks, banking, Blocking of 
assets, Credit, Foreign trade, Penalties, Reporting and recordkeeping

following amendments:
