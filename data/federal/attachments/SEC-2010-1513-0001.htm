    Pursuant to Section 19(b)(1) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 
(the ``Act'') \1\ and Rule 19b-4 thereunder,\2\ notice is hereby given 
that on September 22, 2010, the Chicago Board Options Exchange, 
Incorporated (the ``Exchange'' or ``CBOE'') filed with the Securities 
and Exchange Commission (the ``Commission'') the proposed rule change 
as described in Items I, II, and III below, which Items have been 
prepared by the Exchange. The Commission is publishing this notice to

    \2\ 17 CFR 240.19b-4.
---------------------------------------------------------------------------

I. Self-Regulatory Organization's Statement of the Terms of Substance 
of the Proposed Rule Change

    The Exchange proposes to modify the Fees Schedule for its CBOE 
Stock Exchange (``CBSX''). The text of the proposed rule change is 
available on the Exchange's Web site (<A HREF="http://frwebgate.access.gpo.gov/cgi-bin/leaving.cgi?from=leavingFR.html&log=linklog&to=http://www.cboe.org/legal">http://www.cboe.org/legal</A>), at 
the Exchange's principal office, and at the Commission's Public 
Reference Room.

II. Self-Regulatory Organization's Statement of the Purpose of, and 
Statutory Basis for, the Proposed Rule Change

    In its filing with the Commission, the self-regulatory organization 
included statements concerning the purpose of and basis for the 
proposed rule change and discussed any comments it received on the 
proposed rule change. The text of those statements may be examined at 
the places specified in Item IV below. The Exchange has prepared 
summaries, set forth in sections A, B, and C below, of the most 
significant parts of such statements.

A. Self-Regulatory Organization's Statement of the Purpose of, and the 
Statutory Basis for, the Proposed Rule Change

1. Purpose
    On August 23, 2010, the Commission published an immediately 
effective rule filing to modify the transaction fees for 24 securities 
currently traded on CBSX (the following symbols: BAC, C, DXD, EMC, EWJ, 
F, FAX, FAZ, GE, INTC, MOT, MSFT, MU, NOK, Q, QID, S, SIRI, SKF, T, 
TWM, UNG, UWM, XLF).\3\ On September 9, 2010, the Commission published 
an immediately effective rule filing to modify the transaction fees for 
51 more securities currently traded on CBSX (the following symbols: AA, 
AMAT, AMD, BGZ, BP, BSX, CMCSA, COCO, CSCO, CX, DELL, DUK, EBAY, EEM, 
EWT, FAS, FLEX, HBAN, IYR, MDT, MGM, IYR, MDT, MGM, NLY, NVDA, NWSA, 
ORCL, PFE, QCOM, QQQQ, SBUX, SH, SLV, SMH, SSO, SYMC, TBT, TSM, TXN, 
UCO, USO, VALE, VWO, WFC, XHB, XLB, XLK, XLP, XLU, XLV, XLY, XRX, 
YHOO).\4\ The Exchange now proposes to add 50 more securities to that 
list of securities (the following symbols: ARNA, ATML, BKC, BRCD, CIM, 
DOW, DRYS, EFA, EWZ, FITB, FXI, GBG, GDX, GLD, GLW, HPQ, IDIX, IWM, 
JPM, KEY, LVLT, LVS, MFE, MO, MRVL, ONNN, PBR, PCBC, QLD, RF, RFMD, 
RIMM, RRI, RSCR, SDS, SNDK, SPLS, SPY, TEVA, TLT, TNA, TZA, UYG, VXX, 
VZ, X, XLE, XLI, XOM, XRT).
---------------------------------------------------------------------------

    \3\ See Securities Exchange Act Release No. 34-62758 (August 23, 
2010), 75 FR 166 (August 27, 2010) (SR-CBOE-2010-075).
    \4\ See Securities Exchange Act Release No. 34-62878 (September 
9, 2010), 75 FR 179 (September 16, 2010) (SR-CBOE-2010-079).
---------------------------------------------------------------------------

    For those securities already approved for the new transaction fees 
as well as those that would be added by this proposed rule change, 
assuming their prices do not drop below $1, the takers of liquidity 
will receive a $0.0014 per share rebate, and makers of liquidity

[[Page 61550]]

will incur a $0.0018 charge. The new pricing strategy is designed to 
incent order routing behavior that selects CBSX as the first 
destination. By offering customers a significant rebate to ``remove'' 
liquidity, the Exchange will offer overall economic benefits far above 
those received at other markets.
    The proposed rule change also moves the list of securities subject 
to these rates from the chart of rates into footnotes, as the expanded 
list had made the chart cumbersome. The changes will take effect on 
October 1, 2010.
2. Statutory Basis
    The proposed rule change is consistent with Section 6(b) of the 
Securities Exchange Act of 1934 (``Act''),\5\ in general, and furthers 
the objectives of Section 6(b)(4) \6\ of the Act in particular, in that 
it is designed to provide for the equitable allocation of reasonable 
dues, fees, and other charges among CBOE members and other persons 
using its facilities.

B. Self-Regulatory Organization's Statement on Burden on Competition
---------------------------------------------------------------------------

    \5\ 15 U.S.C. 78f(b).
    \6\ 15 U.S.C. 78f(b)(4).
---------------------------------------------------------------------------

    CBOE does not believe that the proposed rule change will impose any 
burden on competition not necessary or appropriate in furtherance of 
the purposes of the Act.

C. Self-Regulatory Organization's Statement on Comments on the Proposed 
Rule Change Received From Members, Participants, or Others

    No written comments were solicited or received with respect to the 
proposed rule change.

III. Date of Effectiveness of the Proposed Rule Change and Timing for 
Commission Action

    The proposed rule change is designated by the Exchange as 
establishing or changing a due, fee, or other charge, thereby 
qualifying for effectiveness on filing pursuant to Section 
19(b)(3)(A)(ii) \7\ of the Act and subparagraph (f)(2) of Rule 19b-4 
\8\ thereunder.
---------------------------------------------------------------------------

    \7\ 15 U.S.C. 78s(b)(3)(A)(ii).
    \8\ 17 CFR 240.19b-4(f)(2).
---------------------------------------------------------------------------

    At any time within 60 days of the filing of the proposed rule 
change, the Commission summarily may temporarily suspend such rule 
change if it appears to the Commission that such action is necessary or 
appropriate in the public interest, for the protection of investors, or 
otherwise in furtherance of the purposes of the Act.

IV. Solicitation of Comments
