SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION: 
    Titles and Form Number: EIB 92-51 Application for Special Buyer 
Credit Limit (SBCL) Under Multi-Buyer Export Credit Insurance Policies.
    OMB Number: 3048-0015.
    Type of Review: Regular.
    Need and Use: This application provides EXIM Bank with the credit 
information on a foreign buyer credit limit request needed to make a 
determination of eligibility for EXIM Bank support in adherence to 
legislatively required reasonable reassurance of repayment and other 
statutory requirements.
    The changes to this form are intended to improve the sequence and 
layout of the foreign buyer credit questions and add description of the 
drop-down menus.
    Affected Public: This form affects business entities involved in 
the export of U.S. goods and services. The estimated number of 
respondents and the annual hour burden has been lowered to only count 
the new applicants. The estimate of the overall burden to the public 
has been reduced after considering that EXIM automatically processes 
renewals of Special Buyer Credit Limit requests in the Exim Online 
(EOL) system, and, thus, the renewing policyholders don't have to 
manually complete an application.
