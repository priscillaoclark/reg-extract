    <bullet> Settlement Cycle Report of Dealer Fails and Transaction 
Volumes (FR 2004FM).
    The Federal Reserve Bank of New York, on behalf of the Federal 
Reserve System, collects data from primary dealers in the U.S. 
Government securities market. Filing of these data is required to 
obtain the benefit of primary dealer status. The Federal Reserve uses 
these data to (1) monitor the condition of the U.S. Government 
securities market in its Treasury market surveillance and analysis of 
the market and (2) assist and support the U.S. Department of the 
Treasury (Treasury) in its role as fiscal agent for Treasury financing 
operations. In addition, these data are used in the analysis of broad 
financial conditions and a range of financial stability issues.
    Frequency: Weekly, monthly, daily, and event-generated.
    Respondents: Primary Government security dealers.
    Total estimated number of respondents: 24.
    Total estimated change in burden: 1,310.
    Total estimated annual burden hours: 35,189.
    Current actions: On January 29, 2024, the Board published a notice 
in the Federal Register (89 FR 5539) requesting public comment for 60 
days on the extension, with revision, of the FR 2004. Since the last 
clearance, a new type of repo financing called ``sponsored general 
collateral repo'' has gained significant popularity among clients of 
primary dealers. Such type of financing is not separately listed in the 
current FR 2004C. To improve our ability to track the usage of this 
product by primary dealers, the Board proposed to revise the FR 2004C 
for each asset category by adding three columns to separately capture 
sponsored general collateral Triparty Repo financing by maturity 
tenors. The comment period for this notice expired on March 29, 2024. 
The Board received one comment from a financial services group. The 
commenter stated that the proposed June 5, 2024, implementation date 
conflicted with the T-1 go live and competed with limited IT resources. 
After consideration, the Board will extend the implementation date to 
July 3, 2024. Aside from the change discussed above, the Board adopted 
the extension, with revision, of the FR 2004 as originally proposed.

    Board of Governors of the Federal Reserve System, June 4, 2024.
Benjamin W. McDonough,
Deputy Secretary and Ombuds of the Board.
