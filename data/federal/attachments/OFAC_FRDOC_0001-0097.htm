Background

    On September 23, 2001, the President issued Executive Order 13224

1945, 22 U.S.C. 287c, imposing economic sanctions on persons who 
commit, threaten to commit, or support acts of terrorism. The President 
identified in the Annex to the Order various individuals and entities 
as subject to the economic sanctions. The Order authorizes the 
Secretary of the Treasury, in consultation with the Secretary of State, 
the Attorney General, and (pursuant to Executive Order 13284) the 
Secretary of the Department of Homeland Security, to designate 
additional individuals or entities determined to meet certain criteria 
set forth in Executive Order 13224.
    Two such additional entities were designated by the Secretary of 
the Treasury on November 7, 2001 and one additional individual was 
designated by the Secretary of the Treasury on January 22, 2003. The 
Department of the Treasury's Office of Foreign Assets Control has 
determined that the two entities and one individual should be removed 
from the list of Specially Designated Nationals and Blocked Persons.

    The removal of the two entities' and individual's names from the
