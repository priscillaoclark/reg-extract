Substantive Technical Changes to Certain FINRA Rules

September 23, 2010.
    Pursuant to Section 19(b)(1) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 
(``Act'') \1\ and Rule 19b-4 thereunder,\2\ notice is hereby given that 
on September 13, 2010, Financial Industry Regulatory Authority, Inc. 
(``FINRA'') filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission (``SEC'' 
or ``Commission'') the proposed rule change as described in Items I and 
II below, which Items have been prepared by FINRA. FINRA has designated 
the proposed rule change as constituting a ``non-controversial'' rule 
change under paragraph (f)(6) of Rule 19b-4 under the Act,\3\ which 
renders the proposal effective upon receipt of this filing by the 
Commission. The Commission is publishing this notice to solicit 
comments on the proposed rule change from interested persons.

I. Self-Regulatory Organization's Statement of the Terms of Substance 
of the Proposed Rule Change

    FINRA is proposing to update cross-references within certain FINRA 
rules to reflect changes adopted in the consolidated FINRA rulebook and 
to make non-substantive technical changes to certain FINRA Rules.
    The text of the proposed rule change is available on FINRA's Web 
site at <A HREF="http://frwebgate.access.gpo.gov/cgi-bin/leaving.cgi?from=leavingFR.html&log=linklog&to=http://www.finra.org">http://www.finra.org</A>, at the principal office of FINRA and at 
the Commission's Public Reference Room.

II. Self-Regulatory Organization's Statement of the Purpose of, and 
Statutory Basis for, the Proposed Rule Change

    In its filing with the Commission, FINRA included statements 
concerning the purpose of and basis for the proposed rule change and 
discussed any comments it received on the proposed rule change. The 
text of these statements may be examined at the places specified in 
Item IV below. FINRA has prepared summaries, set forth in sections A, 
B, and C below, of the most significant aspects of such statements.

A. Self-Regulatory Organization's Statement of the Purpose of, and 
Statutory Basis for, the Proposed Rule Change

1. Purpose
    FINRA is in the process of developing a new consolidated rulebook 
(``Consolidated FINRA Rulebook'').\4\ That process involves FINRA 
submitting to the Commission for approval a series of proposed rule 
changes over time to adopt rules in the Consolidated FINRA Rulebook. 
The phased adoption and implementation of those rules necessitates 
periodic amendments to update rule cross-references and other non-
substantive technical changes in the Consolidated FINRA Rulebook.
---------------------------------------------------------------------------

    \4\ The current FINRA rulebook consists of (1) FINRA Rules; (2) 
NASD Rules; and (3) rules incorporated from NYSE (``Incorporated 
NYSE Rules'') (together, the NASD Rules and Incorporated NYSE Rules 
are referred to as the ``Transitional Rulebook''). While the NASD 
Rules generally apply to all FINRA members, the Incorporated NYSE 
Rules apply only to those members of FINRA that are also members of 
the NYSE (``Dual Members''). The FINRA Rules apply to all FINRA 
members, unless such rules have a more limited application by their 
terms. For more information about the rulebook consolidation 
process, see Information Notice, March 12, 2008 (Rulebook 
Consolidation Process).
---------------------------------------------------------------------------

    The proposed rule change would update rule cross-references to 
reflect recent changes adopted in the Consolidated FINRA Rulebook. In 
this regard, the proposed rule change would update references in FINRA 
Rules 6630 and 9610 to reflect the adoption into the Consolidated FINRA 
Rulebook of FINRA Rule 4320 and the deletion of NASD Rule 3210.\5\
---------------------------------------------------------------------------

    \5\ See Securities Exchange Act Release No. 62533 (July 20, 
2010), 75 FR 43588 (July 26, 2010) (Order Approving File No. SR-
FINRA-2010-028).
---------------------------------------------------------------------------

    In addition, at the request of SEC staff, the proposed rule change 
would make technical amendments to FINRA Rules 5110, 6432 and 6540. The 
proposed rule change would replace references to the SEC's Interactive 
Data Electronic Applications (``IDEA'') with the term ``Electronic Data 
Gathering, Analysis, and Retrieval (`EDGAR').''
    Finally, the proposed rule change would correct an inaccurate 
cross-reference in FINRA Rule 9810. In 2008, in connection with 
updating cross-references in that rule, FINRA inadvertently replaced a 
reference to NASD Rule 2110 with FINRA Rule 2020 rather than FINRA Rule 
2010.\6\ The proposed rule change would correct that technical error.
---------------------------------------------------------------------------

    \6\ See Securities Exchange Act Release No. 59057 (December 12, 
2008), 73 FR 78412 (December 22, 2008) (Notice of Filing and 
Immediate Effectiveness of File No. SR-FINRA-2008-057).
---------------------------------------------------------------------------

    FINRA has filed the proposed rule change for immediate 
effectiveness. The implementation date for the proposed rule change 
will be October 15, 2010, the date on which the previously approved 
rule change regarding FINRA Rule 4320 will be implemented.\7\
---------------------------------------------------------------------------

    \7\ See Regulatory Notice 10-35 (August 2010).
---------------------------------------------------------------------------

2. Statutory Basis
    FINRA believes that the proposed rule change is consistent with the 
provisions of Section 15A(b)(6) of the Act,\8\ which requires, among 
other things, that FINRA rules must be designed to prevent fraudulent 
and manipulative acts and practices, to promote just and equitable 
principles of trade, and, in general, to protect investors and the 
public interest. FINRA believes the proposed rule change will provide 
greater clarity to members and the public regarding FINRA's rules.
---------------------------------------------------------------------------

    \8\ 15 U.S.C. 78o-3(b)(6).
---------------------------------------------------------------------------

B. Self-Regulatory Organization's Statement on Burden on Competition

    FINRA does not believe that the proposed rule change will result in 
any burden on competition that is not necessary or appropriate in 
furtherance of the purposes of the Act.

C. Self-Regulatory Organization's Statement on Comments on the Proposed 
Rule Change Received From Members, Participants, or Others

    Written comments were neither solicited nor received.

III. Date of Effectiveness of the Proposed Rule Change and Timing for 
Commission Action

    Because the foregoing proposed rule change does not: (i) 
Significantly affect the protection of investors or the public 
interest; (ii) impose any significant burden on competition; and (iii) 
become operative for 30 days from the date on which it was filed, or 
such shorter time as the Commission may designate, it has

[[Page 60158]]

become effective pursuant to Section 19(b)(3)(A) of the Act \9\ and 
Rule 19b-4(f)(6) thereunder.\10\
---------------------------------------------------------------------------

    \9\ 15 U.S.C. 78s(b)(3)(A).
    \10\ 17 CFR 240.19b-4(f)(6).
---------------------------------------------------------------------------

    At any time within 60 days of the filing of the proposed rule 
change, the Commission summarily may temporarily suspend such rule 
change if it appears to the Commission that such action is necessary or 
appropriate in the public interest, for the protection of investors, or 
otherwise in furtherance of the purposes of the Act.

IV. Solicitation of Comments
