II. Self-Regulatory Organization's Statement of the Purpose of, and 
Statutory Basis for, the Proposed Rule Change

    In its filing with the Commission, FINRA included statements 
concerning the purpose of and basis for the proposed rule change and 
discussed any comments it received on the proposed rule change. The 
text of these statements may be examined at the places specified in 
Item IV below. FINRA has prepared summaries, set forth in sections A, 
B, and C below, of the most significant aspects of such statements.

A. Self-Regulatory Organization's Statement of the Purpose of, and the 
Statutory Basis for, the Proposed Rule Change

1. Purpose
Background
    In October 1993, the Commission adopted Exchange Act Rule 15c6-1 to 
shorten the standard U.S. trade settlement cycle for most securities 
transactions from five business days after the trade date (``T+5'') to 
three business days after the trade date (``T+3'').\5\ In March 2017, 
the Commission amended Exchange Act Rule 15c6-1 to further shorten the 
trade settlement cycle from T+3 to T+2.\6\ On both occasions, FINRA 
amended its settlement-related rules to conform to the Commission's 
changes to the trade settlement cycle.\7\
---------------------------------------------------------------------------

    \5\ See Securities Exchange Act Release No. 33023 (October 6, 
1993), 58 FR 52891 (October 13, 1993) (File No. S7-5-93). The 
implementation date of Exchange Act Rule 15c6-1 was June 7, 1995. 
See Securities Exchange Act Release No. 34592 (November 9, 1994), 59 
FR 59137 (November 16, 1994) (File No. S7-5-93). When adopted, 
Exchange Act Rule 15c6-1 prohibited broker-dealers from effecting or 
entering into a contract for the purchase or sale of a security 
(other than an exempted security, government security, municipal 
security, commercial paper, bankers' acceptances, or commercial 
bills) that provides for payment of funds and delivery of securities 
later than the third business day after the date of the contract 
unless otherwise expressly agreed to by the parties at the time of 
the transaction. Although not covered by Exchange Act Rule 15c6-1, 
in 1995, the Commission approved the Municipal Securities Rulemaking 
Board's (``MSRB'') rule change requiring transactions in municipal 
securities to settle by T+3. See Securities Exchange Act Release No. 
35427 (February 28, 1995), 60 FR 12798 (March 8, 1995) (Order 
Approving File No. SR-MSRB-94-10).
    \6\ See Securities Exchange Act Release No. 80295 (March 22, 
2017), 82 FR 15564 (March 29, 2017) (File No. S7-22-16). The 
compliance date for the T+2 settlement cycle was September 5, 2017. 
In April 2016, the Commission approved the MSRB's rule change 
requiring transactions in municipal securities to settle by T+2. See 
Securities Exchange Act Release No. 77744 (April 29, 2016), 81 FR 
26851 (May 4, 2016) (Order Approving File No. SR-MSRB-2016-04).
    \7\ See Securities Exchange Act Release No. 35507 (March 17, 
1995), 60 FR 15616 (March 24, 1995) (Order Approving File No. SR-
NASD-94-56); Securities Exchange Act Release No. 80004 (February 9, 
2017), 82 FR 10835 (February 15, 2017) (Order Approving File No. SR-
FINRA-2016-047) and Securities Exchange Act Release No. 80004A 
(March 6, 2017), 82 FR 13517 (March 13, 2017) (Correction to Order 
Approving File No. SR-FINRA-2016-047). Other self-regulatory 
organizations (``SROs''), including, as previously noted, the MSRB, 
also amended their rules to conform to the shortening of the 
settlement cycle to T+3 and then T+2.

---------------------------------------------------------------------------

[[Page 85679]]

    Even before the adoption of the T+2 settlement cycle, the concept 
of a T+1 settlement cycle already was being considered.\8\ In this 
regard, the Depository Trust & Clearing Corporation (``DTCC'') 
published a white paper in February 2021 highlighting the benefits of 
moving to a T+1 settlement cycle, particularly in light of the 
unprecedented market activity and volatility that had occurred in 2020 
and early 2021.\9\ Following the publication of the DTCC White Paper, 
the industry formed an Industry Steering Committee (``ISC'') \10\ and 
an Industry Working Group (``IWG'') \11\ to develop an industry 
consensus for the transition to a T+1 settlement cycle. In December 
2021, SIFMA, ICI, DTCC, and Deloitte published a report summarizing the 
work conducted by the ISC and IWG and setting forth the ISC's 
recommendations for transitioning to a T+1 settlement cycle.\12\ 
Thereafter, in August 2022, SIFMA, ICI, and Deloitte published a T+1 
implementation playbook to help market participants prepare for the 
implementation of T+1 settlement.\13\

---------------------------------------------------------------------------

    On February 9, 2022, the Commission published a proposal to shorten 
the standard settlement cycle for most U.S. securities transactions 
from T+2 to T+1.\14\ In the SEC T+1 Proposing Release, the Commission 
noted its belief that shortening the settlement cycle from T+2 to T+1 
can promote investor protection, reduce risk, and increase operational 
and capital efficiency. Moreover, the Commission noted that two 
episodes involving increased market volatility-the outbreak of the 
COVID-19 pandemic in March 2020 and the ``meme'' stock phenomenon in 
January 2021-refocused attention on a T+1 standard settlement cycle. In 
the SEC T+1 Proposing Release, the Commission further noted that 
substantial progress has been made toward identifying the technological 
and operational changes that are necessary to establish a T+1 
settlement cycle, including the industry-level changes that would be 
necessary to transition from a T+2 standard to a T+1 standard 
settlement cycle. In proposing new Exchange Act Rule 15c6-2, the 
Commission stated that additional regulatory steps were ``necessary to 
improve the processing of institutional transactions, advancing two 
other longstanding objectives shared by the Commission and the 
securities industry: the completion of trade allocations, 
confirmations, and affirmations on trade date (an objective often 
referred to as ``same-day affirmation'') and the straight-through 
processing of securities transactions.'' \15\ The Commission received 
numerous comment letters on the proposal, specifically regarding the 
proposed amendments to Exchange Act Rule 15c6-1 and proposed new 
Exchange Act Rule 15c6-2.\16\
---------------------------------------------------------------------------

    \14\ See Securities Exchange Act Release No. 94196 (February 9, 
2022), 87 FR 10436 (February 24, 2022) (File No. S7-05-22) (``SEC 
T+1 Proposing Release'').
    \15\ See SEC T+1 Adopting Release, supra note 4, 88 FR 13872, 
13873.
    \16\ Copies of all comment letters received by the Commission 
are available at <a href="https://www.sec.gov/comments/s7-05-22/s70522.htm">https://www.sec.gov/comments/s7-05-22/s70522.htm</a>.
---------------------------------------------------------------------------

    Following consideration of the comments, on February 15, 2023, the 
Commission adopted final rules to shorten the standard settlement cycle 
for most U.S. securities transactions from T+2 to T+1.\17\ In addition 
to the amendments to Exchange Act Rule 15c6-1 to shorten the settlement 
cycle, the Commission adopted new Exchange Act Rule 15c6-2 regarding 
same-day allocations and affirmations.
---------------------------------------------------------------------------

    \17\ See supra note 4.
---------------------------------------------------------------------------

    Final Exchange Act Rule 15c6-1 requires most broker-dealer 
transactions to settle by T+1, subject to certain exceptions. Final 
Exchange Act Rule 15c6-2 addresses same day allocations, confirmations 
and affirmations to improve institutional trades and straight-through 
processing. Certain transactions, primarily involving institutional 
trades, require post-trade exchange of confirmations and affirmations, 
in order for the parties to compare trade details and facilitate 
settlement with third-party custodians. In addition, investment 
managers that effect block trades for the accounts of several customers 
simultaneously need to provide post-trade underlying account allocation 
instructions to the broker or custodian before these transactions can 
settle. Final Exchange Act Rule 15c6-2 requires a broker-dealer to 
either enter into a written agreement or establish, maintain, and 
enforce written policies and procedures reasonably designed to ensure 
the completion of allocations, confirmations, and affirmations (or any 
combination thereof) as soon as technologically practicable and no 
later than the end of trade date in order to complete settlement by 
T+1.
Proposed Rule Change
    Given the Commission's recent changes to shorten the standard 
settlement cycle for most U.S. securities transactions from T+2 to T+1, 
FINRA is proposing amendments to its rules to align them with the 
changes set forth in the T+1 Adopting Release. As such, FINRA is 
proposing to amend FINRA Rules 2341 (Investment Company Securities), 
4515 (Approval and Documentation of Changes in Account Name or 
Designation), 6282 (Transactions Reported by Members to the ADF), 6380A 
(Transaction Reporting), 6380B (Transaction Reporting), 6622 
(Transaction Reporting), 7140 (Trade Report Processing), 7240A (Trade 
Report Processing), 7340 (Trade Report Processing), 11140 (Transactions 
in Securities ``Ex-Dividend,'' ``Ex-Rights'' or ``Ex-Warrants''), 11150 
(Transactions ``Ex-Interest'' in Bonds Which Are Dealt in ``Flat''), 
11210 (Sent by Each Party), 11320 (Dates of Delivery), 11620 
(Computation of Interest), 11860 (COD Orders), 11893 (Clearly Erroneous 
Transactions in OTC Equity Securities), and 11894 (Review by the 
Uniform Practice Code (``UPC'') Committee).
    The details of the proposed rule change are described below.
FINRA Rule 2341 (Investment Company Securities)
    Rule 2341(m)(1) requires members, including underwriters, that 
engage in direct retail transactions for investment

[[Page 85680]]

company shares to transmit payments received from customers for the 
purchase of investment company shares to the payee by the end of the 
second business day after receipt of a customer's order to purchase 
such shares, or by the end of one business day after receipt of a 
customer's payment for such shares, whichever is later. FINRA is 
proposing to amend Rule 2341(m)(1) to change the two-business day 
transmittal requirement to one business day. FINRA is not proposing any 
changes to the one-business day alternative.
4515 (Approval and Documentation of Changes in Account Name or 
Designation)
    Rule 4515 requires that, before a customer order is executed, the 
account name or designation must be placed upon the order form or other 
similar record for the transaction, and addresses the approval and 
documentation procedures for changes in such account name or 
designation. Additionally, Rule 4515.01 provides that when accepting 
orders from investment advisers, the member firm may allow such 
investment advisers to make allocations on their orders for customers 
on whose behalf the investment advisers submit the orders, as long as 
the firm receives specific account designations or customer names from 
such investment advisers by noon of the next business day following the 
trading session.\18\ FINRA is proposing to amend Rule 4515.01 to 
provide that when accepting orders from investment advisers, a member 
firm may allow such investment advisers to make allocations on their 
orders for customers on whose behalf the investment advisers submit the 
orders, as long as the member firm receives specific account 
designations or customer names from such investment advisers by no 
later than the end of the day on the trade date. FINRA is proposing to 
amend the timeframe by which a member firm must receive the specific 
account designations or customer names from the investment adviser to 
conform Rule 4515.01 with the same-day confirmation, allocation, and 
affirmation requirements of new Exchange Act Rule 15c6-2.
---------------------------------------------------------------------------

    \18\ Rule 4515.01 applies only where there is more than one 
customer for any particular order and it extends to investment 
advisers that are registered under the Investment Advisers Act or 
that, but for Investment Advisers Act Section 203(b) or 203A, would 
be required to register under the Investment Advisers Act. In 
addition, Rule 4515.01 clarifies that member firms may not knowingly 
facilitate the allocation of orders from investment advisers in a 
manner other than in compliance with both (i) the investment 
adviser's intent at the time of trade execution to allocate shares 
on a percentage basis to the participating accounts and (ii) the 
investment adviser's fiduciary duty with respect to allocations for 
such participating accounts, including but not limited to 
allocations based on the performance of a transaction between the 
time of execution and the time of allocation.
---------------------------------------------------------------------------

FINRA Rules 6282 (Transactions Reported by Members to the ADF), 6380A 
(Transaction Reporting), 6380B (Transaction Reporting), 6622 
(Transaction Reporting)
    Rules 6282(a)(4)(D), 6380A(a)(5)(D), 6380B(a)(5)(D), and 
6622(a)(5)(D) address transaction reporting with respect to the 
Alternative Display Facility (``ADF''), the FINRA/Nasdaq Trade 
Reporting Facility (``NQTRF''), the FINRA/NYSE Trade Reporting 
Facility, and the Over-the-Counter Reporting Facility (``ORF''), 
respectively. Specifically, these rules require a reporting firm to 
identify a Next Day Trade by appending the appropriate modifier to a 
last sale report. FINRA is proposing to delete Rules 6282(a)(4)(D), 
6380A(a)(5)(D), 6380B(a)(5)(D), and 6622(a)(5)(D) because, upon 
implementation of a T+1 trade settlement cycle, a Next Day Trade will 
become a Regular Way Trade, which is the default settlement type for 
transaction reporting and does not require a modifier.
FINRA Rules 7140 (Trade Report Processing), 7240A (Trade Report 
Processing), and 7340 (Trade Report Processing)
    Rules 7140(a)(3), 7240A(a)(3), and 7340(a)(3) address the automatic 
lock-in of trades in the ADF, the NQTRF, and the ORF, respectively. 
These rules provide that any trade that remains open at the end of its 
entry day will be carried over and automatically locked-in by the 
corresponding system. The trade is then submitted to the National 
Securities Clearing Corporation (``NSCC'') at 2:30 p.m. Eastern Time 
(``ET'') on the next business day. FINRA is proposing to amend Rules 
7140(a)(3), 7240A(a)(3), and 7340(a)(3) to change the time a trade is 
submitted to the NSCC from 2:30 p.m. ET to noon ET to allow for 
sufficient time for NSCC to process the trade.
FINRA Rule 11140 (Transactions in Securities ``Ex-Dividend,'' ``Ex-
Rights'' or ``Ex-Warrants'')
    Rule 11140(b)(1) provides that for dividends or distributions, and 
the issuance or distribution of warrants, that are less than 25 percent 
of the value of the subject security, if definitive information is 
received sufficiently in advance of the record date, the date 
designated as the ``ex-dividend date'' shall be the first business day 
preceding the record date if the record date falls on a business day, 
or the second business day preceding the record date if the record date 
falls on a day designated by FINRA's Uniform Practice Code Committee 
(``Committee'') as a non-delivery date. FINRA is proposing to shorten 
the timeframes in Rule 11140(b)(1) by one business day. As such, the 
date designated as the ``ex-dividend date'' would be the record date if 
the record date falls on a business day, or the first business day 
preceding the record date if the record date falls on a day designated 
by the Committee as a non-delivery date. In addition, the proposed rule 
change would make a non-substantive technical change to the rule.
FINRA Rule 11150 (Transactions ``Ex-Interest'' in Bonds Which Are Dealt 
in ``Flat'')
    Rule 11150(a) prescribes the manner for establishing ``ex-interest 
dates'' for transactions in bonds or other similar evidences of 
indebtedness which are traded ``flat.'' Such transactions are ``ex-
interest'' on (1) the first business day preceding the record date if 
the record date falls on a business day, (2) the second business day 
preceding the record date if the record date falls on a day other than 
a business day, or (3) the second business day preceding the date on 
which an interest payment is to be made if no record date has been 
fixed. FINRA is proposing to shorten the timeframes in Rule 11150(a) by 
one business day. Therefore, the transactions would be ``ex-interest'' 
on (1) the record date if the record date falls on a business day, (2) 
the first business day preceding the record date if the record date 
falls on a day other than a business day, or (3) the first business day 
preceding the date on which an interest payment is to be made if no 
record date has been fixed.
FINRA Rule 11210 (Sent by Each Party)
    Rule 11210(a) requires each party to a transaction, other than a 
cash transaction, to send a Uniform Comparison or Confirmation of the 
transaction on or before the first business day following the date of 
the transaction. FINRA is proposing to shorten the timeframe in Rule 
11210(a) and require the sending of the Uniform Comparison or 
Confirmation of a transaction by the end of the day on the trade date. 
In addition, the proposed rule change would clarify that, as a result 
of this change, the timeframe for the exchange of comparisons or 
confirmations for all transactions (cash and non-cash) would be the 
same.

[[Page 85681]]

    Paragraphs (c) and (d) of Rule 11210 set forth the ``Don't Know'' 
(``DK'') voluntary procedures for using ``DK Notices'' (FINRA Form No. 
101) or other forms of notices, respectively. Depending upon the notice 
used, a confirming member may follow the ``DK'' procedures when it 
sends a comparison or confirmation of a trade (other than one that 
clears through the National Securities Clearing Corporation or other 
registered clearing agency), but does not receive a comparison or 
confirmation or a signed ``DK'' from the contra-member by the close of 
one business day following the trade date of the transaction. The 
procedures generally provide that after this time period, the 
confirming member shall send a ``DK Notice'' (or similar notice) to the 
contra-member. The contra-member then has two business days after 
receipt of the confirming member's notice to either confirm or ``DK'' 
the transaction.
    FINRA is proposing to amend paragraphs (c) and (d) of Rule 11210 to 
provide that the ``DK'' procedures may be used by the confirming member 
if it does not receive a comparison or confirmation or signed ``DK'' 
from the contra-member by the end of the day on the trade date of the 
transaction, rather than by the current close of one business day 
following the trade date of the transaction. In addition, FINRA is 
proposing amendments to paragraphs (c)(2)(A), (c)(3), and (d)(5) of 
Rule 11210 to adjust the time in which a contra-member has to respond 
to a ``DK Notice'' (or similar notice) from two business days after the 
contra-member's receipt of the notice to one business day after the 
contra-member's receipt of the notice.
FINRA Rule 11320 (Dates of Delivery)
    Rule 11320 prescribes delivery dates for various transactions. 
Paragraph (b) states that for a ``regular way'' transaction, delivery 
must be made on, but not before, the second business day after the date 
of the transaction. FINRA is proposing to amend Rule 11320(b) to change 
the reference to the second business day following the date of the 
transaction to the first business day following the date of the 
transaction.
    Rule 11320(c) provides that in a ``seller's option'' transaction, 
delivery may be made by the seller on any business day after the second 
business day following the date of the transaction and prior to the 
expiration of the option. FINRA is proposing to amend Rule 11320(c) to 
change the reference to the second business day following the date of 
the transaction to the first business day following the date of the 
transaction.
FINRA Rule 11620 (Computation of Interest)
    In the settlement of contracts in interest-paying securities other 
than for cash, Rule 11620(a) requires the calculation of interest at 
the rate specified in the security up to, but not including, the second 
business day after the date of the transaction. FINRA is proposing to 
amend Rule 11620(a) to shorten the timeframe to the first business day 
following the date of the transaction.
FINRA Rule 11860 (COD Orders)
    Rule 11860(a) directs members to follow various procedures before 
accepting collect on delivery (``COD'') or payment on delivery 
(``POD'') orders.\19\ Rule 11860(a)(3) provides that the member must 
deliver to the customer a confirmation, or all relevant data 
customarily contained in a confirmation with respect to the execution 
of the order, not later than the close of business on the next business 
day after any such execution. FINRA is proposing to amend Rule 
11860(a)(3) to shorten the timeframe for delivery in the rule to no 
later than the end of the day on the trade date. In addition, the 
proposed rule change would make a non-substantive technical change to 
the rule.
---------------------------------------------------------------------------

    \19\ A COD order is a purchase by the customer where the agent 
is to receive the securities against payment for the purchase and a 
POD order is a sale by the customer where the agent is to deliver 
the securities against payment of the sale proceeds. Alternative 
industry terms for COD and POD orders are delivery vs. payment 
(``DVP'') and receipt vs. payment (``RVP'').
---------------------------------------------------------------------------

    Rule 11860(a)(4) requires that the member have obtained an 
agreement from the customer that the customer will furnish its agent 
instructions with respect to the receipt or delivery of the securities 
involved in the transaction promptly upon receipt by the customer of 
each confirmation, or the relevant data as to each execution, relating 
to such order, and that in any event the customer will assure that such 
instructions are delivered to its agent no later than the close of 
business on the first business day after the date of execution of a COD 
or POD order.
    In light of the Commission's recent adoption of final Exchange Act 
Rule 15c6-2, FINRA is proposing to amend Rule 11860(a)(4) to provide 
that prior to accepting a COD or POD order, the member shall have 
entered into the written agreement, or established the written policies 
and procedures, required by SEA Rule 15c6-2 with respect to any 
resulting transaction.
FINRA Rule 11893. Clearly Erroneous Transactions in OTC Equity 
Securities
    Rule 11893 governs clearly erroneous determinations involving 
transactions in OTC Equity Securities. Pursuant to Rule 11893(a), a 
FINRA officer may declare any transaction involving an OTC Equity 
Security arising out of or reported through a trade reporting system 
owned or operated by FINRA or FINRA Regulation and authorized by the 
Commission null and void if the officer determines that (1) the 
transaction is clearly erroneous, or (2) such actions are necessary for 
the maintenance of a fair and orderly market or the protection of 
investors and the public interest; provided, however, that the officer 
shall take action pursuant to this paragraph as soon as possible after 
becoming aware of the transaction, but in all cases by 3:00 p.m., 
Eastern Time, on the next trading day following the date of the 
transaction(s) at issue. FINRA is proposing to amend Rule 11893(a) to 
require a FINRA officer to take action as soon as possible after 
becoming aware of the transaction, but in all cases no later than the 
start of trading on the day following the date of the transaction(s) at 
issue. FINRA is proposing this change to the rule so that, in the new 
T+1 environment, a determination regarding whether a transaction is 
null and void is made before the trade settles. The proposed change 
also closely aligns the timeframe for a FINRA officer to take action 
with respect to the review of a clearly erroneous transaction in OTC 
Equity Securities with the timeframe for such action in exchange-listed 
securities provided in FINRA Rule 11892 (Clearly Erroneous Transactions 
in Exchange-Listed Securities).
FINRA Rule 11894. Review by the Uniform Practice Code (``UPC'') 
Committee
    Rule 11894 governs the appeal to the UPC Committee of a FINRA 
officer's determination to declare an execution null and void. Under 
the rule, an appeal must be made in writing and must be received by 
FINRA within 30 minutes after the person making the appeal is given the 
notification of the determination being appealed. If the appeal 
pertains to OTC Equity Securities, Rule 11894(b)(2) requires the UPC 
committee to render a determination as soon as practicable, but in no 
case later than two trading days following the date of the execution(s) 
under review. In connection with the shortening of the settlement cycle 
to T+1, FINRA is proposing to amend Rule 11894(b)(2) to

[[Page 85682]]

require the UPC Committee to render a determination as soon as 
practicable, but in no case later than the trading day following the 
date of the execution(s) under review. This proposed rule change also 
more closely aligns the timeframe for UPC Committee determinations with 
respect to OTC Equity Securities with those for exchange-listed 
securities set forth in Rule 11894(b)(1).
Effective Date of Proposed Rule Change
    FINRA has filed the proposed rule change for immediate 
effectiveness. The operative date of the proposed rule change will be 
May 28, 2024, or such later date as may be announced by the Commission 
for compliance for Exchange Act Rules 15c6-1 and 15c6-2.
2. Statutory Basis
    FINRA believes that the proposed rule change is consistent with the 
provisions of Section 15A(b)(6) of the Act,\20\ which requires, among 
other things, that FINRA rules must be designed to prevent fraudulent 
and manipulative acts and practices, to promote just and equitable 
principles of trade, to foster cooperation and coordination with 
persons engaged in regulating, clearing, settling, processing 
information with respect to, and facilitating transactions in 
securities, and, in general, to protect investors and the public 
interest. FINRA believes that the proposed rule change will minimize 
potential confusion and help industry participants comply with the T+1 
settlement cycle by harmonizing FINRA rules with final Exchange Act 
Rules 15c6-1 and 15c6-2. FINRA further believes that by defining 
``regular way'' settlement as occurring on T+1, the proposed rule 
change will result in a reduction of the overall level of systemic risk 
in the financial system and an increase in operational and capital 
efficiency of the clearance and settlement process. In addition, FINRA 
believes that the shortening of the settlement cycle will benefit 
investors by more quickly providing them access to the proceeds of 
their securities transactions.

B. Self-Regulatory Organization's Statement on Burden on Competition

    FINRA does not believe that the proposed rule change will result in 
any burden on competition that is not necessary or appropriate in 
furtherance of the purposes of the Act.
Economic Impact Assessment
    FINRA has undertaken an economic impact assessment, as set forth 
below, to analyze the potential economic impacts of the proposed rule 
change, including anticipated costs, benefits, and distributional and 
competitive effects, relative to current baseline, and the alternatives 
FINRA considered in assessing how best to meet FINRA's regulatory 
objectives.
1. Regulatory Need
    The proposed rule change will harmonize FINRA rules with final 
Exchange Act Rules 15c6-1 and 15c6-2, minimizing potential confusion 
and helping industry participants comply with the T+1 settlement cycle.
2. Economic Baseline
    The economic baseline for the proposed rule change consists of 
current FINRA Rules 2341, 4515, 6282, 6380A, 6380B, 6622, 7140, 7240A, 
7340, 11140, 11150, 11210, 11320, 11620, 11860, 11893, and 11894 as 
well as the amendments adopted by the SEC in final Rules 15c6-1 and 
15c6-2.
3. Economic Impacts
    The proposed changes to FINRA rules conform trade processing and 
asset servicing activities to the shortened settlement cycle and do not 
impose any burdens on industry beyond those that industry must incur to 
implement the SEC's final rules pertaining to a T+1 settlement 
cycle.\21\
---------------------------------------------------------------------------

    \21\ The proposed rule changes are also largely consistent with 
recommendations by industry trade groups. See supra note 13.
---------------------------------------------------------------------------

4. Alternatives Considered
    An alternative to the proposed changes to FINRA Rule 11860 to 
shorten the relevant timeframes to facilitate the transition to T+1 
consistent with final Exchange Act Rule 15c6-2 (no later than the end 
of the day on trade date) is to specify the exact hours on the trade 
date by which a member must deliver a confirmation and a customer must 
deliver instructions on the receipt or delivery of the securities. 
While this alternative would create more uniform practices, we [sic] 
believe that the proposed changes to FINRA Rule 11860 would provide 
greater flexibility and allow members and customers to establish the 
timelines that are more suitable for their operational capacities and 
constraints.

Rule Change Received From Members, Participants, or Others

    Written comments were neither solicited nor received.

III. Date of Effectiveness of the Proposed Rule Change and Timing for 
Commission Action

    Because the foregoing proposed rule change does not: (i) 
significantly affect the protection of investors or the public 
interest; (ii) impose any significant burden on competition; and (iii) 
become operative for 30 days from the date on which it was filed, or 
such shorter time as the Commission may designate, it has become 
effective pursuant to Section 19(b)(3)(A) of the Act \22\ and Rule 19b-
4(f)(6) thereunder.\23\
---------------------------------------------------------------------------

    \22\ 15 U.S.C. 78s(b)(3)(A).
    \23\ 17 CFR 240.19b-4(f)(6). In addition, Rule 19b-4(f)(6)(iii) 
requires the self-regulatory organization to give the Commission 
written notice of the self-regulatory organization's intent to file 
the proposed rule change, along with a brief description and text of 
the proposed rule change, at least five business days prior to the 
date of filing of the proposed rule change, or such shorter time as 
designated by the Commission. FINRA has satisfied this requirement.
---------------------------------------------------------------------------

    At any time within 60 days of the filing of the proposed rule 
change, the Commission summarily may temporarily suspend such rule 
change if it appears to the Commission that such action is necessary or 
appropriate in the public interest, for the protection of investors, or 
otherwise in furtherance of the purposes of the Act. If the Commission 
takes such action, the Commission shall institute proceedings to 
determine whether the proposed rule should be approved or disapproved.
