July 19, 2024.
    On January 16, 2024, NYSE Arca, Inc. (``NYSE Arca'') filed with the 
Securities and Exchange Commission (``Commission''), pursuant to

Commodity-Based Trust Shares.\3\ The proposed rule change was published 
for comment in the Federal Register on January 25, 2024.\4\ The 
Commission received comment letters regarding the proposed rule 
change.\5\ On March 6, 2024, pursuant to Section 19(b)(2) of the 
Act,\6\ the Commission designated a longer period within which to 
approve the proposed rule change, disapprove the proposed rule change, 
or institute proceedings to determine whether to approve or disapprove 
the proposed rule change.\7\ On April 24, 2024, the Commission 
instituted proceedings pursuant to Section 19(b)(2)(B) of the Act \8\ 
to determine whether to approve or disapprove the proposed rule 
change.\9\

    \7\ See Securities Exchange Act Release No. 99683, 89 FR 17888 
(Mar. 12, 2024). The Commission designated April 24, 2024, as the 
date by which the Commission shall approve or disapprove, or 
institute proceedings to determine whether to approve or disapprove, 
the proposed rule change.
    \8\ 15 U.S.C. 78s(b)(2)(B).

(Apr. 30, 2024).
---------------------------------------------------------------------------

    Section 19(b)(2) of the Act \10\ provides that, after initiating 
disapproval proceedings, the Commission shall issue an order approving 
or disapproving the proposed rule change not later than 180 days after 
the date of publication of notice of filing of the proposed rule 
change. The Commission may extend the period for issuing an order 
approving or disapproving the proposed rule change, however, by not 
more than 60 days if the Commission determines that a longer period is 
appropriate and publishes the reasons for such determination. The 
proposed rule change was published for notice and comment in the 
Federal Register on January 25, 2024. July 23, 2024, is 180 days from 
that date. The Commission is extending the time period for approving or 
disapproving the proposed rule change for an additional 60 days. The 
Commission finds it appropriate to designate a longer period within 
which to issue an order approving or disapproving the proposed rule 
change so that it has sufficient time to consider the proposed rule 
change and the issues raised therein. Accordingly, the Commission, 
pursuant to Section 19(b)(2) of the Act,\11\ designates September 21, 
2024, as the date by which the Commission shall either approve or 
disapprove the proposed rule change (File No. SR-NYSEARCA-2024-06).
