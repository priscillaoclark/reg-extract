    General Description of Collection: The Interagency Bank Merger Act 
Application form is used by the FDIC, the Board of Governors of the 
Federal Reserve System, and the Office of the Comptroller of the 
Currency for applications under section 18(c) of the Federal Deposit 
Insurance Act (FDIA), as amended (12 U.S.C. 1828(c)). The application 
is used for a merger, consolidation, or other combining transaction 
between nonaffiliated parties as well as to effect a corporate 
reorganization between affiliated parties (affiliate transaction). An 
affiliate transaction refers to a merger transaction or other business 
combination (including a purchase and assumption) between institutions 
that are commonly controlled (for example, between a depository 
institution and an affiliated interim institution). There are different 
levels of burden for nonaffiliate and affiliate transactions. 
Applicants proposing affiliate transactions are required to provide 
less information than applicants involved in the merger of two 
unaffiliated entities. If depository institutions are not controlled by 
the same holding company, the merger transaction is considered a non-
affiliate transaction. There is no change in the methodology or 
substance of this information collection. The reduction in estimated 
annual burden (from 2,313 hours in 2021 to 1,751 hours currently) is 
due to the decline in the historical number of Reports received by the 
FDIC, which is the basis for the estimated number of annual responses.
    2. Title: Foreign Banks.
    OMB Number: 3064-0114.
    Affected Public: Insured branches of foreign banks.

internal recordkeeping by such branches; and reporting and 
recordkeeping requirements relating to such a branch's pledge of assets 
to the FDIC. There is no change in the methodology or substance of this

    General Description of Collection: The LCR rule implements a 
quantitative liquidity requirement and contains requirements subject to 
the PRA. The requirement is designed to promote the short-term 
resilience of the liquidity risk profile of large and internationally 
active banking organizations, thereby improving the banking sector's 
ability to absorb shocks arising from financial and economic stress, 
and to further improve the measurement and management of liquidity 
risk. The LCR rule establishes a quantitative minimum liquidity 
coverage ratio that requires a company subject to the rule to maintain 
an amount of high-quality liquid assets (the numerator of the ratio) 
that is no less than 100 percent of its total net cash outflows over a 
prospective 30 calendar day period (the denominator of the ratio). 
There is no change in the methodology or substance of this information 
collection. This reduction in estimated annual burden (from 994 hours 
in 2021 to 124 hours currently) is due the reduction in both the 
estimated number of annual respondents and the estimated time per 
response.

Request for Comment

    Comments are invited on: (a) Whether the collections of information 
are necessary for the proper performance of the FDIC's functions, 
including whether the information has practical utility; (b) the 
accuracy of the estimates of the burden of the information collections, 
including the validity of the methodology and assumptions used; (c) 
ways to enhance the quality, utility, and clarity of the information to 
be collected; and (d) ways to minimize the burden of the collections of 
information on respondents, including through the use of automated 
collection techniques or other forms of information technology. All 
comments will become a matter of public record.
