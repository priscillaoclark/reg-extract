SECURITIES AND EXCHANGE COMMISSION

[SEC File No. 270-620, OMB Control No. 3235-0675]


Proposed Collection; Comment Request; Extension: Rule 15Ga-2 and 
Form ABS-15G

Upon Written Request Copies Available From: Securities and Exchange 
Commission, Office of FOIA Services, 100 F Street NE, Washington, DC 
20549-2736

    Notice is hereby given that, pursuant to the Paperwork Reduction 
Act of 1995 (44 U.S.C. 3501 et seq.), the Securities and Exchange 
Commission (``Commission'') is soliciting comments on the collection of 
information summarized below. The Commission plans to submit this 
existing collection of information to the Office of Management and 
Budget for extension and approval.
    Rule 15Ga-2 and Form ABS-15G (17 CFR 249.1400) is used for reports 
of information required under Rule 15Ga-1 and Rule 15Ga-2 (17 CFR 
240.15Ga-1) (17 CFR 240.15Ga-2) of the Exchange Act of 1934 (``Exchange 
Act''). Exchange Act Rule 15Ga-1 requires asset-backed securitizers to 
provide disclosure regarding fulfilled an unfulfilled repurchase 
requests with respect to asset-backed securities. The purpose of the 
information collected on Form ABS-15G is to implement the disclosure 
requirements of Section 943 of the Dodd-Frank Wall Street Reform and 
Consumer Protection Act to provide information regarding the use of 
representations and warranties in the asset-backed securities markets. 
Rule 15Ga-1 had a one-time reporting requirement that expired on 
February 14, 2012. We estimate that approximately 2,007 securitizers 
will file Form ABS-15G annually at estimated (19.307 hours) burden 
hours per response. In addition, we estimate that 75% of the 19.307 
hours per response (14.48 hours) is carried internally by the 
securitizers for a total annual reporting burden of 29,061 hours (14.48 
hours per response x 2,007 responses).
    Written comments are invited on: (a) whether this proposed 
collection of information is necessary for the proper performance of 
the functions of the agency, including whether the information will 
have practical utility; (b) the accuracy of the agency's estimate of 
the burden imposed by the collection of information; (c) ways to 
enhance the quality, utility, and clarity of the information collected; 
and (d) ways to minimize the burden of the collection of information on 
respondents, including through the use of automated collection 
techniques or other forms of information technology. Consideration will 
be given to comments and suggestions submitted in writing within 60 
days of this publication by October 15, 2024.
    An agency may not conduct or sponsor, and a person is not required 
to respond to, a collection of information unless it displays a 
currently valid control number.
    Please direct your written comment to Austin Gerig, Director/Chief 
Data Officer, Securities and Exchange Commission, c/o Oluwaseun Ajayi, 
100 F Street NE, Washington, DC 20549 or send an email to:

Secretary.
