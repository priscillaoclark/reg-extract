    Reference: AP003048AA
    Brief Description of Nature and Purpose of the Facility: EXIM may 
consider one or more general guarantees on the interest of Secured 
Notes issued by the Private Export Funding Corporation (PEFCO), in 
accordance with both the Guarantee and Credit Agreement, as Amended, 
and the Guarantee Agreement between EXIM and PEFCO. The purpose of the 
guarantees of interest on the Secured Notes is to facilitate private 
funding from the U.S. capital markets for EXIM-guaranteed export 
finance transactions.
    Total Amount of Guarantees: The exact number is not determinable 
due to market-determined pricing and uncertainty as to the amount and 
timing of Secured Notes to be issued; however, it could potentially be 
in excess of $100 million for Secured Notes issued during the course of 
Fiscal Year 2024.
    Reasons for the Facility and Methods of Operation: The general 
guarantee serves to guarantee interest on PEFCO's issuance of Secured 
Notes. The principal amount of the Secured Notes is secured by a 
collateral pool of U.S. government-risk debt and securities, including 
EXIM-guaranteed loans. The proceeds from the Secured Notes are used to 
fund additional EXIM-guaranteed loans and provide a liquid secondary 
market for EXIM-guaranteed loans.
    Party Requesting Guarantee: Private Export Funding Corporation 
(PEFCO).
    Information on Decision: Information on the final decision for this 
transaction will be available in the ``Summary Minutes of Meetings of 
Board of Directors'' on <a href="https://www.exim.gov/news/meeting-minutes">https://www.exim.gov/news/meeting-minutes</a>.

Joyce B. Stone,
Assistant Corporate Secretary.
