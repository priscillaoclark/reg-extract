FEDERAL DEPOSIT INSURANCE CORPORATION

12 CFR Part 335

RIN 3064-AD67

 
Securities of Nonmember Insured Banks

AGENCY: Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation.

ACTION: Interim final rule; request for comment.

-----------------------------------------------------------------------

SUMMARY: The FDIC is revising its securities disclosure regulations 
applicable to state nonmember banks with securities required to be 
registered under section 12 of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 
(Exchange Act). The final rule cross references changes in regulations 
adopted by the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) into the 
provisions of the FDIC's securities regulations. Cross referencing will 
assure that the FDIC's regulations remain substantially similar to the 
SEC's regulations, as required by law. The final rule provides general 
references to SEC regulations by title and part of the Code of Federal 
Regulations (CFR), rather than by specific references to sections and 
subparts of the CFR as are currently provided in part 335. This 
revision reflects changes to SEC regulations with respect to small 
business issuers and will provide general guidance to FDIC filers 
regarding the electronic filing of certain documents. The amendments to 
part 335 references to SEC regulations will greatly reduce the need for 
future revisions of part 335, and the FDIC's regulations will be 
consistent with the SEC regulations through the cross reference stated 
in 12 CFR 335.101.

DATES: These amendments are effective on November 30, 2010. Comments 
must be submitted on or before January 31, 2011.

SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION:

I. Background

    Section 12(i) of the Exchange Act, as amended (15 U.S.C. 78l(i)), 
authorizes the FDIC to issue regulations applicable to the securities 
of state nonmember banks that are substantially similar to those of the 
SEC with respect to its powers, functions, and duties to administer and 
enforce sections 10A(m) (standards relating to audit committees), 12 
(securities registration), 13 (periodic reporting), 14(a) (proxies and 
proxy solicitation), 14(c) (information statements), 14(d) (tender 
offers), 14(f) (arrangements for changes in directors), and 16 
(beneficial ownership and reporting) of the Exchange Act, and sections 
302 (corporate responsibility for financial reports), 303 (improper 
influence on conduct of audits), 304 (forfeiture of certain bonuses and 
profits), 306 (insider trades during blackout periods), 401(b) 
(disclosure of pro forma financial information), 404 (management 
assessment of internal controls), 406 (code of ethics for senior 
financial officers), and 407 (disclosure of audit committee financial 
expert) of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act (codified at 15 U.S.C. 7241, 7242, 
7243, 7244, 7261, 7262, 7264, and 7265). These regulations must be 
substantially similar to the regulations of the SEC under the listed 
sections of the Exchange Act and the Sarbanes-Oxley Act, unless the 
FDIC publishes its reasons for deviating from the SEC's rules. The 
proposed amendments to this part provide references to titles and parts 
of the CFR, and eliminate references to specific CFR sections and 
subparts, as a general cross reference is provided in Sec.  335.101. 
The elimination of CFR section and subpart references provides 
efficiency as regulatory revisions by the SEC impacting CFR sections 
and subparts will no longer require amendments to part 335 each time a 
CFR section and subpart is amended.

II. Section by Section Analysis

    Part 335 will be amended throughout to reflect the elimination of 
certain references to sections and subparts of the Code of Federal 
Regulations that the FDIC is currently required to administer and 
enforce under section 12(i) of the Exchange Act, provide a general 
cross reference to the relevant title and part of the Code of Federal 
Regulations, and reflect required and voluntary electronic filing of 
FDIC forms. Accordingly, the following sections in part 335 will be 
amended, where appropriate, to remove references to specific CFR 
sections and subparts in the SEC's regulations that have been cross 
referenced in section 335.101: Sec.  335.111 (Forms and schedules), 
Sec.  335.121 (Listing standards related to audit committees), Sec.  
335.201 (Securities exempted from registration), Sec.  335.211 
(Registration and reporting), section 335.221 (Forms for registration 
of securities and other matters), Sec.  335.231 (Certification, 
suspension of trading, and removal from listing by exchanges), Sec.  
335.241 (Unlisted trading), Sec.  335.251 (Forms for notification of 
action taken by national securities exchanges), Sec.  335.261 
(Exemptions; terminations; and definitions), Sec.  335.301 (Reports of 
issuers of securities registered pursuant to Sec.  12), Sec.  335.311 
(Forms for annual, quarterly, current, and other reports of issuers), 
Sec.  335.321 (Maintenance of records and issuer's representations in 
connection with required reports), Sec.  335.331 (Acquisition 
statements, acquisition of securities by issuers, and other matters), 
Sec.  335.401 (Solicitation of proxies), Sec.  335.501 (Tender offers), 
Sec.  335.601 (Requirements of section 16 of the Securities Exchange

[[Page 73948]]

Act of 1934), Sec.  335.611 (Initial statement of beneficial ownership 
of securities), Sec.  335.612 (Statement of changes in beneficial 
ownership of securities), Sec.  335.613 (Annual statement of beneficial 
ownership of securities), Sec.  335.701 (Filing requirements, public 
reference, and confidentiality), and Sec.  335.801 (Inapplicable SEC 
regulations; FDIC substituted regulations; additional information).
    Section 335.111 (Forms and Schedules) will be amended to provide 
information regarding access to and the use of beneficial ownership 
Forms 3, 4, and 5 from the FDIC Web site.
    Section 335.221 (Forms for registration of securities and other 
matters) will be revised to delete paragraph (c) in order to reflect 
amendments to SEC regulations that eliminate the optional forms for 
small business issuer filing requirements. To accommodate this 
revision, current paragraph (d), which cross references the 
requirements of SEC Regulation FD (Fair Disclosure) (17 CFR 243.100 
through 243.103), will be renamed paragraph (c).
    Section 335.311 (Forms for annual, quarterly, current, and other 
reports of issuers) will be amended to delete references to ``small 
business issuers'' and optional forms for filing requirements in order 
to reflect amendments to SEC regulations that no longer provide 
optional forms for filing by small business issuers.
    Section 335.601 (Requirements of section 16 of the Securities 
Exchange Act of 1934), Sec.  335.701 (Filing requirements, public 
reference, and confidentiality), and Sec.  335.801 (Inapplicable SEC 
regulations; FDIC substituted regulations; additional information) will 
be amended, where applicable, to reflect the electronic filing 
requirements with respect to Beneficial Ownership Report Forms 3, 4, 
and 5 required by the Exchange Act, as amended by the Sarbanes-Oxley 
Act of 2002. The sections also will be amended to reflect the 
availability of voluntary electronic filing on the FDIC Web site. In 
addition, Sec.  335.801 will be amended to reflect the appropriate 
forms for the hardship exemption from mandatory electronic filing.
    Finally, the FDIC will make certain nonsubstantive changes to Part 
335 to improve its clarity and readability and to correct outdated 
terms.

III. Request for Comments

    The FDIC requests comments on all aspects of the rule changes. 
Commenters suggesting that the FDIC modify the requirements of the 
SEC's rules, regulations, and forms for state nonmember banks should 
support their request by demonstrating how such modification would 
satisfy the requirements of section 12(i) of the Exchange Act.
    Comments are also welcome on the general organization of Part 335.

IV. Regulatory Analysis and Procedure

A. Administrative Procedure Act

    The process of amending Part 335 by means of this Interim Rule is 
governed by the Administrative Procedure Act (APA). Pursuant to section 
553(b)(B) of the APA, general notice and opportunity for public comment 
are not required with respect to a rulemaking when (1) the rule is 
interpretative or relates to an agency's rules of organization, 
procedure, or practice, and (2) an agency for good cause finds that 
``notice and public procedure thereon are impracticable, unnecessary, 
or contrary to the public interest.'' Similarly, sections 553(d)(2), 
(3) of the APA provide that the publication of a rule shall be made not 
less than 30 days before its effective date, except if the rule is 
interpretative and ``as otherwise provided by the agency for good cause 
found and published with the rule.''
    Consistent with sections 553(b)(A), (B) of the APA, the FDIC finds 
that good cause exists for a finding that general notice and 
opportunity for public comment are unnecessary in that certain portions 
of part 335 that are being amended in light of the issuance of 
regulations by the SEC, which SEC issuances already have been subjected 
to public notice and request for comment. In addition, certain other 
changes to part 335 are organizational in nature and are exempt from 
the APA's general notice and public comment requirement. Accordingly, 
pursuant to the APA, the FDIC is foregoing the general notice and 
public comment requirement as to this rulemaking.
    Further, immediate issuance of this Interim Rule furthers the 
public interest by conforming the FDIC's rules with the SEC's 
requirements and organizing the rule to reduce redundancies and 
increase readability. For these same reasons, the FDIC finds good cause 
to publish this Interim Rule with an immediate effective date.\1\
---------------------------------------------------------------------------

    \1\ 5 U.S.C. 553(d)(3).
---------------------------------------------------------------------------

    Although general notice and opportunity for public comment are not 
required prior to the effective date, the FDIC invites comments on all 
aspects of the Interim Rule, which the FDIC may revise if necessary or 
appropriate in light of the comments received.

B. Riegle Community Development and Regulatory Improvement Act

    The Riegle Community Development and Regulatory Improvement Act 
provides that any new regulations or amendments to regulations 
prescribed by a Federal banking agency that impose additional 
reporting, disclosures, or other new requirements on insured depository 
institutions shall take effect on the first day of a calendar quarter 
which begins on or after the date on which the regulations are 
published in final form, unless the agency determines, for good cause 
published with the rule, that the rule should become effective before 
such time.\2\ For the same reasons discussed above, the FDIC finds that 
good cause exists for an immediate effective date for the Interim Rule.
---------------------------------------------------------------------------

    \2\ 12 U.S.C. 4802.
---------------------------------------------------------------------------

C. Paperwork Reduction Act

    This rule contains no new collections of information as defined by 
the Paperwork Reduction Act.

D. Regulatory Flexibility Act

    A regulatory flexibility analysis is required only when the agency 
must publish a notice of proposed rulemaking (5 U.S.C. 603, 604). 
Because the revisions to part 335 are published in interim final form 
without a notice of proposed rulemaking, no regulatory flexibility 
analysis is required.

E. Small Business Regulatory Enforcement Fairness Act

    The Office of Management and Budget (OMB) has determinedthat the 
Interim Rule is not a ``major rule'' within the meaning of the relevant 
sections of the Small Business Regulatory Enforcement Act of 1996 
(SBREFA), 5 U.S.C. 801 et seq. As required by SBREFA, the FDIC will 
file the appropriate reports with Congress and the Government 
Accountability Office as soon as it receives a determination from OMB. 
Nevertheless, as discussed above, consistent with section 553(b)(B) of 
the APA, the FDIC has determined for good cause that general notice and 
opportunity for public comment is unnecessary. Therefore, in accordance 
with 5 U.S.C. 808(2), this Interim Rule will take effect upon 
publication in the Federal Register.

    (1) The person shall omit from the statement, report, or document, 
when it is filed, the portion thereof that it desires to keep 
undisclosed (hereinafter called the confidential portion). In lieu 
thereof, it shall indicate at the appropriate place in the statement, 
report, or document that the confidential portion has been so omitted 
and filed separately with the FDIC.
    (2) The person shall file with the copies of the statement, report,

``Confidential Treatment,'' as there are copies of the statement, 
report, or document filed with the FDIC and with each exchange, if any. 
Each copy shall contain the complete text of the item and, 
notwithstanding that the confidential portion does not constitute the 
whole of the answer, the entire answer thereto; except that in the case 
where the confidential portion is part of a financial statement or 
schedule, only the particular financial statement or schedule need be 
included. All copies of the confidential portion shall be in the same 
form as the remainder of the statement, report, or document;

document that has been omitted;
    (B) A statement of the grounds of the objection;
    (C) Consent that the FDIC may determine the question of public 
disclosure upon the basis of the application, subject to proper 
judicial reviews;

report, or document is filed;

    (4) If the FDIC determines that the objection shall be sustained, a 
notation to that effect will be made at the appropriate place in the 
statement, report, or document.
    (5) If the FDIC determines that disclosure of the confidential 
portion is in the public interest, a finding and determination to that 
effect will be entered and notice of the finding and determination will 
be sent by registered or certified mail to the person.
    (6) The confidential portion shall be made available to the public:
    (i) Upon the lapse of 15 days after the dispatch of notice by 
registered or certified mail of the finding and determination of the 
FDIC described in paragraph (c)(5) of this section, or the date of the 
electronic filing, if prior to the lapse of such 15 days the person 
shall not have filed a written statement that he intends in good faith 
to seek judicial review of the finding and determination;
    (ii) Upon the lapse of 60 days after the dispatch of notice by 
registered or certified mail, or the date of the electronic filing, of

22. Amend Section 335.801 by revising paragraphs (b)(1), (b)(2), 
(b)(6)(iv), and (b)(6)(v) to read as follows:


Sec.  335.801  Inapplicable SEC regulations; FDIC substituted 
regulations; additional information.

* * * * *
    (b) Electronic filings. (1) The FDIC does not participate in the 
SEC's EDGAR (Electronic Data Gathering Analysis and Retrieval) 
electronic filing program (17 CFR part 232). The FDIC permits voluntary 
electronically transmitted filings and submissions of correspondence 
and other materials in electronic format to the FDIC, with the 
exception of Beneficial Ownership Reports (Forms 3, 4, and 5) for which 
electronic filing is mandatory. Beneficial Ownership Report filing 
requirements are provided in paragraph (b)(2) of this section.
    (2) All reporting persons must electronically file Beneficial 
Ownership Reports (FDIC Forms 3, 4, and 5), including amendments and 
exhibits thereto, using the Internet-based interagency Beneficial 
Ownership Filings System, except that a reporting person that has 
obtained a continuing hardship exemption under these rules may file the 
forms with the FDIC in paper format. For electronic filing purposes, 
FDIC Forms 3, 4, and 5 are accessible at the Internet-based interagency 
Web site for Beneficial Ownership Filings at FDICconnect at <A HREF="http://frwebgate.access.gpo.gov/cgi-bin/leaving.cgi?from=leavingFR.html&log=linklog&to=https://www2.fdicconnect.gov/index.asp">https://
www2.fdicconnect.gov/index.asp</A>. These forms and the instructions 
thereto are available for printing and downloading at <A HREF="http://frwebgate.access.gpo.gov/cgi-bin/leaving.cgi?from=leavingFR.html&log=linklog&to=http://www.fdic.gov/regulations/laws/forms">http://
www.fdic.gov/regulations/laws/forms</A>. A reporting person that has 
obtained a continuing hardship exemption under these rules may file the 
appropriate forms with the FDIC in paper format. Instructions for 
continuing hardship exemptions are provided in paragraph (b)(6) of this 
section.
* * * * *
    (6) * * *
    (iv) Where a continuing hardship exemption is granted with respect 
to an exhibit only, the paper format exhibit shall be filed with the 
FDIC under Form SE (17 CFR part 249). The name of the FDIC shall be 
substituted for the name of the SEC on the form. Form SE shall be filed 
as a paper cover sheet to all exhibits to Beneficial Ownership Reports 
submitted to the FDIC in paper form pursuant to a hardship exemption.
    (v) Form SE may be filed with the FDIC up to six business days 
prior to, or on the date of filing of, the electronic form to which it 
relates but shall not be filed after such filing date. If a paper 
exhibit is submitted in this manner, requirements that the exhibit be 
filed with, provided with, or accompany the electronic filing shall be 
satisfied. Any requirements as to delivery or furnishing the 
information to persons other than the FDIC shall not be affected by 
this section.

    By order of the Board of Directors.

Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation.

    Dated at Washington, DC, this 9th day of November 2010.
