I. Self-Regulatory Organization's Statement of the Terms of Substance 
of the Proposed Rule Change

    The Exchange proposes to amend NYSE Arca Equities Rule 8.500 
(``Trust Units'') to provide that the issuers of Trust Units listed or 
traded pursuant to unlisted trading privileges (``UTP'') may invest 
directly in investments comprising or otherwise based on any 
combination of futures contracts, options on futures contracts, forward 
contracts, swap contracts, commodities and/or securities rather than 
solely in the assets of a trust, partnership, limited liability 
company, corporation or other similar entity constituted as a commodity 
pool that holds such investments. The text of the proposed rule change 
is available at the Exchange, the Commission's Public Reference Room, 
and at the Exchange's Web site at <A HREF="http://frwebgate.access.gpo.gov/cgi-bin/leaving.cgi?from=leavingFR.html&log=linklog&to=http://www.nyse.com">http://www.nyse.com</A>.

II. Self-Regulatory Organization's Statement of the Purpose of, and 
Statutory Basis for, the Proposed Rule Change

    In its filing with the Commission, the self-regulatory organization 
included statements concerning the purpose of, and basis for, the 
proposed rule change and discussed any comments it received on the 
proposed rule change. The text of those statements may be examined at 
the places specified in Item IV below. The Exchange has prepared 
summaries, set forth in sections A, B, and C below, of the most 
significant parts of such statements.

A. Self-Regulatory Organization's Statement of the Purpose of, and the 
Statutory Basis for, the Proposed Rule Change

1. Purpose
    NYSE Arca Equities Rule 8.500 permits listing or trading pursuant 
to UTP of Trust Units, which are defined as securities that are issued 
by a trust or other similar entity that invests in the assets of a 
trust, partnership, limited liability company, corporation or other 
similar entity constituted as a commodity pool that holds investments 
comprising or otherwise based on any combination of futures contracts, 
options on futures contracts, forward contracts, swap contracts, 
commodities and/or securities.\4\ NYSE Arca Equities Rule 8.500 was 
adopted in contemplation of the trading pursuant to UTP of shares of 
the Nuveen Commodities Income and Growth Fund (``Fund''), sponsored by 
Nuveen Investments, Inc. (``Nuveen''). The Exchange proposes to amend 
NYSE Arca Equities Rule 8.500(b)(2) to provide that the issuers of 
Trust Units listed or traded pursuant to UTP may invest directly in 
investments comprising or otherwise based on any combination of futures 
contracts, options on futures contracts, forward contracts, swap 
contracts, commodities and/or securities rather than solely in the 
assets of a trust, partnership, limited liability company, corporation 
or other similar entity constituted as a commodity pool that holds such 
investments.
---------------------------------------------------------------------------

    \4\ See Securities Exchange Act Release No. 57059 (December 28, 
2007), 73 FR 909 (January 4, 2008) (SR-NYSEArca-2006-76) (notice of 
filing and order granting accelerated approval of proposed rule 
change relating to trading shares of the Nuveen Commodities Income 
and Growth Fund pursuant to UTP).
---------------------------------------------------------------------------

    The American Stock Exchange LLC (``Amex'') (now known as NYSE Amex 
LLC (``NYSE Amex'')) initially had proposed to list the Fund and 
adopted Amex Rules 1600 et seq. in contemplation of such listing.\5\ 
The Fund did not commence listing on Amex in the form described in the 
Initial Amex Notice. Nuveen subsequently proposed to go forward with a 
listing of shares (the ``Shares'') of the Fund on NYSE Amex under a new 
name, the Nuveen Diversified Commodity Fund. The Fund proposed to 
utilize a modified investment plan, which was described in detail in 
the NYSE Amex proposed rule change filed in connection with listing the 
Fund.\6\ As described in the NYSE Amex Notice, the Fund determined not 
to utilize the master/feeder structure described in the Initial Amex 
Notice due to a change in the interpretation of applicable tax law by 
the Internal Revenue Service. Instead, the Fund would make its own 
direct investments. Consequently, NYSE Amex proposed to amend the 
definition of Trust Units in NYSE Amex Rule 1600 to remove the master/
feeder structure requirement and permit the listing of Trust Units 
where the issuer is constituted as a commodity pool which invests 
directly in commodities and commodity derivatives. The Commission 
approved listing of the Fund on NYSE Amex, and trading of the Fund on 
NYSE Amex commenced on September 28. 2010.\7\
---------------------------------------------------------------------------

    \5\ See Securities Exchange Act Release No. 56880 (December 3, 
2007), 72 FR 69259 (December 7, 2007) (SR-Amex-2006-96) (order 
approving proposed rule change relating to listing and trading of 
Trust Units of the Nuveen Commodities Income and Growth Fund). The 
investment plan of the Fund was described in detail in the Amex's 
Form 19b-4 and in the notice published for SR-Amex-2006-96. See 
Securities Exchange Act Release No. 56465 (September 19, 2007), 72 
FR 54489 (September 25, 2007) (``Initial Amex Notice'').
    \6\ See Securities Exchange Act Release No. 61571 (February 23, 
2010) 75 FR 9265 (March 1, 2010) (SR-NYSE-Amex-2010-09) (notice of 
filing of proposed rule change amending NYSE Amex Trust Unit Rules 
and proposing the listing of the Nuveen Diversified Commodity Fund) 
(``NYSE Amex Notice'').
    \7\ The Commission approved the proposed rule change in 
Securities Exchange Act Release No. 61807 (March 31, 2010), 75 FR 
17818 (April 7, 2010) (SR-NYSE-Amex-2010-09) (order approving 
proposed rule change amending NYSE Amex Trust Unit rules and 
proposing the listing of the Nuveen Diversified Commodity Fund) 
(``NYSE Amex Approval Order'').
---------------------------------------------------------------------------

    In order to accommodate trading of Shares of the Fund on the 
Exchange pursuant to UTP, the Exchange proposes to amend NYSE Arca 
Equities Rule 8.500(b)(2) to define the term ``Trust Units'' as a 
security that is issued by a trust or similar entity constituted as a 
commodity pool that holds investments comprising or otherwise based on 
any combination of futures contracts, options on futures contracts, 
forward contracts, swap contracts, commodities and/or securities. The 
proposed rule change is substantially identical to that approved for 
NYSE Amex in the NYSE Amex Approval Order, except that proposed NYSE 
Arca Equities Rule 8.500(b)(2) continues to include the words ``and/or 
securities'', which are not included in NYSE Amex Rule 1600. The 
Exchange represents that all representations regarding the Fund listed 
and traded on NYSE Amex, as described in the NYSE Amex Notice and NYSE 
Amex Approval Order, continue to apply.
2. Statutory Basis
    The proposed rule change is consistent with Section 6(b) \8\ of the 
Act, in general, and furthers the objectives of Section 6(b)(5),\9\ in 
particular, in that it is designed to prevent fraudulent and 
manipulative acts and practices, to promote just and equitable 
principles of trade, to foster cooperation and coordination with 
persons engaged in facilitating transactions in securities, and to 
remove impediments to and perfect the mechanisms of a free and open 
market and a national market system. The Exchange believes that the 
proposed rule change will facilitate the trading pursuant to UTP of an 
additional type of exchange-traded product that will enhance 
competition among market participants, to the benefit of investors and 
the marketplace.

---------------------------------------------------------------------------

B. Self-Regulatory Organization's Statement on Burden on Competition

    The Exchange does not believe that the proposed rule change will 
impose any burden on competition that is not

[[Page 65541]]

necessary or appropriate in furtherance of the purposes of the Act.

C. Self-Regulatory Organization's Statement on Comments on the Proposed 
Rule Change Received From Members, Participants, or Others

    No written comments were solicited or received with respect to the 
proposed rule change.

III. Date of Effectiveness of the Proposed Rule Change and Timing for 
Commission Action

    The Exchange has filed the proposed rule change pursuant to Section 
19(b)(3)(A)(iii) of the Act \10\ and Rule 19b-4(f)(6) thereunder.\11\ 
Because the proposed rule change does not: (i) Significantly affect the 
protection of investors or the public interest; (ii) impose any 
significant burden on competition; and (iii) become operative prior to 
30 days from the date on which it was filed, or such shorter time as 
the Commission may designate, if consistent with the protection of 
investors and the public interest, the proposed rule change has become 
effective pursuant to Section 19(b)(3)(A) of the Act \12\ and Rule 19b-
4(f)(6)(iii) thereunder.\13\
---------------------------------------------------------------------------

    \10\ 15 U.S.C. 78s(b)(3)(A)(iii).
    \11\ 17 CFR 240.19b-4(f)(6).
    \12\ 15 U.S.C. 78s(b)(3)(A).
    \13\ 17 CFR 240.19b-4(f)(6). In addition, Rule 19b-4(f)(6)(iii) 
requires the Exchange to give the Commission written notice of the 
Exchange's intent to file the proposed rule change along with a 
brief description and text of the proposed rule change, at least 
five business days prior to the date of filing of the proposed rule 
change, or such shorter time as designated by the Commission. The 
Exchange has satisfied this requirement.
---------------------------------------------------------------------------

    A proposed rule change filed under Rule 19b-4(f)(6) normally does 
not become operative for 30 days after the date of filing. However, 
Rule 19b-4(f)(6)(iii) permits the Commission to designate a shorter 
time if such action is consistent with the protection of investors and 
the public interest. The Exchange requests that the Commission waive 
the 30-day operative delay so that the Exchange can trade, on a UTP 
basis, shares of the Fund immediately. The Exchange believes that the 
immediate trading of shares of the Fund will promote competition among 
exchange markets trading such shares. The Commission believes that 
waiving the 30-day operative delay to permit the Exchange to trade, on 
a UTP basis, shares of the Fund without delay is consistent with the 
protection of investors and the public interest.\14\ The Commission 
notes that the proposed amendments to NYSE Arca Equities Rule 8.500 are 
similar to amendments to NYSE Amex Rule 1600, previously approved by 
the Commission \15\ and therefore do not raise any new regulatory 
issues. For these reasons, the Commission designates the proposed rule 
change as operative upon filing.\16\
---------------------------------------------------------------------------

    \14\ For purposes only of waiving the 30-day operative delay, 
the Commission has also considered the proposed rule's impact on 
efficiency, competition, and capital formation. See 15 U.S.C. 
78c(f).
    \15\ See Securities Exchange Act Release No. 61807 (March 31, 
2010), 75 FR 17818 (April 7, 2010) (SR-NYSE-Amex-2010-09).
    \16\ The Commission notes that this proposed rule change only 
permits trading of products under the proposed modifications to 
Exchange Rule 8.500 on and after the effective date of this filing 
and does not relate to any trading under such proposed rules prior 
to such date.
---------------------------------------------------------------------------

    At any time within 60 days of the filing of the proposed rule 
change, the Commission summarily may temporarily suspend such rule 
change if it appears to the Commission that such action is necessary or 
appropriate in the public interest, for the protection of investors, or 
otherwise in furtherance of the purposes of the Act.
