COMMODITY FUTURES TRADING COMMISSION

17 CFR Part 143

RIN 3038-AF32


Annual Adjustment of Civil Monetary Penalties To Reflect 
Inflation--2024

AGENCY: Commodity Futures Trading Commission.

ACTION: Final rule.

-----------------------------------------------------------------------

SUMMARY: The Commodity Futures Trading Commission (Commission) is 
amending its rule that governs the maximum amount of civil monetary 
penalties imposed under the Commodity Exchange Act (CEA), to adjust for 
inflation. This rule sets forth the maximum, inflation-adjusted dollar 
amount for civil monetary penalties (CMPs) assessable for violations of 
the CEA and Commission rules, regulations and orders thereunder. The 
rule, as amended, implements the Federal Civil Penalties Inflation 
Adjustment Act of 1990, as amended.

DATES: This rule is effective on January 24, 2024 and is applicable to 
penalties assessed after January 15, 2024.

Counsel, Division of Enforcement, at (202) 418-5327 or

Street NW, Washington, DC 20581.

SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION:

I. Background

    The Federal Civil Penalties Inflation Adjustment Act of 1990 
(FCPIAA) \1\ requires the head of each Federal agency to periodically 
adjust for inflation the minimum and maximum amount of CMPs provided by 
law within the jurisdiction of that agency.\2\ A 2015 amendment to the 
FCPIAA \3\ required agencies to make an initial ``catch-up'' adjustment 
to its civil monetary penalties effective no later than August 1, 
2016.\4\ For every year thereafter effective not later than January 
15th, the FCPIAA, as amended, requires agencies to make annual 
adjustments for inflation, with guidance from the Director of the 
Office of Management and Budget.\5\
---------------------------------------------------------------------------

    \1\ The FCPIAA, Public Law 101-410 (1990), as amended, is 
codified at 28 U.S.C. 2461 note. The FCPIAA states that the purpose 
of the FCPIAA is to establish a mechanism that shall (1) allow for 
regular adjustment for inflation of civil monetary penalties; (2) 
maintain the deterrent effect of civil monetary penalties and 
promote compliance with the law; and (3) improve the collection by 
the Federal Government of civil monetary penalties.
    \2\ For the relevant CMPs within the Commission's jurisdiction, 
the Act provides only for maximum amounts that can be assessed for 
each violation of the Act or the rules, regulations and orders 
promulgated thereunder; the Act does not set forth any minimum 
penalties. Therefore, the remainder of this release will refer only 
to CMP maximums.

II. Commodity Exchange Act Civil Monetary Penalties

    The following sections of the CEA provide for CMPs that meet the 
FCPIAA

definition \6\ and these CMPs are, therefore, subject to the inflation 
adjustment: Sections 6(c), 6b, and 6c of the CEA.\7\
---------------------------------------------------------------------------

    \6\ FCPIAA Section 3(2).
    \7\ 7 U.S.C. 9, 13a-1, 13b. Criminal authorities may also seek 
fines for criminal violations of the CEA (see 7 U.S.C. 13, 13(c), 
13(d), 13(e), and 13b). The FCPIA does not affect the amounts of 
these criminal penalties.
---------------------------------------------------------------------------

III. Annual Inflation Adjustment for Commodity Exchange Act Civil 
Monetary Penalties

A. Methodology

    The FCPIAA annual inflation adjustment, in the context of the 
CFTC's CMPs, is determined by increasing the maximum penalty by a 
``cost-of-living adjustment'', rounded to the nearest multiple of one 
dollar.\8\ Annual inflation adjustments are based on the percent change 
between the October Consumer Price Index for all Urban Consumers (CPI-
U) preceding the date of the adjustment, and the prior year's October 
CPI-U.\9\ In this case, the October 2023 CPI-U (307.671)/October 2022 
CPI-U (298.012) = 1.03241.\10\ In order to complete the 2024 annual 
adjustment, the CFTC must multiply each of its most recent CMP amounts 
by the multiplier, 1.03241, and round to the nearest dollar.\11\
---------------------------------------------------------------------------

    \8\ FCPIAA Sections 4 and 5.
    \9\ FCPIAA Section 5(b)(1).
    \10\ The CPI-U is published by the Department of Labor. 
Interested parties may find the relevant Consumer Price Index on the 
internet. To access this information, go to the Consumer Price Index 
Home Page at: <a href="http://www.bls.gov/cpi/">http://www.bls.gov/cpi/</a>. Click the ``CPI Data/

\1\ The term ``Registered Entity'' is defined in 7 U.S.C. 1a (Section 1a of the Commodity Exchange Act).

    The FCPIAA provides that any increase under the FCPIAA in a civil 
monetary penalty shall apply only to civil monetary penalties, 
including those whose associated violation predated such increase, 
which are assessed after the date the increase takes effect.\13\ Thus, 
the new CMP amounts established by this rulemaking shall apply to 
penalties assessed after January 15, 2024, for violations that occurred 
on or after November 2, 2015, the effective date of the FCPIAA 
amendment requiring annual adjustments, the 2015 Act.

IV. Administrative Compliance

A. Notice Requirement

    The FCPIAA specifically exempted from the Administrative Procedure 
Act (APA) the rulemakings required to implement annual inflation 
adjustments.\14\ This means that the public procedure the APA generally 
requires--notice, an opportunity for comment, and a delay in effective 
date--is not required for agencies to issue regulations implementing 
the annual adjustment.\15\ The Commission further notes that the notice 
and comment procedures of the APA do not apply to this rulemaking 
because the Commission is acting herein pursuant to statutory language 
that mandates that the Commission act in a nondiscretionary matter.\16\

---------------------------------------------------------------------------

B. Regulatory Flexibility Act

    The Regulatory Flexibility Act \17\ requires agencies with 
rulemaking authority to consider the impact of certain of their rules 
on small businesses. A regulatory flexibility analysis is only required 
for rules for which the agency publishes a general notice of proposed 
rulemaking pursuant to section 553(b) or any other law.\18\ Because, as 
discussed above, the Commission is not obligated by section 553(b) or 
any other law to publish a general notice of proposed rulemaking with 
respect to the revisions being made to Rule 143.8, the Commission 
additionally is not obligated to conduct a regulatory flexibility 
analysis.

    The Paperwork Reduction Act of 1995 (PRA),\19\ which imposes 
certain requirements on Federal agencies, including the Commission, in 
connection with their conducting or sponsoring any collection of 
information as defined by the PRA, does not apply to this rule. This 
rule amendment does not contain information collection requirements 
that

[[Page 4544]]

require the approval of the Office of Management and Budget.
---------------------------------------------------------------------------

    \19\ 44 U.S.C. 3507(d).
---------------------------------------------------------------------------

D. Consideration of Costs and Benefits

    Section 15(a) of the CEA \20\ requires the Commission to consider 
the costs and benefits of its action before issuing a new regulation. 
Section 15(a) of the CEA further specifies that costs and benefits 
shall be evaluated in light of five broad areas of market and public 
concern: (1) protection of market participants and the public; (2) 
efficiency, competitiveness, and financial integrity of futures 
markets; (3) price discovery; (4) sound risk management practices; and 
(5) other public interest considerations.
---------------------------------------------------------------------------

    \20\ 7 U.S.C. 19(a).
---------------------------------------------------------------------------

    The Commission believes that benefits of this rulemaking greatly 
outweigh the costs, if any. As the Commission understands, the 
statutory provisions by which it is making cost-of-living adjustments 
to the CMPs in Rule 143.8 were enacted to ensure that CMPs do not lose 
their deterrence value because of inflation. An analysis of the costs 
and benefits of these adjustments were made before enactment of the 
statutory provisions under which the Commission is operating, and limit 
the discretion of the Commission to the extent that there are no 
regulatory choices the Commission could make that would supersede the 
pre-enactment analysis with respect to the five factors enumerated in 
Section 15(a) of the CEA, or any other factors.
