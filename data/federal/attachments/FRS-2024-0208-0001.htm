SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION: The Economic Growth, Regulatory Relief, and 
Consumer Protection Act established at the Board an Insurance Policy 
Advisory Committee (IPAC) to advise the Board on international capital 
standards and other insurance matters. This notice advises individuals 
of the opportunity to be considered for appointment to the IPAC. To 
assist with the appointment of IPAC members, the Board considers 
information submitted by the candidate, public information, and any 
other relevant information the Board determines to consider.

Council Size and Terms

    The IPAC has at most 21 members. IPAC members serve staggered 
three-year terms. Members are appointed to three-year terms unless the 
Board appoints a member to fill a vacant unexpired term. A member that 
is appointed to serve a three-year term begins his or her service on 
the first January 1 occurring after his or her appointment. A member 
appointed to fill a vacant unexpired term serves for the remainder of 
the term. The Board provides a nominal honorarium and reimburses 
members only for their actual travel expenses, subject to Board policy.

Statement of Interest

    A Statement of Interest must contain the following information:
    <bullet> Full name;
    <bullet> Address;
    <bullet> Phone number; and
    <bullet> Email address.
    At their option, candidates may provide additional information for 
consideration.

Qualifications

    IPAC candidates should be insurance experts. The Board provides 
equal appointment opportunity to all persons without regard to race, 
color, religion, sex (including sexual orientation, gender identity, 
and pregnancy), national origin, age, disability, genetic information, 
or military service. In addition, the Board is committed to a diverse 
committee and seeks a diverse set of expert perspectives from the 
various sectors of the U.S. insurance industry including life 
insurance, property and casualty insurance and reinsurance, agents and 
brokers, academics, consumer advocates, and experts on issues facing 
underserved insurance communities and consumers. The Board also seeks 
relevant actuarial, legal, regulatory, and accounting expertise, as 
well as expertise on lines of business underwritten by its currently 
supervised population of insurance institutions.
    Members must be willing and able to participate in conference calls 
and prepare for and attend meetings in person. Membership and 
attendance is not delegable.
    By order of the Board of Governors of the Federal Reserve System, 
acting through the Director of the Division of Supervision and 
Regulation under delegated authority.

Ann E. Misback,
Secretary of the Board.
