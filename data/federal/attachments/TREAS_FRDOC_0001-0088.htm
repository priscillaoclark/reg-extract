Name Change of Two DHS Components

AGENCY: U.S. Customs and Border Protection, DHS; U.S. Immigration and 
Customs Enforcement, DHS; Department of the Treasury.

ACTION: Final rule.

-----------------------------------------------------------------------

SUMMARY: On March 31, 2007, the name of the Bureau of Customs and 
Border Protection changed to U.S. Customs and Border Protection (CBP) 
and the name of the Bureau of Immigration and Customs Enforcement 
changed to U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE). This final 
rule revises two chapter headings in title 19 of the Code of Federal 
Regulations to reflect the name changes for those two Department of 
Homeland Security (DHS) components.

DATES: Effective Date: March 16, 2010.

FOR FURTHER INFORMATION CONTACT: For CBP: Harold Singer, Director, 
Regulations and Disclosure Law Division, Office of International Trade, 
U.S. Customs and Border Protection, (202) 325-0101. For ICE: Jason J. 
Johnsen, Writer/Editor, Office of Policy, U.S. Immigration and Customs 
Enforcement, (202) 732-4245.

SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION:

Background

    On November 25, 2002, the President signed the Homeland Security 
Act of 2002, 6 U.S.C. 101 et seq., Public Law 107-296, (the ``HSA''), 
establishing the Department of Homeland Security (DHS). Pursuant to 
section 403(1) of the HSA (6 U.S.C. 203(1)), the U.S. Customs Service 
was transferred from the Department of the Treasury to DHS effective 
March 1, 2003. In addition, the Customs Service was renamed as the 
``Bureau of Customs and Border Protection'' pursuant to section 1502 of 
the HSA. Section 442 of the HSA (6 U.S.C. 252) established the ``Bureau 
of Border Security.'' Under section 1502 of the HSA, the Bureau of 
Border Security was renamed as the ``Bureau of Immigration and Customs 
Enforcement,'' effective March 1, 2003. The President's 
``Reorganization Plan Modification for the Department of Homeland 
Security,'' dated January 30, 2003, memorializes these name changes.
    On January 18, 2007, DHS notified Congress that it was changing the 
name of the Bureau of Customs and Border Protection to ``U.S. Customs 
and Border Protection (CBP)'' and the name of the Bureau of Immigration 
and Customs Enforcement to ``U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement 
(ICE).'' Pursuant to section 872(a)(2) of the HSA (6 U.S.C. 452(a)(2), 
notice of the name change was provided to Congress no later than 60 
days before the change could become effective. On April 23, 2007, a 
notice was published in the Federal Register to inform the public that 
DHS had changed the names of the two components effective March 31, 
2007. 72 FR 20131.
    This document revises the headings of chapters I and IV of title 19 
of the Code of Federal Regulations (19 CFR) to reflect the agency name 
changes as set forth in the Federal Register notice of April 23, 2007.

Inapplicability of Prior Public Notice and Delayed Effective Date 
Requirements

    This regulation involves matters relating to agency management and 
involves a technical change regarding the name of the two DHS 
components. For this reason, pursuant to 5 U.S.C. 553(a)(2), prior 
notice and comment is not required. Because this is not a substantive 
rule, publication and service of the rule thirty days before its 
effective date, pursuant to 5 U.S.C. 553(d), is likewise not required.

The Regulatory Flexibility Act and Executive Order 12866

    Because no notice of proposed rulemaking is required, the 
provisions of the Regulatory Flexibility Act (5 U.S.C. 601 et seq.) do 
not apply. Further, this amendment does not meet the criteria for a 
``significant regulatory action'' for purposes of Executive Order 
12866.

Amendments to the Regulations

0
For the reasons set forth above in the preamble, under the authority of 
6 U.S.C. 452, and the April 23, 2007, DHS Federal Register notice 
announcing the name change for CBP and ICE, the headings of chapters I 
and IV of title 19 of the Code of Federal Regulations are amended as 
set forth below:

1. Revise the chapter I heading to title 19 to read as follows.

Chapter I--U.S. Customs and Border Protection, Department of Homeland 
Security; Department of the Treasury

0
2. Revise the chapter IV heading to title 19 to read as follows.

Chapter IV--U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement; Department of

    Dated: March 10, 2010.

Secretary, Department of Homeland Security.
Timothy E. Skud,
Deputy Assistant Secretary, Tax, Tariff, and Trade Policy, Department 
of the Treasury.
