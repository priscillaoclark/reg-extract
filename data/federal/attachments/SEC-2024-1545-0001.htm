I. Self-Regulatory Organization's Statement of the Terms of Substance 
of the Proposed Rule Change

    Cboe EDGX Exchange, Inc. (the ``Exchange'' or ``EDGX'') proposes to 
adopt new functionality relating to the processing of auction 
responses. The text of the proposed rule change is provided in Exhibit 
5.
    The text of the proposed rule change is also available on the 
Exchange's website (<a href="http://markets.cboe.com/us/options/regulation/rule_filings/edgx/">http://markets.cboe.com/us/options/regulation/rule_filings/edgx/</a>), at the Exchange's Office of the Secretary, and at 
the Commission's Public Reference Room.

II. Self-Regulatory Organization's Statement of the Purpose of, and 
Statutory Basis for, the Proposed Rule Change

    In its filing with the Commission, the Exchange included statements 
concerning the purpose of and basis for the proposed rule change and 
discussed any comments it received on the proposed rule change. The 
text of these statements may be examined at the places specified in 
Item IV below. The Exchange has prepared summaries, set forth in 
sections A, B, and C below, of the most significant aspects of such 
statements.

A. Self-Regulatory Organization's Statement of the Purpose of, and 
Statutory Basis for, the Proposed Rule Change

1. Purpose
    The Exchange currently offers a variety of auction mechanisms which 
provide price improvement opportunities for eligible orders. 
Particularly, the Exchange offers the following auction mechanisms: 
Complex Order Auction (``COA''),\5\ Step Up Mechanism (``SUM''),\6\ 
Automated Improvement Mechanism (``AIM''),\7\ Complex AIM (``C-
AIM''),\8\ Solicitation Auction Mechanism (``SAM''),\9\ and Complex SAM 
(``C-SAM'').\10\ The Exchange notes that eligible orders (``auctioned 
order'') are electronically exposed for an Exchange-determined period 
(collectively referred to herein as ``auction response period'') in 
accordance with the applicable Exchange Rule, during which time Users 
may submit responses (collectively referred to herein as ``auction 
responses'' or ``auction response messages'') to an auction message. An 
auction response may only execute in the applicable auction and is 
cancelled if it does not execute during an auction. If an auction 
response is unable to be processed by the System during the auction 
response period, that auction response is unable to receive any 
execution opportunity or provide liquidity (and possible price 
improvement) on the Exchange.\11\
---------------------------------------------------------------------------

    \5\ See Rule 21.20(d).
    \6\ See Rule 21.18.
    \7\ See Rule 21.19.
    \8\ See Rule 21.22.
    \9\ See Rule 21.21.
    \10\ See Rule 21.23.
    \11\ The Exchange notes that its review of auction responses 
during August 2024 indicated that approximately 4.25% of auction 
responses had no opportunity to execute in their respective 
auctions, notwithstanding being submitted within the auction 
response period.
---------------------------------------------------------------------------

    By way of further background, Members may submit auction responses 
via logical port connectivity.\12\ Each logical port corresponds to a 
single running order handler application.\13\ Each order handler 
application processes the messages it receives from the connected 
Member. This processing includes determining whether the message 
contains the required information to enter the System and where to send 
that message within the System (i.e., to which matching engine). 
Messages are sent from an order handler application to a matching 
engine via User Datagram Protocol (``UDP''). The Exchange has multiple 
matching engines, each of which controls the book for one or more 
classes of options listed for trading on the Exchange. The Exchange may 
run multiple matching engine applications on a single server. Once at a 
matching engine, the message is received at a server Network Interface 
Card (``NIC''), which timestamps each message upon arrival and places 
it in a queue. Currently, each matching engine processes all messages 
it receives from a single queue from the NIC and prioritizes the 
processing of all message traffic, including auction responses, in the 
order in which the NIC received each message (i.e., in time priority).
---------------------------------------------------------------------------

    \12\ A User connects to the Exchange using a logical port 
available through an API, such as the industry-standard FIX or BOE 
protocol. Logical ports represent a technical port established by 
the Exchange within the Exchange's trading system for the delivery 
and/or receipt of trading messages, including orders, cancels, and 
auction responses.
    \13\ The Exchange has numerous order handlers and uses an 
algorithm to determine at random which ports connect to which order 
handlers. This algorithm attempts to spread out a single Member's 
ports across order handlers as well as balance the number of ports 
that connect to a single order handler.
---------------------------------------------------------------------------

    Auction response messages historically have waited in the same 
queue as all other order and quote message traffic. As such, if an 
auction response is submitted at a time where there is a deep queue of 
other message traffic such as mass cancellation messages or other 
orders and quotes, it is possible that the auction response may not be 
``processed'' by the System in sufficient time (i.e., prior to the end 
of the auction response period).\14\ Particularly, the queued auction 
response may not be able to participate in the applicable auction 
mechanism because the System had unprocessed (queued) messages at the 
time of the auction execution despite the fact that the User submitted 
the auction response prior to the end of the auction response period. 
Auctioned orders may therefore be missing out on potential price 
improvement that may have otherwise resulted if queued timely auction 
response(s) were able to participate in the auction.
---------------------------------------------------------------------------

    \14\ For example, it currently takes the Exchange's system an 
approximate average of 12 microseconds to process a single order/
quote or auction response message and, on average, approximately 79 
microseconds to process a mass cancel message. As such, under the 
current system, an auction response that is entered after a mass 
cancel message is more likely to be detrimentally delayed as 
compared to a mass cancel message that is entered after an auction 
response (i.e., a 79 microsecond ``wait time'' versus a 12 
microsecond ``wait time'').
---------------------------------------------------------------------------

    The Exchange proposes to adopt new functionality under Rule 21.14, 
new subparagraph (e), which would apply across all of its auction 
mechanisms to increase the likelihood that timely submitted auction 
responses may participate in the applicable auction, even during 
periods of high message traffic.\15\ Under the proposed functionality, 
at the time an auction response period ends, the System will continue 
to process its inbound queue for any messages that were received by the 
System before the end of the auction period (including auction 
messages) for up to an Exchange-determined period of time, not to 
exceed 100 milliseconds (which the Exchange may determine on a class-
by-class basis which would apply to all auction mechanisms and which 
would be announced with reasonable advanced notice via Exchange 
Notice). That is, any auction responses that were in the queue before 
the conclusion of the auction (as identified by the NIC timestamp on 
the message) would be processed as long as

[[Page 86858]]

the Exchange-determined time on a class-by-class basis (not to exceed 
100 milliseconds) is not exceeded. Only auction messages received prior 
to the execution of the applicable auction are eligible to be processed 
for that auction. The applicable auction will execute once all 
messages, including auction responses, received before the end time of 
the auction response period have been processed or the Exchange-
determined maximum time limit of up to 100 milliseconds has elapsed, 
whichever occurs first. This continuation of processing the queue for 
an additional amount of time for messages that were received before the 
end of the auction allows for auction responses that would otherwise 
have been canceled due to the conclusion of the auction response period 
to still have an opportunity to participate in the auction. This 
provides such responses with increased opportunities to participate in 
the auction, even during periods of high message traffic, thereby 
potentially providing customers with additional opportunities for price 
improvement, while still providing a processing cut off time to ensure 
auction executions aren't unduly delayed.
---------------------------------------------------------------------------

    \15\ Particularly, the proposed functionality would apply to the 
following Exchange auction mechanisms: COA, SUM, AIM, C-AIM, SAM, 
and C-SAM.
---------------------------------------------------------------------------

    By way of an example, if an auction with an auction response period 
set to 100 milliseconds were to start at 9:00:00 a.m., only auction 
responses that were able to be processed by the System by the 
conclusion of the auction at 9:00:100 would participate in the auction. 
Accordingly, if, for example, an auction response that was submitted at 
9:00:090 (within the auction time response period), is still in the 
message queue at 9:00:100, that response under the current System 
functionality would be canceled and not eligible to participate in the 
auction. Under the proposal, at 9:00:100, because the System continues 
to process all messages timestamped before 9:00:100, that same auction 
response submitted at 9:00:090 would not automatically be canceled but 
rather included in the auction as long as it was able to be processed 
within an additional 50 milliseconds, which is the additional 
processing time set by the Exchange and announced to market 
participants with reasonable advance notice via Exchange Notice for 
that class in this example. Once that auction response is up for 
processing (because the System processes messages sequentially in time 
order sequence), the response will be able to participate in the 
auction so long as it's processed by 9:00:150, notwithstanding such 
processing would occur after the 100-millisecond auction response 
period has concluded. Any auction responses for the pending auction 
that are still pending after the execution of the auction would be 
canceled.\16\ The Exchange notes that using the same example, if an 
auction response was submitted at 9:00:120, it would not be eligible 
for processing because the timestamp would identify it as being 
submitted outside the auction response period which was otherwise set 
to conclude at 9:00:100.
---------------------------------------------------------------------------

    \16\ If, for example, the System processed all messages received 
before 9:00:100 by 9:00:110, then the auction would execute at 
9:00:110 (i.e., the System does not need to wait until 9:00:150 to 
execute an auction if all messages submitted prior to the end time 
of the auction have been processed).
---------------------------------------------------------------------------

    The Exchange believes the proposed rule change will result in 
increased execution opportunities for liquidity providers that submit 
auction responses and enhance the potential for price improvement for 
orders submitted to each mechanism to the benefit of investors and 
public interest. Indeed, the Exchange believes the proposed 
functionality will increase the possibility that timely submitted 
auction responses are processed by the Exchange and have an opportunity 
for execution in the applicable auction mechanism, even if there is a 
deep pending message queue. The Exchange believes the proposed maximum 
amount of additional time for processing (i.e., 100 milliseconds) is 
both an adequate amount of time to provide pending auction responses 
with such execution opportunity, but also an amount minimal enough that 
impact to other message traffic, if any, would be de minimis. The 
Exchange also notes that it previously discussed the proposed maximum 
amount with market participants who indicated that 100 milliseconds was 
acceptable to them. The Exchange anticipates that in the vast majority 
of cases, the additional time needed after the conclusion of auction 
response period, if any, to process all pending auction responses will 
be shorter than the maximum 100 milliseconds. To the extent the 
Exchange determines a lesser amount of time would be sufficient, the 
Exchange could implement an additional amount of time for processing 
auction responses that is less than 100 milliseconds, which time would 
be announced with reasonable advance notice to market participants via 
Exchange Notice. Additionally, all message traffic (including auction 
responses) will continue to be processed in time-priority.
    The Exchange also believes the proposal will continue to allow the 
Exchange to set each auction response period to an amount of time that 
provides Members submitting responses with sufficient time to respond 
to, compete for, and provide price improvement for orders, but also 
continues to provide auctioned orders with quick executions that may 
reduce market and execution risk. Further, the Exchange believes some 
market participants choose to submit auction responses towards the end 
of an auction response period to better ensure the response is at a 
price that the market participant is willing to trade given the market 
at the time the auction response period concludes. As such, merely 
extending the auction response period in each auction would not itself 
prevent auction responses from continuing to miss the auction 
notwithstanding being timely submitted.
    Moreover, the Exchange notes that it recently adopted the same 
functionality on its affiliated exchange, Cboe Exchange, Inc (``Cboe 
Options'').\17\

2023) 88 FR 40878 (June 22, 2023) (SR-CBOE-2022-051) (Order Granting 
Accelerated Approval of Proposed Rule Change as Modified by 
Amendment Nos. 1 and 2 Relating to the Processing of Auction 
Responses).
---------------------------------------------------------------------------

Implementation
    The Exchange will announce via Exchange Notice the implementation 
date of implement the proposed rule change, which shall be no later 
than 60 days after the operative date of this rule filing.
2. Statutory Basis
    The Exchange believes the proposed rule change is consistent with 
the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 (the ``Act'') and the rules and 
regulations thereunder applicable to the Exchange and, in particular, 
the requirements of Section 6(b) of the Act.\18\ Specifically, the 
Exchange believes the proposed rule change is consistent with the 
Section 6(b)(5) \19\ requirements that the rules of an exchange be 
designed to prevent fraudulent and manipulative acts and practices, to 
promote just and equitable principles of trade, to foster cooperation 
and coordination with persons engaged in regulating, clearing, 
settling, processing information with respect to, and facilitating 
transactions in securities, to remove impediments to and perfect the 
mechanism of a free and open market and a national market system, and, 
in general, to protect investors and the public interest. Additionally, 
the Exchange believes the proposed rule change is consistent with the 
Section 6(b)(5) \20\ requirement that

[[Page 86859]]

the rules of an exchange not be designed to permit unfair 
discrimination between customers, issuers, brokers, or dealers.

---------------------------------------------------------------------------

    In particular, the Exchange believes modifying its System to allow 
it to potentially process more, if not all, timely submitted auction 
responses may provide further opportunities for auctioned orders to 
receive price improvement, which removes impediments to a free and open 
market and ultimately protects and benefits investors. In particular, 
the proposed rule change will continue to provide investors with timely 
processing of their options quote and order messages, while providing 
investors who submit auction orders with additional auction liquidity. 
Indeed, the proposed rule change may allow more investors additional 
opportunities to receive price improvement through an auction 
mechanism. Additionally, because the proposed functionality may provide 
liquidity providers that submit auction responses with additional 
execution opportunities in auctions, the Exchange believes they may be 
further encouraged to submit more auction responses, which may 
contribute to a deeper, more liquid auction process that provides 
investors with additional price improvement opportunities.
    The Exchange believes the proposed rule change will result in 
increased execution opportunities for liquidity providers that submit 
auction responses and enhance the potential for price improvement for 
orders submitted to each mechanism to the benefit of investors and 
public interest. As described above, the Exchange believes the proposed 
functionality will increase the possibility that timely submitted 
auction responses are processed by the Exchange and have an opportunity 
for execution in the applicable auction mechanism, even if there is a 
deep pending message queue. The Exchange believes the proposed maximum 
amount of additional time for processing (i.e., 100 milliseconds) is 
both an adequate amount of time to provide pending auction responses 
with such execution opportunity, but also an amount minimal enough that 
impact to other message traffic, if any, would be de minimis. The 
Exchange also discussed the proposed maximum amount of time with market 
participants who indicated that 100 milliseconds was acceptable to 
them. As represented above, the Exchange anticipates that in the vast 
majority of cases, the additional time needed after the conclusion of 
auction response period, if any, to process all pending auction 
responses will be shorter than the maximum 100 milliseconds. To the 
extent the Exchange determines a lesser amount of time would be 
sufficient, the Exchange could implement an additional amount of time 
for processing auction responses that is less than 100 milliseconds, 
which time would be announced with reasonable advance notice to market 
participants via Exchange Notice. Additionally, all message traffic 
(including auction responses) will continue to be processed in time-
priority.
    While the Exchange may increase the length of auction response 
periods to accommodate more auction responses, the Exchange believes 
the proposed functionality better addresses the issue of missed auction 
responses. Particularly, the Exchange believes the proposed rule change 
will accommodate more auction responses while also mitigating market 
risk that may accompany a longer auction period by setting the length 
of an auction response period to a timeframe that allows an adequate 
amount of time for Members to respond to an auction message and 
provides the auctioned order with fast executions. Additionally, the 
Exchange believes Members may wait until the end of an auction response 
period regardless of how long the Exchange sets it to in order to 
ensure they are comfortable with the price the response may execute at 
the conclusion of such auction. As such, extending the auction response 
period in each auction would not itself prevent auction responses from 
continuing to miss the auction notwithstanding being timely submitted.
    The Exchange believes adopting the proposed functionality for 
auction responses would also better provide customers with additional 
opportunities for price improvements with little to no impact to non-
auction response message traffic. Currently, auction responses account 
for an incredibly small fraction of message traffic submitted to the 
Exchange. Indeed, based on the Exchange's analysis in August 2024, 
auction response messages accounted for a mere 0.01% of all message 
traffic submitted to the Exchange. The Exchange believe the processing 
of such a small amount of message traffic, even after the conclusion of 
an auction response period, would therefore have de minimis, if any, 
impact on the processing of non-auction response messages waiting in 
the queue. The Exchange also notes that all messages are currently 
processed one at a time by the System. Therefore, the System still 
needs to ``process'' all pending auction responses, regardless of 
whether that processing involves canceling the pending auction response 
because it wasn't processed in time to participate in the auction or 
actually processing the response to participate in the auction. Either 
way, the non-auction response messages will still have to wait for 
processing of any pending responses ahead of it. Conversely, the 
current system may cause investors to miss out on opportunities to 
receive price improvement through the Exchange's auction mechanisms as 
the System is configured to cancel pending auction responses that 
``miss'' the auction execution, even if such responses were timely 
submitted but not processed due to the System being otherwise occupied 
processing messages in queue ahead of it. The Exchange therefore 
believes its proposal will make it more likely that the System 
processes timely submitted auction responses and includes them in 
applicable auctions, thus providing them with more opportunities to 
execute against auctioned orders, even during periods of high message 
traffic.
    The Exchange believes the proposed rule change is not designed to 
permit unfair discrimination between market participants as all market 
participants are allowed to submit auction responses. Additionally, the 
Exchange believes it's reasonable to adopt the proposed functionality 
for auction responses as compared to other messages because auction 
responses are submitted only for the purpose of executing (and possibly 
providing price improvement) in auctions with short durations, whereas 
other messages are generally submitted to rest in or execute against 
the book (and generally not used to submit liquidity into auctions). As 
discussed above, the Exchange believes the benefits that result from 
the adoption of the proposed functionality for auction responses would 
outweigh any potential negative impact to other message traffic, 
including customer orders, which have an incredibly low chance of being 
affected by the proposed change as discussed above and which continue 
to receive priority allocation in any event.

B. Self-Regulatory Organization's Statement on Burden on Competition

    The Exchange does not believe that the proposed rule change will 
impose any burden on competition that is not necessary or appropriate 
in furtherance of the purposes of the Act. The Exchange does not 
believe that the proposed changes will impose any burden on intra-
market competition that is not necessary or appropriate in furtherance 
of the purposes of the Act, as the proposed rule change would apply 
equally to all Members that submit auction responses. As noted

[[Page 86860]]

above, all market participants are able to submit auction responses. 
Additionally, the Exchange believes the adoption of the proposed 
functionality for auction responses would have little to no impact on 
non-auction response message traffic. As discussed, auction response 
messages account for an incredibly small fraction of message traffic 
submitted to the Exchange. The Exchange therefore believes the 
processing of such a small amount of message traffic by using the 
functionality would have a de minimis, if any, impact on the processing 
of non-auction response messages. Moreover, the Exchange believes it's 
reasonable to adopt the proposed functionality for auction responses as 
compared to other messages because auction responses are submitted only 
for the purpose of executing (and possibly providing price improvement) 
in auctions with short durations, whereas other messages are generally 
submitted to rest in or execute against the book (and generally not 
used to submit liquidity into auctions). Lastly, the Exchange does not 
believe the proposed rule change will impose any burden on inter-market 
competition that is not necessary or appropriate in furtherance of the 
purposes of the Act, as the proposed change affects how the System 
processes auction responses that may only participate in auctions that 
occur on the Exchange.

C. Self-Regulatory Organization's Statement on Comments on the Proposed 
Rule Change Received From Members, Participants, or Others

    The Exchange neither solicited nor received comments on the 
proposed rule change.

III. Date of Effectiveness of the Proposed Rule Change and Timing for 
Commission Action

    The Exchange has filed the proposed rule change pursuant to Section 
19(b)(3)(A)(iii) of the Act \21\ and Rule 19b-4(f)(6) thereunder.\22\ 
Because the proposed rule change does not: (i) significantly affect the 
protection of investors or the public interest; (ii) impose any 
significant burden on competition; and (iii) become operative prior to 
30 days from the date on which it was filed, or such shorter time as 
the Commission may designate, if consistent with the protection of 
investors and the public interest, the proposed rule change has become 
effective pursuant to Section 19(b)(3)(A) of the Act \23\ and Rule 19b-
4(f)(6)(iii) thereunder.\24\
---------------------------------------------------------------------------

    \21\ 15 U.S.C. 78s(b)(3)(A)(iii).
    \22\ 17 CFR 240.19b-4(f)(6).
    \23\ 15 U.S.C. 78s(b)(3)(A).
    \24\ 17 CFR 240.19b-4(f)(6). In addition, Rule 19b-4(f)(6)(iii) 
requires the Exchange to give the Commission written notice of the 
Exchange's intent to file the proposed rule change, along with a 
brief description and text of the proposed rule change, at least 
five business days prior to the date of filing of the proposed rule 
change, or such shorter time as designated by the Commission. The 
Exchange has satisfied this requirement.
---------------------------------------------------------------------------

    A proposed rule change filed under Rule 19b-4(f)(6) \25\ normally 
does not become operative prior to 30 days after the date of the 
filing. However, pursuant to Rule 19b-4(f)(6)(iii),\26\ the Commission 
may designate a shorter time if such action is consistent with the 
protection of investors and the public interest. The Exchange has asked 
the Commission to waive the 30-day operative delay so that the proposal 
may become operative immediately upon filing. As discussed above, the 
Exchange states that this proposed rule change provides substantively 
identical functionality as a rule previously approved by the Commission 
from the Exchange's affiliate, Cboe Options.\27\ The Exchange believes 
that the waiver of the operative delay will protect investors by 
allowing the Exchange to implement the proposed functionality as soon 
as possible, which will benefit investors as the System will 
potentially process more, if not all, timely submitted auction 
responses. The Commission believes that the waiver of the operative 
delay is consistent with the protection of investors and the public 
interest because it may permit the Exchange to provide further 
opportunities for auctioned orders to receive price improvement, which 
may in turn remove impediments to a free and open market and benefit 
investors. Accordingly, the Commission hereby waives the 30-day 
operative delay and designates the proposal operative upon filing.\28\

    \28\ For purposes only of waiving the 30-day operative delay, 
the Commission has considered the proposed rule's impact on 
efficiency, competition, and capital formation. See 15 U.S.C. 
78c(f).
---------------------------------------------------------------------------

    At any time within 60 days of the filing of this proposed rule 
change, the Commission summarily may temporarily suspend such rule 
change if it appears to the Commission that such action is necessary or 
appropriate in the public interest, for the protection of investors, or 
otherwise in furtherance of the purposes of the Act. If the Commission 
takes such action, the Commission shall institute proceedings under 
Section 19(b)(2)(B) \29\ of the Act to determine whether the proposed 
rule change should be approved or disapproved.
