Practices.
    Type of Review: Revision of a currently approved collection.
    Abstract: Section 342 of the Dodd-Frank Wall Street Reform and 
Consumer Protection Act of 2010 (Act) instructed each agency Office of 
Minority and Women Inclusion (OMWI) director to develop standards for 
assessing the diversity policies and practices of entities regulated by 
each agency. The Agencies worked together to develop joint standards 
and publish a policy statement in the Federal Register. The Policy 
Statement contains a collection of information. The NCUA 15004, 
``Annual Voluntary Credit Union Diversity Self-Assessment,'' can be 
used by federally insured credit unions to perform their assessment and 
to submit information to NCUA.

    Estimated Number of Responses per Respondent: 1.

credit (including credit cards) to members. Section 701.21 governs the 
requirements related to loans to members and lines of credit to members 
for FCUs. Additionally, Part 741 established requirements for all 
federally insured credit unions (both Federal and state charters) 
related to loans to members and lines of credit union members. NCUA 
reviews the information collections to ensure compliance with 
applicable regulations and laws, and to assess the safety and soundness 
of the credit union's lending program.

will be summarized and included in the request for Office of Management 
and Budget approval. All comments will become a matter of public 
record. The public is invited to submit comments concerning: (a) 
whether the collection of information is necessary for the proper 
performance of the function of the agency, including whether the 
information will have practical utility; (b) the accuracy of the 
agency's estimate of the burden of the collection of information, 
including the validity of the methodology and assumptions used; (c) 
ways to enhance the quality, utility, and clarity of the information to 
be collected; and (d) ways to minimize the burden of the collection of 
the information on the respondents, including the use of automated 
collection techniques or other forms of information technology.
