SECURITIES AND EXCHANGE COMMISSION

[SEC File No. 270-462, OMB Control No. 3235-0521]


Submission for OMB Review; Comment Request; Extension: Rule 425

Upon Written Request Copies Available From: Securities and Exchange 
Commission, Office of FOIA Services, 100 F Street NE, Washington, DC 
20549-2736

    Notice is hereby given that, pursuant to the Paperwork Reduction 
Act of 1995 (44 U.S.C. 3501 et seq.), the Securities and Exchange 
Commission (``Commission'') has submitted to the Office of Management 
and Budget this request for extension of the previously approved 
collection of information discussed below.
    Rule 425 (17 CFR 230.425) under the Securities Act of 1933 (15 
U.S.C. 77a et seq.) requires the filing of certain prospectuses and 
communications under Rule 135 (17 CFR 230.135) and Rule 165 (17 CFR 
230.165) in connection with business combination transactions. The 
purpose of the rule is to permit more oral and written communications 
with shareholders about tender offers, mergers and other business 
combination transactions on a more-timely basis, so long as the written 
communications are filed on the date of first use. The information 
provided under Rule 425 is made available to the public upon request. 
Also, the information provided under Rule 425 is mandatory. 
Approximately 7,160 issuers file communications under Rule 425 at an 
estimated 0.25 hours per response for a total of 1,790 annual burden 
hours (0.25 hours per response x 7,160 responses).
    An agency may not conduct or sponsor, and a person is not required 
to respond to, a collection of information unless it displays a 
currently valid control number.
    The public may view background documentation for this information 
collection at the following website: <a href="http://www.reginfo.gov">www.reginfo.gov</a>. Find this 
particular information collection by selecting ``Currently under 30-day 
Review--Open for Public Comments'' or by using the search function. 
Written comments and recommendations for the proposed information 
collection should be sent within 30 days of publication of this notice 
by January 10, 2024 to (i) <a href="http://www.reginfo.gov/public/do/PRAMain">www.reginfo.gov/public/do/PRAMain</a> and (ii)

Exchange Commission, c/o John Pezzullo, 100 F Street NE, Washington, DC
