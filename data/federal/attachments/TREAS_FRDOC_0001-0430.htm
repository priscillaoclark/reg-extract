Extension of Import Restrictions on Archaeological and 
Ethnological Materials of Libya

AGENCY: U.S. Customs and Border Protection, Department of Homeland 
Security; Department of the Treasury.

ACTION: Final rule.

-----------------------------------------------------------------------

SUMMARY: This document amends the U.S. Customs and Border Protection 
(CBP) regulations to reflect an extension of import restrictions on 
certain categories of archaeological and ethnological materials of 
Libya. The Assistant Secretary for Educational and Cultural Affairs, 
United States Department of State, has made the requisite 
determinations for extending the import restrictions and no cause for 
suspension exists. The restrictions, originally imposed by CBP Decision 
(CBP Dec.) 18-07, will be extended for an additional five-year period, 
through February 23, 2028, and the CBP regulations are being amended to 
reflect this extension. The Designated List of archaeological and 
ethnological material of Libya to which the restrictions apply is 
reproduced below with a statement clarifying that ethnological material 
on the Designated List excludes Jewish ceremonial and ritual objects.

DATES: Effective on February 23, 2023.

SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION: 

Background

    Under the Convention on Cultural Property Implementation Act (Pub. 
L. 97-446, 19 U.S.C. 2601 et seq.) (CPIA), which implements the 1970 
United Nations Educational, Scientific and Cultural Organization 
(UNESCO) Convention on the Means of Prohibiting and Preventing the 
Illicit Import, Export and Transfer of Ownership of Cultural Property 
(823 U.N.T.S. 231 (1972)) (Convention), the United States may enter 
into international agreements with another State Party to the 
Convention to impose import restrictions on eligible archaeological and 
ethnological materials. Under the CPIA and the applicable U.S. Customs 
and Border Protection (CBP) regulations, found in section 12.104 of 
Title 19 of the Code of Federal Regulations (19 CFR 12.104), the 
restrictions are effective for no more than five years beginning on the 
date on which an agreement enters into force with respect to the United 
States (19 U.S.C. 2602(b)). This period may be extended for additional 
periods, each extension not to exceed five years, if it is determined 
that the factors justifying the initial agreement still pertain and no 
cause for suspension of the agreement exists (19 U.S.C. 2602(e); 19 CFR 
12.104g(a)). In certain limited circumstances, the CPIA authorizes the 
imposition of restrictions on an emergency basis (19 U.S.C. 2603). The 
emergency restrictions are effective for no more than five years from 
the date of the State Party's request and may be extended for three 
years where it is determined that the emergency condition continues to 
apply with respect to the covered material (19 U.S.C. 2603(c)(3)). 
These restrictions may also be continued pursuant to an agreement 
concluded within the meaning of the Act (19 U.S.C. 2603(c)(4)).
    On December 5, 2017, CBP published a final rule, CBP Dec. 17-19 (82 
FR 57346), amending 19 CFR 12.104g(b) to reflect the imposition of 
emergency restrictions on the importation of certain categories of 
archaeological and ethnological materials of Libya, pursuant to 19 
U.S.C. 2603(c). On February 23, 2018, the United States entered into a 
memorandum of understanding (2018 MOU) with the Government of Libya 
(Libya), concerning the imposition of import restrictions on 
archaeological and ethnological material of Libya. The 2018 MOU covered 
the same archaeological and ethnological materials subject to the 
emergency restrictions.
    On July 9, 2018, CBP published a final rule, CBP Dec. 18-07, in the 
Federal Register (83 FR 31654) amending 19 CFR 12.104g(a) to reflect 
the imposition of restrictions pursuant to the 2018 MOU. CBP Dec. 18-07 
extended the import restrictions implemented in 19 CFR 12.104g(b) by 
CBP Dec. 17-19 for a five-year period, through February 23, 2023.
    On June 21, 2022, the United States Department of State proposed in 
the Federal Register (87 FR 36911) to extend the MOU between the United 
States and Libya concerning the import restrictions on certain 
categories of archaeological and ethnological material from Libya. On 
December 14, 2022, after considering the views and recommendations of 
the Cultural Property Advisory Committee, the Assistant Secretary for 
Educational and Cultural Affairs, United States Department of State, 
determined that the cultural heritage of Libya continues to be in 
jeopardy from pillage of certain archeological and ethnological 
materials, and that the import restrictions should be extended for an 
additional five years, pursuant to 19 U.S.C. 2602(e). Following the 
exchange of diplomatic notes, the United States Department of State and 
the Ministry of Foreign Affairs of the Government of Libya have agreed 
to extend the 2018 MOU for an additional five-year period.
    Accordingly, CBP is amending 19 CFR 12.104g(a) to reflect the 
extension of the import restrictions through February 23, 2028, and is 
adding a statement to the Designated List clarifying that Jewish 
ceremonial and ritual objects are not covered by import restrictions on 
ethnological material. Importation of designated material from Libya 
continues to be restricted through that date unless the conditions set 
forth in 19 U.S.C. 2606 and 19 CFR 12.104c are met.
    The Designated List and additional information may also be found at 
the following website address: <a href="https://eca.state.gov/cultural-heritage-center/cultural-property/current-agreements-and-import-restrictions">https://eca.state.gov/cultural-heritage-center/cultural-property/current-agreements-and-import-restrictions</a> by 
selecting the material for ``Libya.'' The designated list is included 
below with the addition of the clarifying statement on Jewish 
ceremonial and ritual objects.

Designated List

    The bilateral agreement between Libya and the United States covers 
the material set forth below in a Designated List of Archaeological and 
Ethnological Material of Libya. Importation of material on this list is 
restricted unless the material is accompanied by documentation 
certifying that the material left Libya legally and not in violation of 
the export laws of Libya. In order to clarify certain provisions of the 
Designated List contained CBP Dec. 18-07, the Designated List has been 
updated in this document with minor

[[Page 11389]]

revisions clarifying that Jewish ceremonial and ritual objects are not 
covered by import restrictions on ethnological material.
    The Designated List covers archaeological material of Libya and 
Ottoman ethnological material of Libya (as defined in section 302 of 
the Convention on Cultural Property Implementation Act (19 U.S.C. 
2601)), including, but not limited to, the following types of material. 
The archaeological material represents the following periods and 
cultures: Paleolithic, Neolithic, Punic, Greek, Roman, Byzantine, 
Islamic and Ottoman dating approximately 12,000 B.C. to 1750 A.D. The 
ethnological material represents categories of Ottoman objects derived 
from sites of Islamic cultural importance, made by a nonindustrial 
society (Ottoman Libya), and important to the knowledge of the history 
of Islamic Ottoman society in Libya from 1551 A.D. through 1911 A.D. 
This would exclude Jewish ceremonial and ritual objects.
    The Designated List set forth below is representative only. Any 
dimensions are approximate.

Inapplicability of Notice and Delayed Effective Date

    This amendment involves a foreign affairs function of the United 
States and is, therefore, being made without notice or public procedure 
under 5 U.S.C. 553(a)(1). For the same reason, a delayed effective date 
is not required under 5 U.S.C. 553(d)(3).

Regulatory Flexibility Act

    Because no notice of proposed rulemaking is required, the 
provisions of the Regulatory Flexibility Act (5 U.S.C. 601 et seq.) do 
not apply.

Executive Order 12866

    CBP has determined that this document is not a regulation or rule 
subject to the provisions of Executive Order 12866 because it pertains 
to a foreign affairs function of the United States, as described above, 
and therefore is specifically exempted by section 3(d)(2) of Executive 
Order 12866.

Signing Authority

    This regulation is being issued in accordance with 19 CFR 
0.1(a)(1), pertaining to the Secretary of the Treasury's authority (or 
that of his/her delegate) to approve regulations related to customs 
revenue functions.
