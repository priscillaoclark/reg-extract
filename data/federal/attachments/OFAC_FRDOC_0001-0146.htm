Background

    On September 23, 2001, the President issued Executive Order 13224 
(the ``Order'') pursuant to authorities including the International 
Emergency Economic Powers Act, 50 U.S.C. 1701-1706, and the United 
Nations Participation Act of 1945, 22 U.S.C. 287c. In the Order, the 
President declared a national emergency to address grave acts of 
terrorism and threats of terrorism committed by foreign terrorists, 
including the September 11, 2001, terrorist attacks in New York and 
Pennsylvania and at the Pentagon. The Order imposes economic sanctions 
on persons who have committed, pose a significant risk of committing, 
or support acts of terrorism. The President identified in the Annex to 
the Order, as amended by Executive Order 13268 of July 2, 2002, 13 
individuals and 16 entities as subject to the economic sanctions. The 
Order was further amended by Executive Order 13284 of January 23, 2003, 
to reflect the creation of the Department of Homeland Security.
    Section 1 of the Order blocks, with certain exceptions, all 
property and interests in property that are in or hereafter come within 
the United States or the possession or control of United States 
persons, of: (1) Foreign persons listed in the Annex to the Order; (2) 
foreign persons determined by the Secretary of State, in consultation 
with the Secretary of the Treasury, the Secretary of the Department of 
Homeland Security and the Attorney General, to have committed, or to 
pose a significant risk of committing, acts of terrorism that threaten 
the security of U.S. nationals or the national security, foreign 
policy, or economy of the United States; (3) persons determined by the 
Secretary of the Treasury, in consultation with the Departments of 
State, Homeland Security and Justice, to be owned or controlled by, or 
to act for or on behalf of those persons listed in the Annex to the 
Order or those persons determined to be subject to subsection 1(b), 
1(c), or 1(d)(i) of the Order; and (4) except as provided in section 5 
of the Order and after such consultation, if any, with foreign 
authorities as the Secretary of State, in consultation with the 
Secretary of the Treasury, the Secretary of the Department of Homeland 
Security and the Attorney General, deems appropriate in the exercise of 
his discretion, persons determined by the Secretary of the Treasury, in 
consultation with the Departments of State, Homeland Security and 
Justice, to assist in, sponsor, or provide financial, material, or 
technological support for, or financial or other services to or in 
support of, such acts of terrorism or those persons listed in the Annex 
to the Order or determined to be subject to the Order or to be 
otherwise associated with those persons listed in the Annex to the 
Order or those persons determined to be subject to subsection 1(b), 
1(c), or 1(d)(i) of the Order.
    The Global Terrorism Sanctions Regulations, 31 CFR part 594, 
implement the Order and delegate to the Director of OFAC the Secretary 
of the Treasury's authorities pursuant thereto. 31 CFR 594.802. On July 
12, 2010 the Director of OFAC, in consultation with the Departments of 
State, Homeland Security, Justice and other relevant agencies, 
designated ANWAR AL-AULAQI as an individual whose property and 
interests in property are

[[Page 43234]]

blocked pursuant to the Order and the GTSR for, inter alia, acting for 
or on behalf of al-Qa'ida in the Arabian Peninsula (AQAP) pursuant to 
subsection 1(c) of the Order and for providing financial, material or 
technological support for, or other services to or in support of, acts 
of terrorism pursuant to subsection 1(d)(i) of the Order.
    ANWAR AL-AULAQI, a dual U.S.-Yemeni citizen, is a leader of al-
Qa'ida in the Arabian Peninsula (AQAP), a Yemen-based terrorist group 
that has claimed responsibility for numerous terrorist acts against 
Saudi, Korean, Yemeni, and U.S. targets since its inception in January 
2009. ANWAR AL-AULAQI has pledged an oath of loyalty to AQAP emir, 
Nasir al-Wahishi, and is playing a key role in setting the strategic 
direction for AQAP. ANWAR AL-AULAQI has also recruited individuals to 
join AQAP, facilitated training at camps in Yemen in support of acts of 
terrorism, and helped focus AQAP's attention on planning attacks on 
U.S. interests.
    Since late 2009, ANWAR AL-AULAQI has taken on an increasingly 
operational role in the group, including preparing Umar Farouk 
Abdulmutallab, who attempted to detonate an explosive device aboard a 
Northwest Airlines flight from Amsterdam to Detroit on Christmas Day 
2009, for his operation. In November 2009, while in Yemen, 
Abdulmutallab swore allegiance to the emir of AQAP and shortly 
thereafter received instructions from ANWAR AL-AULAQI to detonate an 
explosive device aboard a U.S. airplane over U.S. airspace. After 
receiving this direction from ANWAR AL-AULAQI, Abdulmutallab obtained 
the explosive device he used in the attempted Christmas Day attack.
    ANWAR AL-AULAQI was imprisoned in Yemen in 2006 on charges of 
kidnapping for ransom and being involved in an al-Qa'ida plot to kidnap 
a U.S. official, but was released from jail in December 2007 and 
subsequently went into hiding in Yemen.
    As a result of this designation, all property and interests in 
property of ANWAR AL-AULAQI that are or hereafter come within the 
United States or within the possession or control of U.S. persons, 
including their overseas branches, are blocked. Blocked property may 
not be transferred, sold or otherwise dealt in without authorization. 
Any transaction or dealing by a U.S. person, or within the United 
States, in any property or interests in property of ANWAR AL-AULAQI is 
prohibited unless authorized, as is any transaction or dealing that 
evades or avoids this prohibition. It is also unlawful for any person 
to conspire to violate, or cause a violation of, this prohibition.
    Certain transactions that are otherwise prohibited by the Order and 
the GTSR are authorized by pursuant to general licenses set forth in 
subpart E of the GTSR. In other cases, OFAC has discretion to issue 
licenses authorizing specific transactions that are otherwise 
prohibited by the Order and the GTSR. All requests for specific 
licenses should be made in writing to the Assistant Director for 
Licensing, U.S. Department of the Treasury, Office of Foreign Assets 
Control, 1500 Pennsylvania Avenue, NW., Washington, DC 20220. Licensing 
procedures are set forth in sections 501.801-802 of the Reporting, 
Procedures and Penalties Regulations (``RPPR''), 31 CFR Part 501. The 
RPPR also provide procedures for submitting requests for unblocking 
funds and reconsideration of a designation. 31 CFR 501.806-807.
    The designated individual is as follows:
    1. AL-AULAQI, Anwar (a.k.a. AL-AWLAKI, Anwar; a.k.a. AL-AWLAQI, 
Anwar; a.k.a. AULAQI, Anwar Nasser; a.k.a. AULAQI, Anwar Nasser
