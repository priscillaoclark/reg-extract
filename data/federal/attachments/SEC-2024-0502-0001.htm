SECURITIES AND EXCHANGE COMMISSION

[SEC File No. 270-771, OMB Control No. 3235-0752]


Proposed Collection; Comment Request; Extension: Rule 18a-9

Upon Written Request, Copies Available From: Securities and Exchange 
Commission, Office of FOIA Services, 100 F Street NE, Washington, DC 
20549-2736

    Notice is hereby given that pursuant to the Paperwork Reduction Act 
of 1995 (``PRA'') (44 U.S.C. 3501 et seq.), the Securities and Exchange 
Commission (``Commission'') is soliciting comments on the existing 
collection of information provided for in Rule 18a-9 (17 CFR 240.18a-
9), under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 (15 U.S.C. 78a et seq.). 
The Commission plans to submit this existing collection of information 
to the Office of Management and Budget (``OMB'') for extension and 
approval.
    Rule 18a-9, which is modeled on Exchange Act Rule 17-13, 
establishes a securities count program for security-based swap dealers 
not dually registered as a broker-dealer or regulated by a prudential 
regulator (``stand-alone SBSDs''). Specifically, Rule 18a-9 requires 
stand-alone SBSDs to examine and count the securities they physically 
hold, account for the securities that are subject to their control and 
direction but are not in their physical possession, verify the 
locations of securities under certain circumstances, and compare the 
results of the count and verification with their records.
    Stand-alone SBSDs are required to perform a securities count each 
quarter, either as of a date certain or on a cyclical basis. Rule 18a-9 
requires stand-alone SBSDs to note any discrepancies between the count 
and the firm's records, and to record in the firm's record any 
discrepancies that remain unresolved seven business days after the date 
of the examination, count, and verification.
    The Commission estimates that the total hour burden under Rule 18a-
6 is approximately 1,100 hours per year.
    Written comments are invited on: (a) whether the proposed 
collection of information is necessary for the proper performance of 
the functions of the Commission, including whether the information 
shall have practical utility; (b) the accuracy of the Commission's 
estimates of the burden of the proposed collection of information; (c) 
ways to enhance the quality, utility, and clarity of the information 
collected; and (d) ways to minimize the burden of the collection of 
information on respondents, including through the use of automated 
collection techniques or other forms of information technology. 
Consideration will be given to comments and suggestions submitted by 
June 10, 2024.
    An agency may not conduct or sponsor, and a person is not required 
to respond to, a collection of information unless it displays a 
currently valid OMB control number.
    Please direct your written comments to: David Bottom, Director/
Chief Information Officer, Securities and Exchange Commission, c/o John 
Pezzullo, 100 F Street NE, Washington, DC 20549, or send an email to:

Sherry R. Haywood,
Assistant Secretary.
