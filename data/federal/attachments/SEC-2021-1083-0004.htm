SECURITIES AND EXCHANGE COMMISSION

[SEC File No. 270-620, OMB Control No. 3235-0675]


Submission for OMB Review; Comment Request; Extension: Rule 15Ga-
2 and Form ABS-15G

Upon Written Request Copies Available From: Securities and Exchange 
Commission, Office of FOIA Services, 100 F Street NE, Washington, DC 
20549-2736

    Notice is hereby given that, pursuant to the Paperwork Reduction 
Act of 1995 (44 U.S.C. 3501 et seq.), the Securities and Exchange 
Commission (``Commission'') has submitted to the Office of Management 
and Budget this request for extension of the previously approved 
collection of information discussed below.
    Rule 15Ga-2 and Form ABS-15G (17 CFR 249.1400) is used for reports 
of information required under Rule 15Ga-1 and Rule 15Ga-2 (17 CFR 
240.15Ga-1) (17 CFR 240.15Ga-2) of the Exchange Act of 1934 (``Exchange 
Act''). Exchange Act Rule 15Ga-1 requires asset-backed securitizers to 
provide disclosure regarding fulfilled an unfulfilled repurchase 
requests with respect to asset-backed securities. The purpose of the 
information collected on Form ABS-15G is to implement the disclosure 
requirements of Section 943 of the Dodd-Frank Wall Street Reform and 
Consumer Protection Act to provide information regarding the use of 
representations and warranties in the asset-backed securities markets.
    Form ABS-15G is a collection of information required by Rules 15Ga-
1 and 15Ga-2 under the Exchange Act. For just Rule 15Ga-1, Form ABS-15G 
takes approximately 27.2234 hours per response and is filed by 
approximately 1,142 respondents. We estimate that 75% of the 27.2234 
hours per response (20.4176 hours) is prepared by the filer for a total 
annual reporting burden of 23,317 hours (20.4176 hours per response x 
1,142 responses).
    For just Rule 15Ga-2, Form ABS-15G takes approximately 2.1279 hours 
per response and is filed by approximately 864 respondents. We estimate 
that 100% of the 2.1279 hours per response (2.1279 hours) is prepared 
by the filer for a total annual reporting burden of 1,839 hours (2.1279 
hours per response x 864 responses).
    Rule 15Ga-1 and Rule 15Ga-2 combined filing on Form ABS-15G we 
estimate that approximately 2006 securitizers will file Form ABS-15G 
annually at estimated (16.7205 hours) burden hours per response. In 
addition, we estimate that 75% of the 16.7205 hours per response 
(12.5403 hours) is carried internally by the securitizers for a total 
annual reporting burden of 25,156 hours (12.5403 hours per response x 
2006 responses).
    An agency may not conduct or sponsor, and a person is not required 
to respond to, a collection of information unless it displays a 
currently valid control number.
    Public Comment Instructions: The 30-day public comment period for 
this information collection request opens on December 12, 2024 and 
closes at the end of the day on January 13, 2025. The public may view
