SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION: Under the PRA, 44 U.S.C. 3501 et seq., 
Federal agencies must obtain approval from the Office of Management and 
Budget (``OMB'') for each collection of information they conduct or 
sponsor. ``Collection of Information'' is defined in 44 U.S.C. 3502(3) 
and 5 CFR 1320.3 and includes agency requests or requirements that 
members of the public submit reports, keep records, or provide 
information to a third party. Section 3506(c)(2)(A) of the PRA, 44 
U.S.C. 3506(c)(2)(A), requires Federal agencies to provide a 60-day 
notice in the Federal Register concerning each proposed collection of 
information, including each proposed extension of an existing 
collection of information, before submitting the collection to OMB for 
approval. To comply with this requirement, the CFTC is publishing 
notice of the proposed extension of the existing collections of 
information listed below. An agency may not conduct or sponsor, and a 
person is not required to respond to, a collection of information 
unless it displays a currently valid OMB control number.\1\

effective date of their registration.
    <bullet> Regulation 5.11(a)(2) requires RFEDs to submit certain

    <bullet> Regulation 5.12(g) states that, in the event that an RFED

in Regulation 5.12(b), the RFED may file an application for an 
extension of time with its self-regulatory organization.
    <bullet> Regulation 5.13(a) requires RFEDs and FCMs to provide

current ledgers of each transaction affecting its asset, liability, 
income, expense and capital accounts.
    <bullet> Regulation 5.18(g) requires each RFED, FCM, CPO, CTA, and 
IB subject to part 5 to maintain a record of all communications

    <bullet> Regulation 5.18(j) requires the chief compliance officer 
of each RFED and FCM to certify annually that the firm has in place 
processes to establish, maintain, review, modify and test policies and 
procedures reasonably designed to achieve compliance with the Act, 
rules, regulations and orders thereunder.
    <bullet> Regulation 5.19 requires each RFED, FCM, CPO, CTA, and IB 
subject to part 5 to submit to the Commission copies of any dispositive 
or partially dispositive decision for which a notice of appeal has been 
filed in any material legal proceeding (1) to which the firm is a party 
to or to which its property or assets is subject with respect to retail

    The rules establish reporting and recordkeeping requirements that 
are necessary to implement the provisions of the Food, Conservation, 
and Energy Act of 2008 \2\ regarding off-exchange transactions in 
foreign currency with members of the public. The rules are intended to 
promote customer protection by providing safeguards against 
irresponsible or fraudulent business practices.\3\
