SECURITIES AND EXCHANGE COMMISSION

[SEC File No. 270-517, OMB Control No. 3235-0575]


Proposed Collection; Comment Request; Extension: Regulation AC

Upon Written Request, Copies Available From: Securities and Exchange 
Commission, Office of FOIA Services, 100 F Street NE, Washington, DC 
20549-2736

    Notice is hereby given that pursuant to the Paperwork Reduction Act 
of 1995 (``PRA'') (44 U.S.C. 3501 et seq.), the Securities and Exchange 
Commission (``Commission'') is soliciting comments on the existing 
collection of information provided for in Regulation Analyst 
Certification (``Regulation AC'') (17 CFR 242.500-505, under the 
Securities Exchange Act of 1934 (15 U.S.C. 78a et seq.)). The 
Commission plans to submit this existing collection of information to 
the Office of Management and Budget (``OMB'') for extension and 
approval.
    Regulation AC requires that research reports published, circulated, 
or provided by a broker or dealer or covered person contain a statement 
attesting that the views expressed in each research report accurately 
reflect the analyst's personal views and whether or not the research 
analyst received or will receive any compensation in connection with 
the views or recommendations expressed in the research report. 
Regulation AC also requires broker-dealers to, on a quarterly basis, 
make, keep, and maintain records of research analyst statements 
regarding whether the views expressed in public appearances accurately 
reflected the analyst's personal views, and whether any part of the 
analyst's compensation is related to the specific recommendations or 
views expressed in the public appearance. Regulation AC also requires 
that research prepared by foreign persons be presented to U.S. persons 
pursuant to Securities Exchange Act Rule 15a-6 and that broker-dealers 
notify associated persons if they would be covered by the regulation. 
Regulation AC excludes the news media from its coverage.
    The Commission estimates that Regulation AC imposes an aggregate 
annual time burden of approximately 41,384 hours. The Commission 
estimates that the total annual internal cost of compliance for the 
41,384 hours is approximately $22,891,896.
    Written comments are invited on: (a) whether the proposed 
collection of information is necessary for the proper performance of 
the functions of the Commission, including whether the information 
shall have practical utility; (b) the accuracy of the Commission's 
estimates of the burden of the proposed collection of information; (c) 
ways to enhance the quality, utility, and clarity of the information 
collected; and (d) ways to minimize the burden of the collection of 
information on respondents, including through the use of automated 
collection techniques or other forms of information technology. 
Consideration will be given to comments and suggestions submitted by 
October 22, 2024.
    An agency may not conduct or sponsor, and a person is not required 
to respond to, a collection of information under the PRA unless it 
displays a currently valid OMB control number.
    Please direct your written comments to: Austin Gerig, Director/
Chief Data Officer, Securities and Exchange Commission, c/o Oluwaseun 
Ajayi, 100 F Street NE, Washington, DC 20549, or send an email to:

Secretary.
