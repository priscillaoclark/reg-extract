SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION: This form is used by an exporter (or broker 
acting on its behalf) in order to obtain approval for coverage of the 
repayment risk of export sales. The information received allows EXIM 
staff to make a determination of the eligibility of the applicant and 
the creditworthiness of one of the applicant's foreign buyers for EXIM 
assistance under its programs.
    The application tool can be reviewed at: <a href="https://img.exim.gov/s3fs-public/pub/pending/eib23-02.pdf">https://img.exim.gov/s3fs-public/pub/pending/eib23-02.pdf</a>.
    Title and Form Number: EIB 23-02, Application for Equity Express 
Select Insurance.
    OMB Number: 3048-XXXX.
    Type of Review: Regular.
    Need and Use:
    This is the application form for use by underserved U.S. businesses 
with limited export experience. Companies that are eligible to use the 
Equity Express Select policy will need to answer approximately 20 
questions and sign an acknowledgement of the certifications that appear 
on the reverse of the application form. This program does not provide 
discretionary credit authority to the U.S. exporter, and therefore the 
financial and credit information needs are minimized.
    Affected Public: This form affects entities involved in the export 
of U.S. goods and services.
    Annual Number of Respondents: 500.
    Estimated Time per Respondent: 0.25 hours.
    Annual Burden Hours: 125 hours.
    Frequency of Reporting of Use: Once per year.

    Dated: November 3, 2023.
