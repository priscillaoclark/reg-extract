Final Approval Under OMB Delegated Authority of the Extension for Three 
Years, With Revision, of the Following Information Collection

    Collection title: Recordkeeping and Disclosure Requirements 
Associated with Regulation O.
    Collection identifier: FR O.
    OMB control number: 7100-0382.
    Date: March 18, 2024.
    General description of collection: The Board's Regulation O--Loans 
to Executive Officers, Directors, and Principal Shareholders of Member 
Banks (12 CFR part 215) governs any extension of credit made by a 
member bank to an executive officer, director, or principal shareholder 
of the member bank, of any company of which the member bank is a 
subsidiary, and of any other subsidiary of that company. Regulation O 
prohibits extensions of credit to insiders unless they are made on 
substantially the same terms (including interest rates and collateral) 
as those prevailing at the time for comparable transactions by the bank 
with other persons who are not employed by the bank and do not involve 
more than the normal risk of repayment or present other unfavorable 
features. In addition, Regulation O limits extensions of credit by a 
member bank to individual insiders and to all insiders, requires a 
member bank's board of directors to approve certain large extensions of 
credit, and sets forth recordkeeping and disclosure requirements.
    Frequency: Event-generated.
    Respondents: Insured depository institutions and uninsured member 
banks.
    Total estimated number of respondents: 6,099.
    Total estimated change in burden: 12,512.
    Total estimated annual burden hours: 21,932.\1\
---------------------------------------------------------------------------

    \1\ More detailed information regarding this collection, 
including more detailed burden estimates, can be found in the OMB 
Supporting Statement posted at <a href="https://www.federalreserve.gov/apps/reportingforms/home/review">https://www.federalreserve.gov/apps/reportingforms/home/review</a>. On the page displayed at the link, you 
can find the OMB Supporting Statement by referencing the collection 
identifier, FR O.
---------------------------------------------------------------------------

    Current actions: On September 28, 2023, the Board published a 
notice in the Federal Register (88 FR 66843) requesting public comment 
for 60 days on the extension, with revision, of the FR O. The FR O PRA 
clearance currently only lists member banks as respondents. The Board 
proposed to revise the FR O PRA clearance to reflect that the 
information collections included in Regulation O, by operation of 
statute, apply in practice to all insured depository institutions, 
regardless of whether they are member banks. This revision would be 
solely an administrative law matter, and would not actually impose new 
requirements on any institutions. While the proposed revision would not 
substantively increase burden for any institution, the administrative 
change would result in a larger reported burden of 21,932 hours. The 
comment period for this notice expired on November 27, 2023. The Board 
did not receive any comments. The revisions will be implemented as 
proposed.

    Board of Governors of the Federal Reserve System, February 12, 
2024.
Michele Taylor Fennell,
Deputy Associate Secretary of the Board.
