operations.

II. Self-Regulatory Organization's Statement of the Purpose of, and 
Statutory Basis for, the Proposed Rule Change

    In its filing with the Commission, the Exchange included statements 
concerning the purpose of and basis for the proposed rule change and 
discussed any comments it received on the proposed rule change. The 
text of these statements may be examined at the places specified in 
Item IV below. The Exchange has prepared summaries, set forth in 
Sections A, B, and C below, of the most significant parts of such 
statements.

A. Self-Regulatory Organization's Statement of the Purpose of, and the 
Statutory Basis for, the Proposed Rule Change

1. Purpose
    The Exchange proposes to amend Rule 11.13, which describes its 
order routing processes, to modify the description of certain routing 
strategies that the Exchange proposes to offer when it commences 
operations.
    Recently, the Exchange proposed addition of reference in its Rules 
to various routing strategies that will be available through BYX based 
on the rules of its affiliate, BATS Exchange, Inc. (``BATS Exchange''). 
Such strategies include the CYCLE routing strategy, variations of the 
Parallel routing strategy, DRT routing and Destination Specific 
Routing. The Exchange proposes to further amend Rule 11.13 to offer two 
new routing strategies, which are described below.
    <bullet> TRIM. TRIM is a routing option under which an order will 
check the System for available shares and then will be sent to 
destinations on the System routing table.
    <bullet> SLIM. SLIM is a routing option under which an order will 
check the System for available shares and then will be sent to 
destinations on the System routing table, including BATS Exchange.
    In addition to the addition of the TRIM and SLIM routing 
strategies, the Exchange proposes modifying the description of the 
Parallel T routing strategy to make clear that when checking the 
Exchange's System for available shares, it will only check for 
displayed shares prior to routing away from the Exchange. The Parallel 
T routing strategy is intended to route only to Protected Quotations 
and only for displayed size, and thus, the Exchange believes that 
removal of only displayed size from its own System is most consistent 
with this strategy.
    Exchange Rule 11.13(a)(3)(E) includes a definition of DRT routing, 
which is a routing option in which the entering firm instructs the 
System to route to alternative trading systems included in the System 
routing table. The definition of DRT currently states that it can be 
combined with three specified routing strategies offered by the 
Exchange. The Exchange proposes modifying the description of DRT 
routing to make clear that it can be combined with all routing 
strategies, including the new TRIM and SLIM routing strategies, unless 
otherwise specified. In addition, because some routing strategies 
offered by the Exchange might include DRT routing at a later stage, the 
Exchange proposes to remove the word ``first'' from the definition of 
the DRT routing strategy.
2. Statutory Basis
    The rule change proposed in this submission is consistent with the 
requirements of the Act and the rules and regulations thereunder that 
are applicable to a national securities exchange, and, in particular, 
with the requirements of Section 6(b) of the Act.\4\ Specifically, the 
proposed change is consistent with Section 6(b)(5) of the Act,\5\ 
because it is designed to prevent fraudulent and manipulative acts and 
practices, to promote just and equitable principles of trade, to foster 
cooperation and coordination with persons engaged in facilitating 
transactions in securities, and to remove impediments to, and perfect 
the mechanism of, a free and open market and a national market system. 
The proposed change to introduce additional routing strategies will 
provide market participants with greater flexibility in routing orders 
consistent with Regulation NMS without developing complicated order 
routing strategies on their own.

B. Self-Regulatory Organization's Statement on Burden on Competition

    The Exchange does not believe that the proposed rule change imposes 
any burden on competition.

C. Self-Regulatory Organization's Statement on Comments on the Proposed 
Rule Change Received From Members, Participants, or Others

    The Exchange has neither solicited nor received written comments on 
the proposed rule change.

III. Date of Effectiveness of the Proposed Rule Change and Timing for 
Commission Action

    Because the foregoing proposed rule change does not: (i) 
Significantly affect the protection of investors or the public 
interest; (ii) impose any significant burden on competition; and (iii) 
become operative for 30 days from the date on which it was filed, or 
such shorter time as the Commission may designate, it has become 
effective pursuant to Section 19(b)(3)(A) of the Act \6\ and Rule 19b-
4(f)(6) thereunder.\7\
---------------------------------------------------------------------------

    \6\ 15 U.S.C. 78s(b)(3)(A).
    \7\ 17 CFR 240.19b-4(f)(6). In addition, Rule 19b-4(f)(6) 
requires a self-regulatory organization to give the Commission 
written notice of its intent to file the proposed rule change at 
least five business days prior to the date of filing of the proposed 
rule change, or such shorter time as designated by the Commission. 
BYX has satisfied this requirement.
---------------------------------------------------------------------------

    A proposed rule change filed pursuant to Rule 19b-4(f)(6) under the 
Act \8\ normally does not become operative for 30 days after the date 
of its filing. However, Rule 19b-4(f)(6) \9\ permits the Commission to 
designate a shorter time if such action is consistent with the 
protection of investors and the public interest. The Exchange requests 
that the Commission waive the 30-day operative delay in order to allow 
the Exchange to immediately offer Exchange Users the routing strategies 
when BYX, commences operations. Further, the Exchange believes that the 
proposed TRIM and SLIM routing strategies are consistent with routing 
strategies offered by the Nasdaq Stock Market (``NASDAQ'').\10\ In 
addition, the Exchange believes that its proposed new routing 
strategies will benefit market participants and their customers by 
allowing them greater flexibility in their efforts to fill orders and 
minimize trading costs. The Exchange expects to have technological 
changes for one or more of the new routing strategies in place to 
support the proposed rule change in the near future, and believes that 
benefits to Exchange Users expected from the proposed rule change 
should not be delayed. In addition, BYX states a delay to the 
implementation date would put the Exchange at a competitive 
disadvantage to other markets that already offer similar 
functionalities. The Commission believes that waiving the 30-day 
operative delay \11\ is consistent with the protection of investors and 
the public interest and designates the proposal operative upon filing.
---------------------------------------------------------------------------

    \8\ 17 CFR 240.19b-4(f)(6).
    \9\ Id.
    \10\ See NASDAQ Rule 4758.
    \11\ For purposes only of waiving the 30-day operative delay, 
the Commission has considered the proposed rule's impact on 
efficiency, competition, and capital formation. See 15 U.S.C. 
78c(f).
---------------------------------------------------------------------------

    At any time within 60 days of the filing of the proposed rule 
change, the Commission summarily may temporarily suspend such rule 
change if it appears to the Commission that such action is necessary or 
appropriate in the public interest, for the protection of investors, or 
otherwise in furtherance of the purposes of the Act.
