SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION: The Board created the Community Advisory 
Council (CAC) as an advisory committee to the Board on issues affecting 
consumers and communities. The CAC is composed of a diverse group of 
experts and representatives of consumer and community development 
organizations and interests, including from such fields as affordable 
housing, community and economic development, employment and labor, 
financial services and technology, small business, and asset and wealth 
building. CAC members meet semiannually with the members of the Board 
in Washington, DC to provide a range of perspectives on the economic 
circumstances and financial services needs of consumers and 
communities, with a particular focus on the concerns of low- and 
moderate-income consumers and communities. The CAC complements two of 
the Board's other advisory councils--the Community Depository 
Institutions Advisory Council (CDIAC) and the Federal Advisory Council 
(FAC)--whose members represent depository institutions.
    The CAC serves as a mechanism to gather feedback and perspectives 
on a wide range of policy matters and emerging issues of interest to 
the Board of Governors and aligns with the Federal Reserve's mission 
and current responsibilities. These responsibilities include, but are 
not limited to, banking supervision and regulatory compliance 
(including the enforcement of consumer protection laws), systemic risk 
oversight and monetary policy decision-making, and, in conjunction with 
the Office of the Comptroller of the Currency (OCC) and Federal Deposit 
Insurance Corporation (FDIC), responsibility for implementation of the 
Community Reinvestment Act (CRA).
    This Notice advises individuals of the opportunity to be considered 
for appointment to the CAC. To assist with the selection of CAC 
members, the Board will consider the information submitted by the 
candidate along with other publicly available information that it 
independently obtains.

Council Size and Terms

    The CAC consists of at least 15 members. The Board will select 
members in the fall of 2024 to replace current members whose terms will 
expire on December 31, 2024. The newly appointed members will serve 
three-year terms that will begin on January 1, 2025. If a member 
vacates the CAC before the end of the three-year term, a replacement 
member will be appointed to fill the unexpired term.

and wealth building, with a particular focus on the concerns of low- 
and moderate-income consumers and communities. Candidates do not have 
to be experts on all topics related to consumer financial services or 
community development, but they should possess some basic knowledge of 
these areas and related issues. In appointing members to the CAC, the 
Board will consider a number of factors, including diversity in terms 
of subject matter expertise, geographic representation, and the 
representation of women and minority groups.
    CAC members must be willing and able to make the necessary time 
commitment to participate in organizational conference calls and 
prepare for and attend meetings two times per year (usually for two 
days). The meetings will be held at the Board's offices in Washington, 
DC. The Board will provide a nominal honorarium and will reimburse CAC 
members only for their actual travel expenses subject to Board policy.
    By order of the Board of Governors of the Federal Reserve System, 
acting through the Director of the Division of Consumer and Community 
Affairs under delegated authority, March 25, 2024.

Ann E. Misback,
Secretary of the Board.
