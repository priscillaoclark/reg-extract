7 CFR Part 1470

[Docket No. NRCS-2019-0020]
RIN 0578-AA67


Conservation Stewardship Program (CSP); Corrections

AGENCY: Commodity Credit Corporation, United States Department of 
Agriculture.

ACTION: Correcting amendments.

-----------------------------------------------------------------------

SUMMARY: The Commodity Credit Corporation (CCC) revised the 
Conservation Stewardship Program (CSP) regulation in the final rule 
published in the Federal Register on October 9, 2020, in response to 
public comments. Changes were published in the final rule that revised 
the definition for resource-conserving crop. As part of a recent 
review, a technical error in the definition of ``resource-conserving 
crop'' was discovered. This document corrects the error. In addition, 
there was an inadvertent error and the definition for ``resource-
conserving crop rotation'' needs to be reinstated; the definition 
remains unchanged from the interim rule as published in the Federal 
Register on November 12, 2019.

DATES: Effective: August 3, 2021.

FOR FURTHER INFORMATION CONTACT: Michael Whitt. Phone: (202) 690-2267 
or email: <a href="mailto:michael.whitt@usda.gov">michael.whitt@usda.gov</a>. Persons with disabilities who require 
alternative means for communication should contact the USDA Target 
Center at (202) 720-2600 (voice).

SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION: CCC revised the definition for ``resource-
conserving crop'' in 7 CFR 1470.3 in the final rule published in the 
Federal Register on October 9, 2020 (85 FR 63993-64003). As part of a 
recent review, a technical error in the definition of ``resource-
conserving crop'' was discovered. This document corrects the error.
    CCC previously revised the definition for ``resource-conserving 
crop rotation'' in 7 CFR 1470.3 in the interim rule published in the 
Federal Register on November 12, 2019 (84 FR 60883-60900). It appears 
that when the definition for ``resource-conserving crop'' was revised 
in October that the definition for ``resource-conserving crop 
rotation'' was inadvertently removed. This document reinstates the 
definition for ``resource-conserving crop rotation'' as it appeared in 
the November 2019 interim rule.
