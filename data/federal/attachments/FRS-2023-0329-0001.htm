Years, With Revision, of the Following Information Collection

    Collection title: Single-Counterparty Credit Limits.
    Collection identifier: FR 2590.
    OMB control number: 7100-0377.
    Effective Date: June 30, 2024.
    General description of collection: The FR 2590 was implemented in 
connection with the Board's single-counterparty credit limits rule 
(SCCL rule),\1\ codified in the Board's Regulation YY--Enhanced 
Prudential Standards (12 CFR part 252) \2\ and the Board's Regulation 
LL--Savings and Loan Holding Companies (12 CFR part 238).\3\
---------------------------------------------------------------------------

    \1\ 83 FR 38460 (August 6, 2018). See also 84 FR 59032 (November 
1, 2019) (finalizing the SCCL rule for Savings and Loan Holding 
Companies).
    \2\ See 12 CFR part 252, subparts H and Q.
    \3\ See 12 CFR part 238, subpart Q.
---------------------------------------------------------------------------

    The information collected by the FR 2590 reporting form allows the 
Board to monitor a covered company's or a covered foreign entity's 
compliance with the SCCL rule. In addition to the reporting form, the 
FR 2590 information collection incorporates notice requirements 
pertaining to requests that may be made by a covered company or covered 
foreign entity to request temporary relief from specific requirements 
of the SCCL rule, as well as a requirement that filers of the FR 2590 
reporting form retain an exact copy of each completed FR 2590.
    Frequency: Quarterly, event-generated.
    Respondents: Covered company or covered foreign entity. A covered 
company is any U.S. bank holding company that is subject to Category I, 
II, or III standards or any savings and loan holding company that is 
subject to Category II or III standards. A covered foreign entity is a 
foreign banking organization (FBO) that is subject to Category II or 
III standards or that has total global consolidated assets of $250 
billion or more, and any U.S. intermediate holding company that is 
subject to Category II or III standards.
    Total estimated number of respondents: 83.
    Estimated average hours per response:
    Reporting FR 2590 Form: 170.56.
    Reporting Requests for temporary relief: 10.
    Recordkeeping: 0.25.
    Total estimated change in burden: 0.
    Total estimated annual burden hours: 56,719.\4\
---------------------------------------------------------------------------

    \4\ More detailed information regarding this collection, 
including more detailed burden estimates, can be found in the OMB 
Supporting Statement posted at <a href="https://www.federalreserve.gov/apps/reportingforms/home/review">https://www.federalreserve.gov/apps/reportingforms/home/review</a>. On the page displayed at the link, you 
can find the OMB Supporting Statement by referencing the collection 
identifier, FR 2590.
---------------------------------------------------------------------------

    Current actions: On September 11, 2023, the Board published a 
notice in the Federal Register (88 FR 62364) requesting public comment 
for 60 days on the extension, with revision, of the FR 2590. The Board 
proposed to revise the FR 2590 reporting form to clarify that an FBO 
that meets the large exposure standards on a consolidated basis 
established by its home-country supervisor is not required to provide 
additional documentation as part of its FR 2590 submission. The Board 
also proposed to clarify that a respondent should use tier 1 capital 
data and total consolidated assets data that is concurrent with its FR 
2590 submission when calculating and reporting compliance with the SCCL 
rule. The Board also proposed to clarify that respondents should retain 
manually signed and attested copies of the cover page of the FR 2590 
form and of the data submitted for three years, in accordance with 
similar requirements for other regulatory reports. The Board also 
proposed to clarify that the order of counterparties should be the same 
across Schedules G-1 through G-4, Schedules M-1 through M-2, and the 
Summary of Net Credit Exposures. Finally, the Board proposed to revise 
Schedule M-1 by adding an additional table for firms calculating 
derivative transaction exposures using the standardized approach for 
counterparty credit risk to report collateral received in connection 
with those derivative transactions. The comment period for this notice 
expired on November 13, 2023. The Board did not receive any comments 
relevant to the revision of this collection or to the PRA. The 
revisions will be implemented as proposed.

    Board of Governors of the Federal Reserve System, December 22, 
2023.
Michele Taylor Fennell,
Deputy Associate Secretary of the Board.
