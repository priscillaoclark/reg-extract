Final Approval Under OMB Delegated Authority of the Extension for Three 
Years, Without Revision, of the Following Information Collection

    Collection title: Reporting, Recordkeeping, and Disclosure 
Requirements Associated with the CFPB's Home Mortgage Disclosure Act 
Loan/Application Register Required by Regulation C.
    Collection identifier: FR HMDA LAR.
    OMB control number: 7100-0247.
    General description of collection: The HMDA was enacted in 1975 and 
is implemented by Regulation C. Generally, the HMDA requires certain 
depository and non-depository institutions that make certain mortgage 
loans to collect, report, and disclose data about originations and 
purchases of mortgage loans, as well as loan applications that do not 
result in originations (for example, applications that are denied or 
withdrawn).
    The FR HMDA LAR is the Board's information collection associated 
with the CFPB's Regulation C. The FR HMDA LAR is used to (1) help 
determine whether financial institutions are serving the housing needs 
of their communities, (2) assist public officials in distributing 
public-sector investments so as to attract private investment to areas 
where it is needed, and (3) assist in identifying possible 
discriminatory lending patterns and enforcing anti-discrimination 
statutes.
    Frequency: Quarterly and annually.
    Respondents: Except those that are supervised by the CFPB: state 
member banks, their subsidiaries, subsidiaries of bank holding 
companies, subsidiaries of savings and loan holding companies, U.S. 
branches and agencies of foreign banks (other than federal branches, 
federal agencies, and insured state branches of foreign banks), 
commercial lending companies owned or controlled by foreign banks, and 
organizations operating under section 25 or 25A of the Federal Reserve 
Act (12 U.S.C. 601-604a; 611-631).
    Total estimated number of respondents: 654.
    Total estimated annual burden hours: 960,235.
    Current actions: On June 7, 2024, the Board published a notice in 
the Federal Register (89 FR 48636) requesting public comment for 60 
days on the extension, without revision, of the FR HMDA LAR. The 
comment period for this notice expired on August 6, 2024. The Board did 
not receive any comments.

    Board of Governors of the Federal Reserve System, October 23, 
2024.
Benjamin W. McDonough,
Deputy Secretary and Ombuds of the Board.
