determining whether to approve a collection of information, the Board 
will consider all comments received from the public and other agencies.
    During the comment period for this proposal, a copy of the proposed 
PRA OMB submission, including the draft reporting form and 
instructions, supporting statement (which contains more detail about 
the information collection and burden estimates than this notice), and 
other documentation, will be made available on the Board's public 
website at <a href="https://www.federalreserve.gov/apps/reportingforms/home/review">https://www.federalreserve.gov/apps/reportingforms/home/review</a> or may be requested from the agency clearance officer, whose 
name appears above. On the page displayed at the link above, you can 
find the supporting information by referencing the collection 
identifier, FR 2510. Final versions of these documents will be made 
available at <a href="https://www.reginfo.gov/public/do/PRAMain">https://www.reginfo.gov/public/do/PRAMain</a>, if approved.

Request for Comment on Information Collection Proposal

    The Board invites public comment on the following information 
collection, which is being reviewed under authority delegated by the 
OMB under the PRA. Comments are invited on the following:
    a. Whether the proposed collection of information is necessary for 
the proper performance of the Board's functions, including whether the 
information has practical utility;
    b. The accuracy of the Board's estimate of the burden of the 
proposed information collection, including the validity of the 
methodology and assumptions used;
    c. Ways to enhance the quality, utility, and clarity of the 
information to be collected;
    d. Ways to minimize the burden of information collection on 
respondents, including through the use of automated collection 
techniques or other forms of information technology; and
    e. Estimates of capital or startup costs and costs of operation, 
maintenance, and purchase of services to provide information.
    At the end of the comment period, the comments and recommendations 
received will be analyzed to determine the extent to which the Board 
should modify the proposal.

Proposal Under OMB Delegated Authority To Extend for Three Years, 
Without Revision, the Following Information Collection

    Collection title: Report of Institution-to-Aggregate Granular Data 
on Assets and Liabilities on an Immediate Counterparty Basis.
    Collection identifier: FR 2510.
    OMB control number: 7100-0376.
    General description of collection: The FR 2510 collects granular 
exposure data on the assets, liabilities, and off-balance sheet 
holdings of certain large banking organizations, providing breakdowns 
by country, instrument, currency, maturity, sector, and other factors. 
The FR 2510 also collects country exposure data on an immediate 
counterparty basis and detailed information on firms' derivatives 
exposures. The information collected by the FR 2510 supports the 
Board's supervision of global systemically important bank holding 
companies (BHCs) by allowing for a more complete balance sheet analysis 
of these firms and allows the Board to more closely monitor the 
systemic impacts of such firms' activities and investments.
    The Board makes available on its public website the instructions 
for the FR 2510, Report of Institution-to-Aggregate Granular Data on 
Assets and Liabilities on an Immediate Counterparty Basis, which are 
currently in a two-column format. To improve readability on electronic 
devices, the Board is considering updating the instructions to a one-
column format.
    Frequency: Quarterly.
    Respondents: Any BHC that is organized under the laws of the United 
States or any U.S. state and that is identified as a global 
systemically important BHC under the Board's Regulation Q.
    Total estimated number of respondents: 8.
    Total estimated annual burden hours: 18,528.

    Board of Governors of the Federal Reserve System, December 2, 
2024.
Benjamin W. McDonough,
Deputy Secretary and Ombuds of the Board.
