---------------------------------------------------------------------------

II. Summary of the Proposed Rule Change

A. Background

    The Clearing Agency Risk Management Framework (``Framework'') 
provides an outline for, among other things, how each of the Clearing 
Agencies comprehensively manages the risks, including the legal, 
credit, liquidity, operational, general business, investment, custody, 
and other risks, that arise in or are borne by it.
    On December 13, 2023, the Commission adopted rules under the Act to 
amend the standards applicable to covered clearing agencies providing 
central counterparty services for transactions in U.S. Treasury 
securities to require policies and procedures be reasonably designed to 
ensure that the covered clearing agency has appropriate means to 
facilitate access to clearance and settlement services of all eligible 
secondary market transactions in U.S. Treasury securities, including 
those of indirect participants.\8\ The adopted rules also require that 
these policies and procedures be reviewed annually by the board of 
directors of such covered clearing agencies for U.S. Treasury 
securities.\9\ Currently, FICC is the only Clearing Agency providing 
clearance and settlement services to the U.S. Treasury securities 
market.
---------------------------------------------------------------------------

    \8\ See Securities Exchange Act Release No. 99149 (Dec. 13, 
2023), 89 FR 2714 (Jan. 16, 2024) (S7-23-22) (Standards for Covered 
Clearing Agencies for U.S. Treasury Securities and Application of 
the Broker-Dealer Customer Protection Rule with Respect to U.S. 
Treasury Securities).
    \9\ 17 CFR 240.17Ad-22(e)(18)(iv)(C).
---------------------------------------------------------------------------

B. Proposed Rule Changes

    The Proposed Rule Changes would amend the Framework to: (i) 
describe generally Clearing Agency participant and industry stakeholder 
outreach in the development and evaluation of new programs or risk 
management practices; (ii) provide for the annual review of FICC's 
Government Securities Division (``GSD'') access models by FICC's Board 
of Directors; and (iii) make other conforming and clean up changes to 
the text of the Framework. Other than those described in (iii), these 
changes would be set forth in a new section 3.4 ``Solicitation of 
Participant and Stakeholder Views,'' consisting of two subsections 
described below.
    First, new subsection 3.4.1 (General Solicitation of Views) would 
codify an existing practice, that is, that the Clearing Agencies 
routinely solicit their participants' and other industry stakeholders' 
views when developing and evaluating products, services, or risk 
management practices so they may best meet the industry's needs.\10\ 
This new subsection would describe several ways that the Clearing 
Agencies may seek the views of participants and stakeholders, 
including, but not limited to, targeted outreach to firms expected to 
be impacted by a proposal, widely distributed surveys, ad hoc forums, 
and standing and temporary advisory councils assembled to consider 
issues relevant to a proposal. The subsection would also identify the 
stakeholders that may participate in such advisory councils, including 
for example, representatives from transfer agents, liquidity providers, 
market infrastructures, institutional and retail investors, customers 
of the Clearing Agencies' participants, securities issuers, and 
securities holders. The Clearing Agencies state that the proposed 
changes in sub-section 3.4.1 do not create any particular obligation 
for the Clearing Agencies to conduct such outreach in any 
circumstance.\11\
---------------------------------------------------------------------------

    \10\ See DTC Notice of Filing, supra note 3, 89 FR at 21119; 
FICC Notice of Filing, supra note 3, 89 FR at 21069; NSCC Notice of 
Filing, supra note 3, 89 FR at 21092.
    \11\ Id.
---------------------------------------------------------------------------

    Second, the Clearing Agencies proposed new sub-section 3.4.2 
(Required Solicitation of Views--Annual Review of GSD Access Models) in 
connection with the recently adopted requirement, noted above, that the 
Board of Directors of all covered clearing agencies serving the U.S. 
Treasury securities market conduct an annual review of their policies 
and

[[Page 53675]]

procedures to ensure that they have appropriate means to facilitate 
access to clearance and settlement services of all eligible secondary 
market transactions in U.S. Treasury securities, including those of 
indirect participants. To address the new requirement, the new 
subsection would provide that FICC would establish an advisory council 
which would assist in the annual review of GSD's access models. The 
advisory council will be comprised of participants, their customers, 
and other industry stakeholders. This annual advisory council review of 
GSD's access models would precede an annual review of GSD's access 
models by the FICC Board, which would also be required by this new 
subsection.\12\ The new subsection would require that the annual review 
include the following: (1) document any instance in which FICC treats 
transactions differently and confirm that any variation in treatment is 
both necessary and appropriate; (2) consider whether to enable GSD's 
Netting Members to submit eligible transactions for clearance and 
settlement that have been executed by two indirect participants of 
FICC/GSD (``done-away''); (3) consider the volumes and proportion of 
the markets that are being centrally cleared through different access 
models; and (4) consider whether it is appropriate to develop and 
propose an additional category or categories of Netting Members to the 
GSD Rules to reflect the types of legal entities that applied to be a 
Netting Member over the prior 12 months and did not fit into one of the 
existing Netting Member categories.
---------------------------------------------------------------------------

    \12\ 17 CFR 240.17Ad-22(e)(18)(iv)(C).
---------------------------------------------------------------------------

i. Other Conforming and Clean Up Changes
    Third, the Proposed Rule Changes would make other conforming, non-
substantive changes to the release to reflect the inclusion of the new 
subsections described above and to remove the defined term ``Management 
Committee'' wherever referenced and replace it with ``senior management 
committee'' while maintaining the current makeup and responsibilities 
of the current Management Committee, as described in the Framework. The 
Clearing Agencies state that the Proposed Rule Changes would allow the 
Framework to continue to be accurate notwithstanding any future name 
changes to the committee.\13\ Other minor grammatical and clean up 
changes would also be made to the Framework.
---------------------------------------------------------------------------

    \13\ See DTC Notice of Filing, supra note 3, 89 FR at 21120; 
FICC Notice of Filing, supra note 3, 89 FR at 21070; NSCC Notice of 
Filing, supra note 3, 89 FR at 21093.
---------------------------------------------------------------------------

III. Proceedings To Determine Whether To Approve or Disapprove the 
Proposed Rule Change and Grounds for Dispproval Under Consideration

    The Commission is instituting proceedings pursuant to Section 
19(b)(2)(B) of the Exchange Act to determine whether the Proposed Rule 
Changes should be approved or disapproved.\14\ Institution of 
proceedings is appropriate at this time in view of the legal and policy 
issues raised by the Proposed Rule Changes. Institution of proceedings 
does not indicate that the Commission has reached any conclusions with 
respect to any of the issues involved. Rather, the Commission seeks and 
encourages interested persons to comment on the Proposed Rule Changes, 
which would provide the Commission with arguments to support the 
Commission's analysis as to whether to approve or disapprove the 
Proposed Rule Changes.
---------------------------------------------------------------------------

    \14\ 15 U.S.C. 78s(b)(2)(B).
---------------------------------------------------------------------------

    Pursuant to Section 19(b)(2)(B) of the Exchange Act,\15\ the 
Commission is providing notice of the grounds for disapproval under 
consideration. The Commission is instituting proceedings to allow for 
additional analysis of, and input from commenters with respect to, the 
Proposed Rule Changes' consistency with Section 17A of the Exchange Act 
\16\ and the rules thereunder, including the following provisions:

in Section 17A of the Exchange Act (15 U.S.C. 78q-1) applicable to 
clearing agencies, and the objectives of owners and participants; (iv) 
establish that the board of directors and senior management have

clearing agency, which includes risk management policies, procedures, 
and systems designed to identify, measure, monitor, and manage the 
range of risks that arise in or are borne by the covered clearing 
agency, that are subject to review on a specified periodic basis and 
approved by the board of directors annually;

    \19\ 17 CFR 240.17ad-22(e)(3)(i).

transactions in U.S. Treasury securities, including those of indirect 
participants, which policies the U.S. Treasury securities covered 
clearing agency board of directors reviews annually; and,

recurring basis.

IV. Procedure: Request for Written Comments

    The Commission requests that interested persons provide written 
submissions of their views, data, and arguments with respect to the 
issues identified above, as well as any other concerns they may have 
with the Proposed Rule Changes. In particular, the Commission invites 
the written views of interested persons concerning whether the Proposed 
Rule Changes are consistent with Section 17A(b)(3)(F) \22\ and Rules 
17ad-22(e)(2), 17ad-22(e)(3)(i), 17ad-22(e)(18)(iv)(C), and 17ad-25(j) 
\23\ of the Exchange Act, or any other provision of the Exchange Act, 
or the rules and regulations thereunder. Although there do not appear 
to be any issues relevant to approval or disapproval that would be 
facilitated by an oral presentation of views, data, and arguments, the 
Commission will consider, pursuant to Rule 19b-4(g) under the Exchange 
Act,\24\ any request for an opportunity to make an oral 
presentation.\25\

Commission flexibility to determine what type of proceeding--either 
oral or notice and opportunity for written comments--is appropriate 
for consideration of a particular proposal by a self-regulatory 
organization. See Securities Act Amendments of 1975, Senate Comm. on 
Banking, Housing & Urban Affairs, S. Rep. No. 75, 94th Cong., 1st
