AGENCY: Commodity Futures Trading Commission.

ACTION: Notice of renewal.

-----------------------------------------------------------------------

SUMMARY: The Commodity Futures Trading Commission (CFTC or Commission) 
is publishing this notice to announce the renewal of the Technology 
Advisory Committee (TAC). The Commission has determined that the 
renewal of the TAC is necessary and in the public's interest, and the 
CFTC has consulted with the General Services Administration's Committee 
Management Secretariat regarding the TAC's renewal.

FOR FURTHER INFORMATION CONTACT: Anthony Biagioli, Trial Attorney and 
TAC Designated Federal Officer, at 816-960-7722 or <a href="/cdn-cgi/l/email-protection#c584a7aca4a2acaaa9ac85a6a3b1a6eba2aab3"><span class="__cf_email__" data-cfemail="8ccdeee5edebe5e3e0e5ccefeaf8efa2ebe3fa">[email&#160;protected]</span></a>.

SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION: The CFTC's advisory committees were created 
to provide input and make recommendations to the Commission on a 
variety of regulatory and market issues that affect the integrity and 
competitiveness of U.S. financial services and markets. The committees 
facilitate communication between the Commission and U.S. derivatives 
markets, trading firms, market participants, and end users. The TAC is 
one of five CFTC advisory committees. The TAC's objectives and scope of 
activities shall be to provide advice and recommendations to the 
Commission. The TAC will assist the Commission with advice and 
recommendations on the impact and implications of technological 
innovation in the financial services and markets. The TAC will provide 
advice on the application and utilization of new technologies in 
financial services, derivatives, and commodity markets, as well as by 
market professionals and market users. The TAC may further provide 
advice to the Commission on the appropriate level of investment in 
technology at the Commission to meet its surveillance and enforcement 
responsibilities, and inform the Commission's consideration of 
technology-related issues to support the Commission's mission of 
ensuring the integrity of the markets and achievement of other public 
interest objectives.
    The TAC will operate for two years from the date of renewal unless 
the Commission directs that the TAC terminate on an earlier date. A 
copy of the TAC renewal charter has been filed with the Commission; the 
Senate Committee on Agriculture, Nutrition and Forestry; the House 
Committee on Agriculture; the Library of Congress; and the General 
Services Administration's Committee Management Secretariat. A copy of 
the renewal charter will be posted on the CFTC's website at 
<a href="http://www.cftc.gov">www.cftc.gov</a>.

    Dated: August 30, 2024.
Christopher Kirkpatrick,
Secretary of the Commission.
