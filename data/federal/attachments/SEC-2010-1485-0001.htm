SECURITIES AND EXCHANGE COMMISSION

 
Submission for OMB Review; Comment Request

Upon Written Request, Copies Available From: Securities and Exchange 
Commission, Office of Investor Education and Advocacy, Washington, DC 
20549-0213.

Extension:
    Rule 203-3, Form ADV-H; SEC File No. 270-481; OMB Control No. 
3235-0538.

    Notice is hereby given that, pursuant to the Paperwork Reduction 
Act of 1995 (44 U.S.C. 3501 et seq.), the Securities and Exchange 
Commission (``Commission'') has submitted to the Office of Management 
and Budget (``OMB'') a request for extension of the previously approved 
collection of information discussed below.
    The title for the collection of information is ``Rule 203-3 and 
Form ADV-H under the Investment Advisers Act of 1940.'' Rule 203-3 (17 
CFR 275.203-3) under the Investment Advisers Act of 1940 (15 U.S.C. 
80b) establishes procedures for an investment adviser to obtain a 
hardship exemption from the electronic filing requirements of the 
Investment Advisers Act. Rule 203-3 requires every person requesting a 
hardship exemption to file Form ADV-H (17 CFR 279.3) with the 
Commission. The purpose of this collection of information is to permit 
advisers to obtain a hardship exemption, on a continuing or temporary 
basis, to not complete an electronic filing. The temporary hardship 
exemption permits advisers to make late filings due to unforeseen 
computer or software problems, while the continuing hardship exemption 
permits advisers to submit all required electronic filings on hard copy 
for data entry by the operator of the IARD.
    The respondents to the collection of information are all investment 
advisers that are registered with the Commission. The Commission has 
estimated that compliance with the requirement to complete Form ADV-H 
imposes a total burden of approximately 1 hour for an adviser. Based on 
our experience with hardship filings, we estimate that we will receive 
11 Form ADV-H filings annually. Based on the 60 minute per respondent 
estimate, the Commission estimates a total annual burden of 11 hours 
for this collection of information.
    Rule 203-3 and Form ADV-H do not require recordkeeping or records 
retention. The collection of information requirements under the rule 
and form are mandatory. The information collected pursuant to the rule 
and Form ADV-H consists of filings with the Commission. These filings 
are not kept confidential. An agency may not conduct or sponsor, and a 
person is not required to respond to, a collection of information 
unless it displays a currently valid control number.
