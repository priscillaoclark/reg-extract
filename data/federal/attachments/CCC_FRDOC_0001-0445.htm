Domestic Sugar Program--2023-Crop Sugar Marketing Allotments and 
Cane and Beet Processor Allocations

AGENCY: Commodity Credit Corporation, U.S. Department of Agriculture.

ACTION: Notice.

-----------------------------------------------------------------------

SUMMARY: The United States Department of Agriculture (USDA) is issuing 
this notice to revise fiscal year (FY) 2024 (crop year 2023) State cane 
sugar allotments and allocations to sugarcane processors as well as 
company allocations to sugar beet processors. These actions apply to 
all domestic beet and cane sugar marketed for human

consumption in the United States from October 1, 2023, through 
September 30, 2024.

FOR FURTHER INFORMATION CONTACT: Jacob Vuillemin, telephone, (202) 302-
3922; or email, <a href="/cdn-cgi/l/email-protection#513b30323e337f2724383d3d343c383f11242235307f363e27"><span class="__cf_email__" data-cfemail="2e444f4d414c00585b4742424b4347406e5b5d4a4f00494158">[email&#160;protected]</span></a>.

SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION: On October 13, 2023, USDA announced the 
initial fiscal year 2024 (FY24) Overall Allotment Quantity (OAQ), which 
was established at 10,667,500 short tons, raw value (STRV), equal to 85 
percent of the estimated quantity of sugar for domestic human 
consumption for the fiscal year of 12,550,000 STRV as forecast in the 
September 2023 World Agricultural Supply and Demand Estimates report 
(WASDE). The Agricultural Adjustment Act of 1938, as amended, requires 
that 54.35 percent of the OAQ be distributed among beet processors and 
45.65 percent be distributed among the sugarcane States and cane 
processors. The beet sector allotment is 5,797,786 STRV and the cane 
sector allotment is 4,868,714 STRV. The beet and cane sector allotments 
are distributed to individual processors according to statutory 
formulas, as shown in the table below.
    In accordance with section 359e of Agricultural Adjustment Act of 
1938, as amended (7 U.S.C. 1359ee), after evaluating each sugar beet 
processor's ability to market its full allocation, USDA is transferring 
FY24 allocations from sugar beet processors with surplus allocation to 
those with deficit allocation as set out in the table below. USDA has 
also determined that domestic beet sugar supplies are inadequate to 
fill the FY24 beet sugar marketing allotment.
    In accordance with section 7 U.S.C. 1359ee, USDA is reassigning 
250,000 STRV of this deficit to raw cane sugar imports already 
anticipated, given the absence of any Commodity Credit Corporation 
(CCC) stocks of sugar. Each sugar beet processor's allocation following 
these changes is shown in the column labeled ``Revised FY24 
Allocations'' and the amount of the change in each processor's 
allocation is in the column labeled ``Reassignments.''
    In accordance with 7 U.S.C. 1359ee, after evaluating each sugarcane 
processor's ability to market its full allocation, USDA is transferring 
FY24 allocations from sugarcane processors with surplus allocation to 
those with deficit allocation as set out in the table below. USDA has 
also determined that domestic cane sugar supplies are inadequate to 
fill the FY24 cane sugar marketing allotment.
    In accordance with 7 U.S.C. 1359ee, USDA is reassigning 600,000 
STRV of this deficit to raw cane sugar imports already anticipated, 
given the absence of any CCC stocks of sugar. Each sugarcane 
processor's allocation following these changes is shown in the column 
labeled ``Revised FY24 Allocations'' and the amount of the change in 
each processor's allocation is in the column labeled ``Reassignments.''

    These FY24 sugar marketing allotment program actions will not 
prevent any domestic sugarcane or sugar beet processor from marketing 
all of its FY24 sugar supply. USDA will closely monitor stocks, 
consumption, imports and all sugar market and program variables on an 
ongoing basis and may make further program adjustments during FY 24 if 
needed.
