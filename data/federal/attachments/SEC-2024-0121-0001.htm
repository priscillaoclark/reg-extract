    Section 19(b)(2) of the Act \5\ provides that, within 45 days of 
the publication of notice of the filing of a proposed rule change, or 
within such longer period up to 90 days as the Commission may designate 
if it finds such longer period to be appropriate and publishes its 
reasons for so finding or as to which the self-regulatory organization 
consents, the Commission shall either approve the proposed rule change, 
disapprove the proposed rule change, or institute proceedings to 
determine whether the proposed rule change should be disapproved. The

    The Commission is extending the 45-day time period for Commission 
action on the proposed rule change. The Commission finds that it is 
appropriate to designate a longer period within which to take action on 
the proposed rule change so that it has sufficient time to consider the 
proposed rule change and the comments received. Accordingly, pursuant 
to Section 19(b)(2) of the Act,\6\ the Commission designates March 13, 
2024, as the date by which the Commission shall either approve or 
disapprove, or institute proceedings to determine whether to 
disapprove, the proposed rule change (File No. SR-CBOE-2023-063).
