Inflation Adjustment of Civil Monetary Penalties

AGENCY: Office of Foreign Assets Control, Treasury.

ACTION: Final rule.

-----------------------------------------------------------------------

SUMMARY: The Department of the Treasury's Office of Foreign Assets 
Control (OFAC) is issuing this final rule to adjust certain civil 
monetary penalties for inflation pursuant to the Federal Civil 
Penalties Inflation Adjustment Act of 1990, as amended by the Federal 
Civil Penalties Inflation Adjustment Act Improvements Act of 2015.

DATES: This rule is effective January 12, 2024.

FOR FURTHER INFORMATION CONTACT: OFAC: Assistant Director for 
Licensing, 202-622-2480; Assistant Director for Regulatory Affairs, 
202-622-4855; Assistant Director for Compliance, 202-622-2490.

SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION:

Electronic Availability

    This document and additional information concerning OFAC are 
available from OFAC's website (<a href="http://www.treas.gov/ofac">www.treas.gov/ofac</a>).

Background

    Section 4 of the Federal Civil Penalties Inflation Adjustment Act 
of 1990 (Pub. L. 101-410, 104 Stat. 890; 28 U.S.C. 2461 note), as 
amended by the Federal Civil Penalties Inflation Adjustment Act 
Improvements Act of 2015 (Pub. L. 114-74, 129 Stat. 599, 28 U.S.C. 2461 
note) (the FCPIA Act), requires each federal agency with statutory 
authority to assess civil monetary penalties (CMPs) to adjust CMPs 
annually for inflation according to a formula described in section 5 of 
the FCPIA Act. One purpose of the FCPIA Act is to ensure that CMPs 
continue to maintain their deterrent effect through periodic cost-of-
living-based adjustments.
    OFAC has adjusted its CMPs nine times since the Federal Civil 
Penalties Inflation Adjustment Act Improvements Act of 2015 went into 
effect on November 2, 2015: an initial catch-up adjustment on August 1, 
2016 (81 FR 43070, July 1, 2016); an additional initial catch-up 
adjustment related to CMPs for failure to comply with a requirement to 
furnish information, the late filing of a required report, and failure 
to maintain records (``recordkeeping CMPs'') that were inadvertently 
omitted from the August 1, 2016 initial catch-up adjustment on October 
5, 2020 (85 FR 54911, September 3, 2020); and annual adjustments on 
February 10, 2017 (82 FR 10434, February 10, 2017); March 19, 2018 (83 
FR 11876, March 19, 2018); June 14, 2019 (84 FR 27714, June 14, 2019); 
April 9, 2020 (85 FR 19884, April 9, 2020); March 17, 2021 (86 FR 
14534, March 17, 2021); February 9, 2022 (87 FR 7369, February 9, 
2022); and January 13, 2023 (88 FR 2229, January 13, 2023).

Method of Calculation

    The method of calculating CMP adjustments applied in this final 
rule is required by the FCPIA Act. Under the FCPIA Act and the Office 
of Management and Budget guidance required by the FCPIA Act, annual 
inflation adjustments subsequent to the initial catch-up adjustment are 
to be based on the percent change between the Consumer Price Index for 
all Urban Consumers (``CPI-U'') for the October preceding the date of 
the adjustment and the prior year's October CPI-U. As set forth in 
Office of Management and Budget Memorandum M-24-07 of December 19, 
2023, the adjustment multiplier for 2023 is 1.03241. In order to 
complete the 2024 annual adjustment, each current CMP is multiplied by 
the 2024 adjustment multiplier. Under the FCPIA Act, any increase in 
CMP must be rounded to the nearest multiple of $1.

New Penalty Amounts

    OFAC imposes CMPs pursuant to the penalty authority in five 
statutes: the Trading With the Enemy Act (50 U.S.C. 4301-4341, at 4315) 
(TWEA); the International Emergency Economic Powers Act (50 U.S.C. 
1701-1706, at 1705) (IEEPA); the Antiterrorism and Effective Death 
Penalty Act of 1996 (18 U.S.C. 2339B) (AEDPA); the Foreign Narcotics 
Kingpin Designation Act (21 U.S.C. 1901-1908, at 1906) (FNKDA); and the 
Clean Diamond Trade Act (19 U.S.C. 3901-3913, at 3907) (CDTA).
    The table below summarizes the existing and new maximum CMP amounts 
for each statute.

           Table 1--Maximum CMP Amounts for Relevant Statutes

CDTA........................               16,108                 16,630
------------------------------------------------------------------------

    In addition to updating these maximum CMP amounts, OFAC is also 
updating two references to one-half the IEEPA maximum CMP from $178,290 
to $184,068, and is adjusting the recordkeeping CMP amounts found in 
OFAC's Economic Sanctions Enforcement Guidelines in appendix A to 31 
CFR part 501. The table below summarizes the existing and new maximum 
CMP amounts for OFAC's recordkeeping CMPs.

 CFR 501.602 where OFAC has
 reason to believe that the

 involves a transaction(s)
 valued at greater than
 500,000, irrespective of
 whether any other violation

Late filing of a required                   3,439                  3,550

Failure to maintain records                68,928                 71,162

 regulations or of a
 specific license...........
------------------------------------------------------------------------

    Finally, OFAC is making changes in the authorities citations of 31 
CFR parts 583 and 594 to more specifically reference one of the 
relevant statutory authorities in each citation.

Public Participation

    The FCPIA Act expressly exempts this final rule from the notice and 
comment requirements of the Administrative Procedure Act by directing 
agencies to adjust CMPs for inflation ``notwithstanding section 553 of 
title 5, United States Code'' (Pub. L. 114-74, 129 Stat. 599; 28 U.S.C. 
2461 note). As such, this final rule is being issued without prior 
public notice or opportunity for public comment, with an effective date 
of January 12, 2024.

Regulatory Flexibility Act

    Because no notice of proposed rulemaking is required, the 
provisions of the Regulatory Flexibility Act (5 U.S.C. 601 et seq.) do 
not apply.

Executive Order 12866

    This rule is not a significant regulatory action as defined in 
section 3.f. of Executive Order 12866 of September 30, 1993, 
``Regulatory Planning and Review'' (58 FR 51735, October 4, 1993), as 
amended.

Paperwork Reduction Act

    The Paperwork Reduction Act does not apply because this rule does 
not impose information collection requirements that would require the 
approval of the Office of Management and Budget under 44 U.S.C. 3501 et 
seq.
