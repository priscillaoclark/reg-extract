SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION: The NCUA proposes to extend for three years, 
with revision, the NCUA Form 5300 Call Report.
    OMB Number: 3133-0004.
    Title: NCUA Form 5300 Call Report.
    Type of Review: Revision and extension of a currently approved 
collection.
    Abstract: Sections 106 and 202 of the Federal Credit Union Act 
require federally insured credit unions (FICUs) to make financial and 
other reports to the NCUA. Section 741.5 prescribes the method in which 
federally insured credit unions must submit this information to NCUA. 
NCUA Form 5300, Call Report, is used to file quarterly financial and 
statistical data through NCUA's online portal, CUOnline. The financial 
and statistical information is essential to NCUA in carrying out its 
responsibility for supervising federal credit unions. This information 
facilitates NCUA monitoring of credit unions with share accounts 
insured by the National Credit Union Share Insurance Fund (NCUSIF).
    Affected Public: Private sector: Not-for-profit institutions.
    Respondents: All federally insured credit unions.
    Estimated Number of Respondents: 4,533.
    Estimated Average Burden per Response: 4.0 hours.
    Estimated Total Annual Burden Hours: 72,528.
    Reason for Change: The number of respondents decreased.
    The proposed revisions to the Form 5300 instructions in this notice 
would not have a material impact on the existing burden estimates.
    Legal Basis and Need for Collections: The Call Report Form 5300 
information collections are mandatory under 12 U.S.C. 1756, 1766, and 
1782. Except for select sensitive items, the Call Report Form 5300 is 
not given confidential treatment.
    Credit union data reported on the Call Report is essential to the 
NCUA supervision and regulation of federal credit unions. This 
information also facilitates the NCUA monitoring of other credit unions 
with share accounts insured by the National Credit Union Share 
Insurance Fund.
    Credit unions submit Call Report data to the NCUA quarterly. Call 
Report data serve a regulatory or public policy purpose by assisting 
the NCUA in fulfilling its mission of ensuring the safety and soundness 
of individual credit unions and the credit union system, protecting 
consumer financial rights, as well as agency-specific missions 
affecting federal and state-chartered credit unions, such as ensuring 
financial stability and administering share insurance.

Form 5300--Call Report--Proposed Changes

Schedule A, Section 4

    (1) Adding two accounts for credit unions to report the number and 
amount of loans granted to credit union officials and senior executive 
staff year-to-date. This information will enhance NCUA's offsite 
supervision.
    (2) Removing two accounts for credit unions to report information 
related to Purchased Credit Impaired Loans. These accounts are no 
longer required to be disclosed by generally accepted accounting 
principles.

Schedule C, Section 4

    (1) Removing three accounts where credit unions previously reported 
information related to FRB Paycheck Protection Program Lending Facility 
loans. The Paycheck Protection Program Lending Facility is no longer 
available.
    (2) Adding one account for credit unions to report assets pledged 
to secure deposits, other funding arrangements, and other counterparty 
requirements. Adding this information will provide insight into the 
amount of total pledged assets and the availability of unencumbered 
assets to secure future borrowings.

Schedule D, Section 2

    (1) Adding three accounts for credit unions to report the number 
and amount of member brokered non-maturity shares. NCUA will use this 
information to evaluate funding behavior and market trends.
    (2) Adding five accounts for credit unions to report the number and

[[Page 75591]]

amount of member brokered term shares by remaining maturity. NCUA will 
use this information to evaluate funding behavior and market trends.
    (3) Adding three accounts for credit unions to report the number 
and amount of nonmember brokered non-maturity deposits. NCUA will use 
this information to evaluate funding behavior and market trends.
    (4) Adding five accounts for credit unions to report the number and 
amount of nonmember brokered term deposits by remaining maturity. NCUA 
will use this information to evaluate funding behavior and market 
trends.
    (5) Adding five accounts for credit unions to report the number and 
amount of all other nonmember deposits by remaining maturity. Adding 
this information will enable a more complete assessment of nonmember 
deposits.
    (6) Changed the caption for ``Accounts held by nonmember public 
units'' to ``Nonmember Public Unit Deposits''.
    (7) Added an account for the amount of Nonmember Credit Union 
Deposits. NCUA will use this information to evaluate compliance with 
nonmember deposit regulatory requirements.
    (8) Changed the caption for ``Accounts Held by Member Public 
Units'' to ``Member Public Unit Deposits''.
    (9) Added an account for credit unions to report the amount of 
Reciprocal Deposits. NCUA will use this information to evaluate funding 
behavior and market trends as competition for deposits continues to 
innovate.

Schedule D, Section 3

    (1) Added three accounts for credit unions to report the maturity 
distribution of total uninsured shares and deposits. NCUA will use this 
information to evaluate depositor behavior and the movement between 
uninsured non-maturity shares and share certificates.
    Request for Comment: Comments submitted in response to this notice 
will be summarized and included in the request for Office of Management 
and Budget approval. All comments will become a matter of public 
record. The public is invited to submit comments concerning: (a) 
whether the proposed revisions to the collection of information that 
are the subject of this notice are necessary for the proper performance

information on the respondents, including the use of automated 
collection techniques or other forms of information technology.
