SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION:

I. Comments

    FHFA seeks public comments on the revision(s) to the system of 
records and will take all comments into consideration. See 5 U.S.C. 
552a(e)(4) and (11). In addition to referencing ``Comments/No. 2022-N-
4,'' please reference ``FHFA-18, Reasonable Accommodation and Personal 
Assistance Services Information System.''
    FHFA will make all comments timely received available for

II. Introduction

    This notice informs the public of FHFA's proposed revision(s) to an 
existing system of records. This notice satisfies the Privacy Act 
requirement that an agency publishes a system of records notice in the 
Federal Register when there is an addition or change to an agency's 
systems of records. Congress has recognized that application of all 
requirements of the Privacy Act to certain categories of records may 
have an undesirable and often unacceptable effect upon agencies in the 
conduct of necessary public business. Consequently, Congress 
established general exemptions and specific exemptions that could be 
used to exempt records from provisions of the Privacy Act. Congress 
also required that exempting records from provisions of the Privacy Act 
would require the head of an agency to publish a determination to 
exempt a record from the Privacy Act as a rule in accordance with the 
Administrative Procedure Act. Records and information in this system of 
records are not exempt from the requirements of the Privacy Act.
    As required by the Privacy Act, 5 U.S.C. 552a(r), and pursuant to 
section 7 of Office of Management and Budget (OMB) Circular No. A-108, 
``Federal Agency Responsibilities for Review, Reporting, and 
Publication under the Privacy Act'', prior to publication of this 
notice, FHFA submitted a report describing the system of records 
covered by this notice to the OMB, the Committee on Oversight and 
Government Reform of the House of Representatives, and the Committee on 
Homeland Security and Governmental Affairs of the Senate.

III. Revised Systems of Records

    The revised system of records notice is set out in its entirety and 
described in detail below. The proposed modification to the System 
makes the following substantive and nonsubstantive changes:
    (1) Adds new authorities, revises the purpose, and expands the 
categories of individuals covered by the system, the categories of 
records in the system, and the records source categories, to allow FHFA 
to collect and maintain information required to process religious 
accommodation requests provided for under Title VII of the Civil Rights 
Act of 1964 (CRA), as amended.
    (2) Revises existing routine uses language to be consistent with 
FHFA's standard routine uses, deletes routine use 7, and merges routine 
uses 13 and 14.
    (3) Updates the Security Classification section as Controlled 
Unclassified due to FHFA's transition to a controlled unclassified 
information policy to align with the National Archives and Records 
Administration (NARA).
    (4) Makes other general and administrative updates to the remaining

[[Page 17087]]

sections of the notice in accordance with the OMB Circular A-108.
    Information in this System is used to collect, maintain, evaluate, 
approve, deny, and/or implement requests for a reasonable accommodation 
or personal assistance services under sections 501, 504, and 701 of the 
Rehabilitation Act of 1973; 29 CFR part 1630; the Americans with 
Disabilities Act (ADA) Amendments of 2008; Title VII of the Civil 
Rights Act of 1964; and 29 CFR part 1605.

assistance services to ensure compliance with applicable laws and 
regulations, and to preserve and maintain the confidentiality of 
medical and religious information.
