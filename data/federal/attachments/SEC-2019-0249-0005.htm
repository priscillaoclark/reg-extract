    Notice is hereby given that, pursuant to the Paperwork Reduction 
Act of 1995 (44 U.S.C. 3501 et seq.) (the ``Paperwork Reduction Act''), 
the Securities and Exchange Commission (``Commission'') is soliciting 
comments on the collection of information summarized below. The 
Commission plans to submit this existing collection of information to 
the Office of Management and Budget for extension and approval.
    Form ID (OMB Control No. 3235-0328) must be completed and filed 
with the Commission by all individuals, companies, and other 
organizations who seek access to file electronically on the 
Commission's Electronic Data Gathering, Analysis, and Retrieval system 
(``EDGAR''). Those seeking access to file on EDGAR typically include 
those who are required to make certain disclosures pursuant to the 
federal securities laws. The information provided on Form ID is an 
essential part of the security of EDGAR. Form ID must be submitted 
whenever an applicant seeks an EDGAR identification number (Central 
Index Key or CIK) and/or access codes to file on EDGAR. The currently 
approved burden includes an estimate of 66,519 Form ID filings annually 
and a further estimate that it takes approximately 0.279289 hours per 
response for a total annual burden of 18,578 hours.
    Written comments are invited on: (a) whether this proposed 
collection of information is necessary for the proper performance of 
the functions of the agency, including whether the information will 
have practical utility; (b) the accuracy of the agency's estimate of 
the burden imposed by the collection of information; (c) ways to 
enhance the quality, utility, and clarity of the information collected; 
and (d) ways to minimize the burden of the collection of information on 
respondents, including through the use of automated collection 
techniques or other forms of information technology. Consideration will 
be given to comments and suggestions submitted in writing within 60 
days of this publication by January 27, 2025.
    An agency may not conduct or sponsor, and a person is not required 
to respond to, a collection of information unless it displays a 
currently valid control number.
    Please direct your written comment to Austin Gerig, Director/Chief 
Data Officer, Securities and Exchange Commission, c/o Tanya Ruttenberg, 
100 F Street NE, Washington, DC 20549 or send an email to:
