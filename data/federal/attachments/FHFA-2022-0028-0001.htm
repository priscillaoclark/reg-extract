SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION: 

I. Background

    FHFA is an independent agency of the Federal government, and the 
financial safety and soundness regulator of the Federal National 
Mortgage Association (Fannie Mae) and the Federal Home Loan Mortgage 
Corporation (Freddie Mac) (collectively, the Enterprises), as well as 
the Federal Home Loan Banks (collectively, the Banks) and the Office of 
Finance under authority granted by the Federal Housing Enterprises 
Financial Safety and Soundness Act of 1992 (Safety and Soundness 
Act).\1\ FHFA oversees the Enterprises and Banks (collectively, the 
regulated entities) and the Office of Finance to ensure that they 
operate in a safe and sound manner and maintain liquidity in the 
housing finance market in accordance with applicable laws, rules and 
regulations. To that end, FHFA is vested with broad supervisory 
discretion and specific civil administrative enforcement powers, 
similar to such authority granted by Congress to the Federal bank 
regulatory agencies.\2\ Section 1376 of the Safety and Soundness Act 
(12 U.S.C. 4636) empowers FHFA to impose civil money penalties under 
specific conditions. FHFA's Rules of Practice and Procedure (12 CFR 
part 1209) (the Enforcement regulations) govern cease and desist 
proceedings, civil money penalty assessment proceedings, and other 
administrative adjudications.\3\ FHFA's Flood Insurance regulation (12 
CFR part 1250) governs flood insurance responsibilities as they pertain 
to the Enterprises.\4\ FHFA's Implementation of the Program Fraud Civil 
Remedies Act of 1986 regulation (12 CFR part 1217) sets forth 
procedures for imposing civil penalties and assessments under the 
Program Fraud Civil Remedies Act (31 U.S.C. 3801 et seq.) on any person 
that makes a false claim for property, services or money from FHFA, or 
makes a false material statement to FHFA in connection with a claim, 
where the amount involved does not exceed $150,000.\5\

The Adjustment Improvements Act

    The Federal Civil Penalties Inflation Adjustment Act of 1990 
(Inflation Adjustment Act), as amended by the Federal Civil Penalties 
Inflation Adjustment Act Improvements Act of 2015 (Adjustment 
Improvements Act), requires FHFA, as well as other federal agencies 
with the authority to issue civil money penalties (CMPs), to adjust by 
regulation the maximum amount of each CMP authorized by law that the 
agency has jurisdiction to administer.\6\ The Adjustment Improvements 
Act required agencies to make an initial ``catch-up'' adjustment of 
their CMPs upon the statute's enactment,\7\ and further requires 
agencies to make additional adjustments on an annual basis following 
the initial adjustment.\8\
---------------------------------------------------------------------------

    \6\ See 28 U.S.C. 2461 note.
    \7\ FHFA promulgated its catch-up adjustment of its CMPs with an 
interim final rule published July 1, 2016. 81 FR 43028.
    \8\ FHFA promulgated its most recent annual adjustment of its 
CMP with a final rule published January 12, 2022. 87 FR 1659.
---------------------------------------------------------------------------

    The Adjustment Improvements Act sets forth the formula that 
agencies must apply when making annual adjustments, based on the 
percent change between the October Consumer Price Index for All Urban 
Consumers (the CPI-U) preceding the date of the last adjustment and the 
October CPI-U for the year before that.

II. Description of the Rule

    This final rule adjusts the maximum penalty amount within each of 
the three tiers specified in 12 U.S.C. 4636 by amending the table 
contained in 12 CFR 1209.80 of the Enforcement regulations to reflect 
the new adjusted maximum penalty amount that FHFA may impose upon a 
regulated entity or any entity-affiliated party within each tier. The 
increases in maximum penalty amounts contained in this final rule may 
not necessarily affect the amount of any CMP that FHFA may seek for a 
particular violation, which may not be the maximum that the law allows; 
FHFA would calculate each CMP on a case-by-case basis in light of a 
variety of

[[Page 80024]]

factors.\9\ This rule also adjusts the maximum penalty amounts for 
violations under the FHFA Flood Insurance regulation by amending the 
text of 12 CFR 1250.3 to reflect the new adjusted maximum penalty 
amount that FHFA may impose for violations under that regulation. This 
rule also adjusts the maximum amounts for civil money penalties under 
the Program Fraud Civil Remedies Act by amending the text of 12 CFR 
1217.3 to reflect the new adjusted maximum penalty amount that FHFA may 
impose for violations under that regulation.
---------------------------------------------------------------------------

    \9\ See, e.g., 12 CFR 1209.7(c); FHFA Enforcement Policy, AB 
2013-03 (May 31, 2013).
---------------------------------------------------------------------------

    The Adjustment Improvements Act directs federal agencies to 
calculate each annual CMP adjustment as the percent change between the 
CPI-U for the previous October and the CPI-U for October of the 
calendar year before.\10\ The maximum CMP amounts for FHFA penalties 
were last adjusted in 2022.\11\ Since FHFA is making this round of 
adjustments in calendar year 2023, and the maximum CMP amounts were 
last set in calendar year 2022, the inflation adjustment amount for 
each maximum CMP amount was calculated by comparing the CPI-U for 
October 2021 with the CPI-U for October 2022, resulting in an inflation 
factor of 1.07745. For each maximum CMP calculation, the product of 
this inflation adjustment and the previous maximum penalty amount was 
then rounded to the nearest whole dollar as required by the Adjustment 
Improvements Act, and was then summed with the previous maximum penalty 
amount to determine the new adjusted maximum penalty amount.\12\ The 
tables below set out these items accordingly.

                                         calendar year.
----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

III. Differences Between the Federal Home Loan Banks and the 
Enterprises

    When promulgating any regulation that may have future effect 
relating to the Banks, the Director is required by section 1313(f) of 
the Safety and Soundness Act to consider the differences between the 
Banks and the Enterprises with respect to the Banks' cooperative 
ownership structure, mission of providing liquidity to members, 
affordable housing and community development mission, capital 
structure, and joint and several liability (12 U.S.C. 4513(f)).\13\ The 
Director considered the differences between the Banks and the 
Enterprises, as they relate to the above factors, and determined that 
this final rule is appropriate. The inflation adjustments effected by 
the final rule are mandated by law, and the special features of the 
Banks identified in section 1313(f) of the Safety and Soundness Act can 
be accommodated, if appropriate, along with any other relevant factors, 
when determining any actual penalties.
---------------------------------------------------------------------------

    \13\ So in original; no paragraphs (d) and (e) were enacted. See 
12 U.S.C.A. 4513 n 1.
---------------------------------------------------------------------------

IV. Regulatory Impact

Administrative Procedure Act

    FHFA finds good cause that notice and an opportunity to comment on 
this final rule are unnecessary under section 553(b) of the 
Administrative Procedure Act (APA), 5 U.S.C. 553(b). The Adjustment 
Improvements Act states that the annual civil money penalty adjustments 
shall be made notwithstanding the rulemaking provisions of 5 U.S.C. 
553.\14\ Furthermore, this rulemaking conforms with and is consistent 
with the statutory directive set forth in the Adjustment Improvements 
Act. As a result, there are no issues of policy discretion about which 
to seek public comment. Accordingly, FHFA is adopting these amendments 
as a final rule.

Regulatory Flexibility Act

    Pursuant to the Regulatory Flexibility Act (RFA),\15\ an agency 
must prepare a regulatory flexibility analysis for all proposed and 
final rules that describes the impact of the rule on small entities, 
unless the head of an agency certifies that the rule will not have ``a 
significant economic impact on a substantial number of small 
entities.'' However, the RFA applies only to rules for which an agency 
publishes a general notice of proposed rulemaking pursuant to the 
APA.\16\ As discussed above, FHFA has determined for good cause that 
the APA does not require a general notice of proposed rulemaking for 
this rule. Thus, the RFA does not apply to this final rule.

    \16\ 5 U.S.C. 603(a), 604(a).
---------------------------------------------------------------------------

Congressional Review Act

    The rule is not a ``major rule'' as defined by the Congressional 
Review Act, codified at 5 U.S.C. 801 et seq. The rule will not result 
in: (1) An annual effect on the economy of $100,000,000 or more; (2) a 
major increase in costs or prices; or (3) significant adverse effects 
on competition, employment, investment, productivity, innovation, or 
the ability of United States-based companies to compete with foreign-
based companies.\17\

Paperwork Reduction Act

    The Paperwork Reduction Act (44 U.S.C. 3501 et seq.) requires that 
regulations involving the collection of information receive clearance 
from the Office of Management and Budget (OMB). This rule contains no 
such collection of information requiring OMB approval under the 
Paperwork Reduction Act. Consequently, no information has been 
submitted to OMB for review.
