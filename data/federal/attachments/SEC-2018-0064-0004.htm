SECURITIES AND EXCHANGE COMMISSION

[SEC File No. 270-170, OMB Control No. 3235-0167]


Proposed Collection; Comment Request; Extension: Form 15

Upon Written Request Copies Available From: Securities and Exchange 
Commission, Office of FOIA Services, 100 F Street NE, Washington, DC 
20549-2736

    Notice is hereby given that, pursuant to the Paperwork Reduction 
Act of 1995 (44 U.S.C. 3501 et seq.), the Securities and Exchange 
Commission (``Commission'') is soliciting comments on the collection of 
information summarized below. The Commission plans to submit this 
existing collection of information to the Office of Management and 
Budget for extension and approval.
    Form 15 (17 CFR 249.323) is a certification of termination of a 
class of security under Section 12(g) or notice of suspension of duty 
to file reports pursuant to Sections 13 and 15(d) of the Securities 
Exchange Act of 1934 (15 U.S.C. 78a et seq.). We estimate that 
approximately 684 issuers file Form 15 annually and it takes 
approximately 1.5 hours per response to prepare for a total of 1,026 
annual burden hours (1.5 hours per response x 684 responses).
    Written comments are invited on: (a) whether this proposed 
collection of information is necessary for the proper performance of 
the functions of the agency, including whether the information will 
have practical utility; (b) the accuracy of the agency's estimate of 
the burden imposed by the collection of information; (c) ways to 
enhance the quality, utility, and clarity of the information collected; 
and (d) ways to minimize the burden of the collection of information on 
respondents, including through the use of automated collection 
techniques or other forms of information technology. Consideration will 
be given

to comments and suggestions submitted in writing within 60 days of this 
publication by June 14, 2024.
    An agency may not conduct or sponsor, and a person is not required 
to respond to, a collection of information unless it displays a 
currently valid control number.
    Please direct your written comment to David Bottom, Director/Chief 
Information Officer, Securities and Exchange Commission, c/o John 
Pezzullo, 100 F Street NE, Washington, DC 20549 or send an email to:
