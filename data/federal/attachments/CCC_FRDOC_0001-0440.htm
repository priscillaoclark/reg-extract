SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION: 
    Title: Regional Agricultural Promotion Program.
    OMB Number: 0551-0049.
    Expiration Date of Approval: August 31, 2025.
    Type of Request: Revision of a currently approved information 
collection.
    Abstract: Under the Regional Agricultural Promotion Program (RAPP), 
information will be gathered from applicants to the program and from 
existing program participants that have been approved to conduct market 
promotion activities that promote U.S. agricultural commodities in 
foreign markets, including activities that address existing or 
potential non-tariff barriers to trade. The information collected will 
be used primarily by FAS to manage, plan, evaluate, and account for 
government resources. This revision is necessary to update the burden 
estimate to account for new applications being received under RAPP.
    Estimate of Burden: The public reporting burden for each respondent 
resulting from information collected under the RAPP varies in direct 
relation to the number and type of agreements entered into by such 
respondents. The estimated average reporting burden for the RAPP is 16 
hours per response.
    Type of Respondents: Nonprofit U.S. agricultural trade 
organizations, nonprofit state regional trade groups, U.S. agricultural 
cooperatives, and state agencies.
    Estimated Number of Respondents: 70 per annum.
    Estimated Number of Responses per Respondent: 55 per annum.
    Estimated Total Annual Burden of Respondents: 55,029 hours.
