SECURITIES AND EXCHANGE COMMISSION

[SEC File No. 270-563, OMB Control No. 3235-0693]


Submission for OMB Review; Comment Request; Extension: Rules 17g-
8 and 17g-9

Upon Written Request, Copies Available From: Securities and Exchange 
Commission, Office of FOIA Services, 100 F Street NE, Washington, DC 
20549-2736

    Notice is hereby given that pursuant to the Paperwork Reduction Act 
of 1995 (44 U.S.C. 3501 et seq.), the Securities and Exchange 
Commission (``Commission'') is soliciting comments on the collection of 
information summarized below. The Commission plans to submit an 
extension for this current collection of information to the Office of 
Management and Budget for approval.
    Rules 17g-8 and 17g-9 (17 CFR 240.17g-8 and 17 CFR 240.17g-9) set 
forth collection of information requirements. Rule 17g-8 requires 
nationally recognized statistical rating

organizations (``NRSROs'') to establish, maintain, enforce, and 
document policies and procedures that are reasonably designed to 
achieve the objectives articulated in the rule. Generally, these 
policies and procedures pertain to (i) the procedures and methodologies 
NRSROs use to determine credit ratings, and (ii) the symbols, numbers, 
or scores NRSROs use to denote credit ratings.\1\ Rule 17g-8 also 
requires that the policies and procedures an NRSRO is required to 
establish, maintain, and enforce pursuant to Section 15E(h)(4)(A) of 
the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 must, at a minimum, include 
policies and procedures reasonably designed to achieve the objectives 
articulated in the rule.\2\ Rule 17g-9 requires each NRSRO to 
establish, maintain, enforce, and document standards of training, 
experience, and competence for the individuals it employs to 
participate in the determination of credit ratings that are reasonably 
designed to achieve the objective that the NRSRO produces accurate 
credit ratings.\3\

    \1\ See 240.17g-8(a) and (b).
    \2\ See 240.17g-8(c).
    \3\ See 240.17g-9.
---------------------------------------------------------------------------

    Based on Commission staff's experience, it is estimated that the 
total annual burden for NRSROs to comply with Rule 17g-8 and Rule 17g-9 
is 1,450 hours and 34,658 hours, respectively. The Commission further 
estimates that these annual hour burdens will result in a total annual 
cost with respect to Rule 17g-8 of $539,400 and with respect to Rule 
17g-9 of $12,951,746. These costs are attributable to costs NRSROs may 
incur in completing updates and other activities relating to the 
policies and procedures adopted pursuant to Rule 17g-8 and the 
standards adopted pursuant to Rule 17g-9, and in conducting the 
periodic testing of credit analysts pursuant to standards adopted under 
Rule 17g-9.
    An agency may not conduct or sponsor, and a person is not required 
to respond to, a collection of information under the PRA unless it
