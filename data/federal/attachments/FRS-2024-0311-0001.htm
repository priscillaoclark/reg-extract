    As background, the International Association of Insurance 
Supervisors (IAIS) is developing the Insurance Capital Standard (ICS) 
as a consolidated group-wide capital standard for internationally 
active insurance groups, to create a common language for insurance 
supervisors and enhance global convergence on insurance capital 
regulation.\4\ The IAIS also is assessing whether the Aggregation 
Method developed by the United States provides comparable outcomes to 
the ICS. If so, it will be considered an outcome-equivalent approach 
for implementation of the ICS as a prescribed capital requirement.\5\
