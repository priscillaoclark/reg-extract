SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION:
    Title: Rule 50.50 End-User Notification of Non-Cleared Swap (OMB 
Control No. 3038-0085). This is a request for an extension of a 
currently approved information collection.
    Abstract: CFTC Rule 50.50 specifies the requirements for eligible 
end-users who may elect the end-user exception from the Commission's 
swap clearing requirement, as provided under section 2(h)(7) of the 
Commodity Exchange Act (``CEA''). Rule 50.50 requires the 
counterparties to report certain information to a swap data repository 
registered with the Commission, or to the Commission directly, if one 
or more counterparties elects the end-user exception. The rule 
establishes a reporting requirement for end-users that is critical to 
ensuring compliance with the Commission's clearing requirement under 
section 2(h)(1) of the CEA and is necessary in order for Commission 
staff to prevent abuse of the end-user exception. In addition, this 
collection relates to information that the Commission needs to monitor 
elections of the end-user exception and to assess market risks.
    An agency may not conduct or sponsor, and a person is not required 
to respond to, a collection of information unless it displays a 
currently valid OMB control number.\2\ On August 18, 2022, the 
Commission published in the Federal Register notice of the proposed 
extension of this information collection and provided 60 days for 
public comment on the proposed extension, 87 FR 50849 (``60-Day 
Notice''). The Commission did not receive any comments on the 60-Day 
Notice.
