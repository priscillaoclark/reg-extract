Control No. 3038-0007.

SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION: 
    Title: Regulation of Domestic Exchange-Traded Options, OMB Control 
Number 3038-0007. This is a request for extension of a currently 
approved collection.
    Abstract: Commission Regulations 33.7 and 33.8,\2\ respectively, 
require futures commission merchants (FCMs) and introducing brokers 
(IBs): (1) to provide retail (i.e., non-eligible contract participant) 
\3\ customers with, and retain, standard risk disclosure

[[Page 85175]]

statements concerning the risk of trading certain domestic exchange-
traded commodity options; \4\ and (2) to retain all related promotional 
material and the source of authority for information contained therein. 
These requirements help assure that these customers are not 
fraudulently induced to invest in these commodity options by persons 
who misrepresent the risks of such transactions. The recordkeeping 
requirements assist the Commission and the National Futures Association 
(NFA) in verifying registrants' compliance with their disclosure 
obligations and ensuring that related promotional material is not 
fraudulent or misleading.
---------------------------------------------------------------------------

    \2\ 17 CFR 33.7 and 33.8.
    \3\ Commission Regulation 33.7 does not require FCMs or IBs to 
provide the disclosure or obtain a related acknowledgment from 
institutional customers. See 17 CFR 33.7(a)(1). Commission 
Regulation 1.3 provides that ``institutional customer'' has the same 
meaning as ``eligible contract participant'' (``ECP'') as defined in 
section 1a(18) of the Commodity Exchange Act (``CEA''). Under the 
CEA, an ECP includes, for example, a financial institution, an 
insurance company, and a corporation with $10 million in assets.
    \4\ See Commission Regulation 33.2(b). 17 CFR 33.2(b) (providing 
that Part 33 of the Commission's Regulations applies to commodity 
option transactions that are options on contracts of sale of a 
commodity for future delivery except for commodity option 
transactions that are options on contracts of sale of a commodity 
for future delivery conducted or executed on or subject to the rules 
of a foreign board of trade).
---------------------------------------------------------------------------

    This information collection contains the third-party disclosure and 
recordkeeping requirements needed to ensure regulatory compliance by 
FCMs and IBs with these Commission Regulations.
    An agency may not conduct or sponsor, and a person is not required 
to respond to, a collection of information unless it displays a 
currently valid OMB control number. On August 12, 2024, the Commission 
published in the Federal Register notice of the proposed extension of 
this information collection and provided 60 days for public comment on 
the proposed extension, 89 FR 65606 (``60-Day Notice''). The Commission 
did not receive any relevant comments on the 60-Day Notice.
    Burden Statement: The Commission estimates the burden of this 
collection of information as follows:
    Estimated Number of Annual Respondents: 983.
    Estimated Average Annual Burden Hours per Respondent: 34.2.
    Estimated Total Annual Burden Hours: 33,619.
    Frequency of Collection: On occasion.
    There are no capital costs or operating and maintenance costs 
associated with this collection.

(Authority: 44 U.S.C. 3501 et seq.)

    Dated: October 22, 2024.
Robert Sidman,
Deputy Secretary of the Commission.
