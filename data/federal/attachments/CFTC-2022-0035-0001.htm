SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION: 
    Title: Core Principles & Other Requirements for DCMs (OMB Control 
No. 3038-0052). This is a request for a revision and extension of a 
currently approved information collection.
    Abstract: The regulations governing designated contract markets 
(``DCMs'') originally were adopted pursuant to the Commodity Futures 
Modernization Act of 2000, which amended section 5 of the Commodity 
Exchange Act (``CEA'') to impose requirements concerning the 
registration \2\ and operation of DCMs.\3\ The DCM statutory framework 
subsequently was revised as a result of further amendments to the CEA 
under Title VII of the Dodd-Frank Wall Street Reform and Consumer 
Protection Act (``Dodd-Frank Act'').\4\ Part 38 of the Commission's 
regulations governs the activities of DCMs. The information collected 
pursuant to Part 38 is necessary for the Commission to evaluate whether 
entities operating as, or applying to become, DCMs comply with the Part 
38 and other Commission requirements and the CEA's statutory 
requirements.
---------------------------------------------------------------------------

    \2\ The Commission notes that the terms ``registered'' and 
``designated'' are used interchangeably and mean the same thing.
    \3\ 7 U.S.C. 1 et seq.
    \4\ See Dodd-Frank Wall Street Reform and Consumer Protection 
Act, Public Law 111-203, tit. VII, 124 Stat. 1376 (2010) (codified 
as amended in various sections of 7 U.S.C.), available at <a href="https://www.cftc.gov/sites/default/files/idc/groups/public/@lrfederalregister/documents/file/2013-12242a.pdf">https://www.cftc.gov/sites/default/files/idc/groups/public/@lrfederalregister/documents/file/2013-12242a.pdf</a>.
---------------------------------------------------------------------------

    Collection 3038-0052 was created in response to the Part 38 
regulatory requirements for DCMs. In general, OMB Control Number 3038-
0052 covers all information collections in Part 38, including Subpart A 
and the DCM core principles (i.e., Subparts B through X) as well as the 
related appendices thereto (i.e., Appendix A--Form DCM; Appendix B--
Guidance on, and Acceptable Practices in, Compliance with Core 
Principles; and Appendix C--Demonstration of Compliance That a Contract 
Is Not Readily Susceptible to Manipulation). Further, this OMB control 
number, 3038-0052, also includes all information collections related to 
Part 9 (``Rules Relating to Review of Exchange Disciplinary, Access 
Denial or Other Adverse Actions'') to the extent Part 9 is applicable 
to DCMs.\5\ This collection also includes the requirements under 
regulation 38.251(g) in connection with the reporting of specific 
market disruption events to the Commission.
---------------------------------------------------------------------------

    \5\ Section 38.707 specifically references Part 9. Accordingly, 
the Commission's previous information collection estimates under 
Part 38 have included compliance with Part 9 to the extent 
applicable to DCMs. The Commission is referencing DCMs' compliance 
obligations with Part 9 for the sake of clarity, but this does not 
represent a new or modified information collection.
---------------------------------------------------------------------------

    This OMB control number, 3038-0052, also includes collections under 
regulation 1.52 regarding the Enhanced Protections Afforded Customer 
and Customer Funds Held by Futures Clearing Merchants and Derivatives 
Clearing Organizations. Commission regulation 1.52 imposes information 
collection burdens on DCMs.\6\
---------------------------------------------------------------------------

    \6\ The Commission notes that Sec.  38.605 incorporates and 
references Sec.  1.52. Accordingly, the Commission's previous 
information collection estimates under Part 38 have included 
compliance with Sec.  1.52 to the extent applicable to DCMs. The 
Commission is referencing DCMs' compliance obligations with Sec.  
1.52 for the sake of clarity, but this does not represent a new or 
modified information collection.
---------------------------------------------------------------------------

    Additionally, this OMB control number, 3038-0052, also includes 
collections under regulation 38.1051(n) that relate to system 
safeguards and cybersecurity testing requirements and requires DCMs to 
provide the Commission with annual trading volume information.
    For the majority of collections under OMB control number 3038-0052, 
the Commission notes that the number of registered, active DCMs has 
increased from 14 to 16. This increase in the number of registered DCMs 
will increase the total information collection burdens for OMB control 
number 3038-0052 as shown below.\7\
---------------------------------------------------------------------------

    \7\ For the collections related to Commission regulation 
38.251(g), the Commission notes that the number of registered, 
active DCMs has decreased from 17 to 16. This decrease is reflected 
below for collections related to Commission regulation 38.251(g). 
However, despite this decrease, the total information collection 
burdens for OMB control number 3038-0052 will increase.

respond to, a collection of information unless it displays a currently 
valid OMB control number. On April 28, 2022, the Commission published 
in the Federal Register notice of the proposed extension of this 
information collection and provided 60 days for public comment on the 
proposed extension, 87 FR 25228 (``60-Day Notice''). The Commission did 
not receive any relevant comments on the 60-Day Notice.
