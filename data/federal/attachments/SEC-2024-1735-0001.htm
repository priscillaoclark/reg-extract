    \2\ 17 CFR 240.19b-4.
---------------------------------------------------------------------------

I. Self-Regulatory Organization's Statement of the Terms of Substance 
of the Proposed Rule Change

    The Exchange proposes to amend Options 9, Section 13, Position 
Limits, and Section 15, Exercise Limits.
    The text of the proposed rule change is available on the Exchange's 
website at <a href="https://listingcenter.nasdaq.com/rulebook/nasdaq/rules">https://listingcenter.nasdaq.com/rulebook/nasdaq/rules</a>, at 
the principal office of the Exchange, and at the Commission's Public 
Reference Room.

II. Self-Regulatory Organization's Statement of the Purpose of, and 
Statutory Basis for, the Proposed Rule Change

    In its filing with the Commission, the Exchange included statements 
concerning the purpose of and basis for the proposed rule change and 
discussed any comments it received on the proposed rule change. The 
text of these statements may be examined at the places specified in 
Item IV below. The Exchange has prepared summaries, set forth in 
sections A, B, and C below, of the most significant aspects of such 
statements.

A. Self-Regulatory Organization's Statement of the Purpose of, and 
Statutory Basis for, the Proposed Rule Change

1. Purpose
    The Exchange proposes to amend Options 9, Section 13, Position 
Limits, and Options 9, Section 15, Exercise Limits, to limit the 
position limits for options on the Fidelity Wise Origin Bitcoin Fund, 
the ARK21Shares Bitcoin ETF, the Grayscale Bitcoin Trust (BTC), the 
Grayscale Bitcoin Mini Trust BTC, and the Bitwise Bitcoin ETF 
(collectively ``Bitcoin Trusts'').
    Recently, Cboe Exchange, Inc. (``Cboe'') received approvals to list 
options on the Fidelity Wise Origin Bitcoin Fund, and the ARK21Shares 
Bitcoin ETF.\3\ Also, recently, NYSE American LLC (``NYSE American'') 
received approvals to list options on the Fidelity Wise Origin Bitcoin 
Fund, the ARK21Shares Bitcoin ETF, the Grayscale Bitcoin Trust (BTC), 
the Grayscale Bitcoin Mini Trust BTC, and the Bitwise Bitcoin ETF.\4\ 
Nasdaq ISE, LLC (``ISE'') filed a rule change to also list and trade 
options on the Bitcoin Trusts.\5\ BX's Options 4 Rules were amended by 
the ISE rule change as those Rules are incorporated by reference to 
ISE's Options 4 Rules, so BX has the ability to list the options on the 
Bitcoin Trusts. The Cboe Approval Order and the NYSE American Approval 
Order stated that the position and exercise limits for each of the 
Bitcoin Trusts shall be 25,000 contracts. At this time, the Exchange 
proposes to amend BX Option 9, Section 13 and Options 9, Section 15 to 
similarly note that options on the Fidelity Wise Origin Bitcoin Fund, 
the ARK21Shares Bitcoin ETF, the Grayscale Bitcoin Trust (BTC), the 
Grayscale Bitcoin Mini Trust BTC, and the Bitwise Bitcoin ETF shall 
have position and exercise limits of 25,000 contracts to mirror the 
Cboe Approval Order and the NYSE American Approval Order, respectively.
---------------------------------------------------------------------------

    \3\ See Securities Exchange Act Release No. 101387 (October 18, 
2024), 89 FR 84948 (October 24, 2024) (SR-Cboe-2024-035) (Notice of 
Filing of Amendment Nos. 2 and 3 and Order Granting Accelerated 
Approval of a Proposed Rule Change, as Modified by Amendment Nos. 2 
and 3, To Permit the Listing and Trading of Options on Bitcoin 
Exchange-Traded Funds) (``Cboe Approval Order'').
    \4\ See Securities Exchange Act Release No. 101386 (October 18, 
2024), 89 FR 84960 (October 24, 2024) (SR-NYSEAMER-2024-49) (Notice 
of Filing of Amendment No. 3 and Order Granting Accelerated Approval 
of a Proposed Rule Change, as Modified by Amendment No. 3, To Permit 
the Listing and Trading of Options on Bitcoin Exchange-Traded Funds) 
(``NYSE American Approval Order'').
    \5\ See SR-ISE-2024-54.
---------------------------------------------------------------------------

2. Statutory Basis
    The Exchange believes that its proposal is consistent with Section 
6(b) of the Act,\6\ in general, and furthers the objectives of Section 
6(b)(5) of the Act,\7\ in particular, in that it is designed to promote 
just and equitable principles of trade, to remove impediments to and 
perfect the mechanism of a free and open market and a national market 
system, and, in general to protect investors and the public interest.
---------------------------------------------------------------------------

    \6\ 15 U.S.C. 78f(b)
    \7\ 15 U.S.C. 78f(b)(5).
---------------------------------------------------------------------------

    The Exchange's proposal to amend Options 9, Section 13, Position 
Limits, and Options 9, Section 15, Exercise Limits, to provide that the 
position and exercise limits for options on each of the Bitcoin Trusts 
shall be 25,000 contracts is consistent with the Act as it will conform 
BX's options position and exercise limits for each of the Bitcoin 
Trusts with ISE's options position and exercise limits on these same 
Bitcoin Trusts to align those limits.\8\
---------------------------------------------------------------------------

    \8\ The Exchange believes that other exchanges will adopt 
position and exercise limits of 25,000 contracts for options on each 
of the Bitcoin Trusts. All Nasdaq affiliated markets have filed to 
adopt a 25,000 contract position and exercise limit for the Bitcoin 
Trusts.
---------------------------------------------------------------------------

B. Self-Regulatory Organization's Statement on Burden on Competition

    The proposed rule change does not impose any burden on competition 
that is not necessary or appropriate in furtherance of the purposes of 
the Act.
    Amending Options 9, Sections 13 and 15 to provide that the position 
and exercise limits for options on each of the Bitcoin Trusts shall be 
25,000 contracts does not impose an undue burden on competition as the 
position and exercise limits will apply to all trading for options on 
the Bitcoin Trusts trading on the Exchange as well as those trading on 
other exchanges that file a similar proposal.\9\
---------------------------------------------------------------------------

    \9\ All Nasdaq affiliated markets are filing to adopt a 25,000 
contract position and exercise limit for options on the Bitcoin 
Trusts.
---------------------------------------------------------------------------

C. Self-Regulatory Organization's Statement on Comments on the Proposed 
Rule Change Received From Members, Participants, or Others

    No written comments were either solicited or received.

III. Date of Effectiveness of the Proposed Rule Change and Timing for 
Commission Action

    The Exchange has filed the proposed rule change pursuant to Section 
19(b)(3)(A)(iii) of the Act \10\ and Rule

[[Page 95346]]

19b-4(f)(6) thereunder.\11\ Because the foregoing proposed rule change 
does not: (i) significantly affect the protection of investors or the 
public interest; (ii) impose any significant burden on competition; and 
(iii) become operative for 30 days from the date on which it was filed, 
or such shorter time as the Commission may designate, it has become 
effective pursuant to Section 19(b)(3)(A)(iii) of the Act \12\ and 
subparagraph (f)(6) of Rule 19b-4 thereunder.\13\
---------------------------------------------------------------------------

    \10\ 15 U.S.C. 78s(b)(3)(A)(iii).
    \11\ 17 CFR 240.19b-4(f)(6).
    \12\ 15 U.S.C. 78s(b)(3)(A)(iii).
    \13\ 17 CFR 240.19b-4(f)(6). In addition, Rule 19b-4(f)(6)(iii) 
requires a self-regulatory organization to give the Commission 
written notice of its intent to file the proposed rule change, along 
with a brief description and text of the proposed rule change, at 
least five business days prior to the date of filing of the proposed 
rule change, or such shorter time as designated by the Commission. 
The Commission waives this requirement.
---------------------------------------------------------------------------

    A proposed rule change filed under Rule 19b-4(f)(6) \14\ under the 
Act does not normally become operative prior to 30 days after the date 
of the filing. However, pursuant to Rule 19b-4(f)(6)(iii),\15\ the 
Commission may designate a shorter time if such action is consistent 
with the protection of investors and the public interest. The Exchange 
has requested that the Commission waive the 30-day operative delay so 
that the proposal may become operative immediately upon filing. The 
Commission previously approved the listing of options on the Fidelity 
Wise Origin Bitcoin Fund, the ARK21Shares Bitcoin ETF, the Grayscale 
Bitcoin Trust (BTC), the Grayscale Bitcoin Mini Trust BTC, and the 
Bitwise Bitcoin ETF.\16\ As noted above, BX's Options 4 Rules were 
amended by an ISE rule change \17\ as those Rules are incorporated by 
reference to ISE's Options 4 Rules, so BX has the ability to list the 
options on the Bitcoin Trusts. This proposal also establishes position 
and exercise limits for options on the Bitcoin Trusts. The Commission 
believes that waiver of the operative delay could benefit investors by 
assuring that trading Bitcoin Trust options are subject to the same 
position and exercise limits in place on other exchanges. Therefore, 
the Commission believes that waiver of the 30-day operative delay is 
consistent with the protection of investors and the public interest. 
Accordingly, the Commission hereby waives the 30-day operative delay 
and designates the proposed rule change as operative upon filing.\18\

18, 2024), 89 FR 84948 (October 24, 2024) (SR-Cboe-2024-035) (Notice 
of Filing of Amendment Nos. 2 and 3 and Order Granting Accelerated 
Approval of a Proposed Rule Change, as Modified by Amendment Nos. 2 
and 3, To Permit the Listing and Trading of Options on Bitcoin 
Exchange-Traded Funds). See also Securities Exchange Act Release No. 
101386 (October 18, 2024), 89 FR 84960 (October 24, 2024) (SR-
NYSEAMER-2024-49) (Notice of Filing of Amendment No. 3 and Order 
Granting Accelerated Approval of a Proposed Rule Change, as Modified 
by Amendment No. 3, To Permit the Listing and Trading of Options on 
Bitcoin Exchange-Traded Funds).
    \17\ See SR-ISE-2024-54.
    \18\ For purposes only of waiving the 30-day operative delay, 
the Commission has also considered the proposed rule's impact on 
efficiency, competition, and capital formation. See 15 U.S.C. 
78c(f).
---------------------------------------------------------------------------

    At any time within 60 days of the filing of the proposed rule 
change, the Commission summarily may temporarily suspend such rule 
change if it appears to the Commission that such action is necessary or 
appropriate in the public interest, for the protection of investors, or 
otherwise in furtherance of the purposes of the Act. If the Commission 
takes such action, the Commission shall institute proceedings to 
determine whether the proposed rule should be approved or disapproved.
