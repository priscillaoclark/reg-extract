SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION: On June 15, 1984, OMB delegated to the Board 
authority under the Paperwork Reduction Act (PRA) to approve and assign 
OMB control numbers to collections of information conducted or 
sponsored by the Board. In exercising this delegated authority, the 
Board is directed to take every reasonable step to solicit comment. In 
determining whether to approve a collection of information, the Board 
will consider all comments received from the public and other agencies.
    During the comment period for this proposal, a copy of the proposed 
PRA OMB submission, including the draft reporting form and 
instructions, supporting statement (which contains more detail about 
the information collection and burden estimates than this notice), and 
other documentation, will be made available on the Board's public 
website at <a href="https://www.federalreserve.gov/apps/reportingforms/home/review">https://www.federalreserve.gov/apps/reportingforms/home/review</a> or may be requested from the agency clearance officer, whose 
name appears above. Final versions of these documents will be made 
available at <a href="https://www.reginfo.gov/public/do/PRAMain">https://www.reginfo.gov/public/do/PRAMain</a>, if approved.

Request for Comment on Information Collection Proposal

    The Board invites public comment on the following information 
collection, which is being reviewed under authority delegated by the 
OMB under the PRA. Comments are invited on the following:
    a. Whether the proposed collection of information is necessary for 
the proper performance of the Board's functions, including whether the 
information has practical utility;
    b. The accuracy of the Board's estimate of the burden of the 
proposed information collection, including the validity of the 
methodology and assumptions used;
    c. Ways to enhance the quality, utility, and clarity of the 
information to be collected;
    d. Ways to minimize the burden of information collection on 
respondents, including through the use of automated collection 
techniques or other forms of information technology; and
    e. Estimates of capital or startup costs and costs of operation, 
maintenance, and purchase of services to provide information.
    At the end of the comment period, the comments and recommendations 
received will be analyzed to determine the extent to which the Board 
should modify the proposal.

Proposal Under OMB Delegated Authority To Extend for Three Years, With 
Revision, the Following Information Collection

    Collection title: Senior Financial Officer Surveys.
    Collection identifier: FR 2023.
    OMB control number: 7100-0223.
    General description of collection: The Board uses the surveys in 
this collection to gather qualitative and limited quantitative 
information about liability management, the provision of financial 
services, and the functioning of key financial markets from a selection 
of up to 80 large commercial banks and other depository institutions 
(or, if appropriate, from other major financial market participants). 
This voluntary survey is completed by a senior officer at each 
respondent institution. In recent years, the Board has conducted two 
surveys per year, but it may conduct up to four surveys per year when 
significant informational needs arise that cannot be met from existing 
data sources.
    Proposed revisions: The Board proposes to revise the FR 2023 by 
increasing the panel size from 80 to 100 and changing the method of 
collection from email to an online survey tool. An example of an online 
survey tool is a software platform by Qualtrics, a commercial 
experience management company that is a Federal Reserve vendor. The 
larger panel size is intended to obtain more data from relatively 
smaller depository institutions (those with between $1 billion and $50 
billion in total assets). Compared to the current data collection 
method (an emailed Excel spreadsheet), use of an online tool would 
enhance the survey with interactive features (such as posing follow-up 
questions based on respondent inputs), improved automated safeguards 
against data quality risks, workflow efficiency features such as 
response tracking and version control, and usability on mobile devices. 
These revisions would be effective on September 1, 2024.
    Frequency: Up to four times a year.
    Respondents: Domestic depository institutions and foreign banking 
organizations.
    Total estimated number of respondents: 100.
    Total estimated change in burden: 240.
    Total estimated annual burden hours: 1,200.\1\

including more detailed burden estimates, can be found in the OMB 
Supporting Statement posted at <a href="https://www.federalreserve.gov/apps/reportingforms/home/review">https://www.federalreserve.gov/apps/reportingforms/home/review</a>. On the page displayed at the link, you

identifier, FR 2023.
