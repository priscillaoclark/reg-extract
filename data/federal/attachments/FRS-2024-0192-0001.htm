Final Approval Under OMB Delegated Authority of the Extension for Three 
Years, Without Revision, of the Following Information Collection

    Collection title: Recordkeeping and Disclosure Requirements 
Associated with the CFPB's Regulation M.
    Collection identifier: FR M.
    OMB control number: 7100-0202.
    General description of collection: The Consumer Leasing Act (CLA) 
and Regulation M require lessors uniformly to disclose to consumers the 
costs, liabilities, and terms of consumer lease transactions. The Dodd-
Frank Wall Street Reform and Consumer Protection Act transferred 
rulemaking authority for the CLA to the Consumer Financial Protection 
Bureau (CFPB) except for certain motor vehicle dealers that are 
excluded from the CFPB's authority, which remain subject to the Board's 
Regulation M. The FR M is the Board's information collection associated 
with Regulation M. These disclosures are provided to consumers before 
they enter into lease transactions and in advertisements that state the 
availability of consumer leases on particular terms. The disclosures 
are intended to provide consumers with meaningful disclosures about the 
costs and terms of leases for personal property and enable consumers to 
compare the terms for a particular lease with those for other leases 
and, when appropriate, to compare lease terms with those for credit 
transactions.
    Frequency: Event generated.
    Respondents: The FR M panel comprises state member banks with 
assets of $10 billion or less that are not affiliated with an insured 
depository institution with assets over $10 billion (irrespective of 
the consolidated assets of any holding company); non depository 
affiliates of such state member banks; and non depository affiliates of 
bank holding companies that are not affiliated with an insured 
depository institution with assets over $10 billion. Notwithstanding 
the foregoing, the CFPB, and not the Board, has supervisory authority 
for Regulation M with respect to automobile leasing over non-banks 
defined as ``larger participants'' in the automobile finance market 
pursuant to 12 U.S.C. 5514 (implemented by 12 CFR 1090.108).
    Total estimated number of respondents: 3.
    Total estimated annual burden hours: 17.
    Current actions: On March 7, 2024, the Board published a notice in 
the Federal Register (89 FR 16567) requesting public comment for 60 
days on the extension, without revision, of the FR M. The comment 
period for this notice expired on May 6, 2024. The Board did not 
receive any comments.

    Board of Governors of the Federal Reserve System, July 23, 2024.
Michele Taylor Fennell,
Deputy Associate Secretary of the Board.
