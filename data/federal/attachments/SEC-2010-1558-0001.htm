Self-Regulatory Organizations; Notice of Filing and Immediate 
Effectiveness of Proposed Rule Change by New York Stock Exchange LLC To 
Amend the Exchange Price List

October 6, 2010.
    Pursuant to Section 19(b)(1) \1\ of the Securities Exchange Act of 
1934 (the ``Act'') \2\ and Rule 19b-4 thereunder,\3\ notice is hereby 
given that, on September 30, 2010, New York Stock Exchange LLC 
(``NYSE'' or the ``Exchange'') filed with the Securities and Exchange 
Commission (the ``Commission'') the proposed rule change as described 
in Items I and II below, which Items have been prepared by the self-
regulatory organization. The Commission is publishing this notice to

I. Self-Regulatory Organization's Statement of the Terms of Substance 
of the Proposed Rule Change

    The Exchange proposes to amend its 2010 Price List to assess 
monthly fees for the use of all ports that provide connectivity to its 
equity trading systems. The monthly fee for ports will be $100 per pair 
per month up to five pairs, then $500 for each additional five pairs. 
In its table of credits applicable to Supplemental Liquidity Providers 
(``SLPs''), the Exchange is modifying language referencing the SLP 
quoting requirement to reflect a recent rule filing that changed the 
standard from 3% to 10% of the regular trading day in any calendar 
month in order to receive a financial rebate and also added a volume 
requirement. The amended pricing will take effect on October 1, 2010. 
The text of the proposed rule change is available at the Exchange, at 
<A HREF="http://frwebgate.access.gpo.gov/cgi-bin/leaving.cgi?from=leavingFR.html&log=linklog&to=http://www.nyse.com">http://www.nyse.com</A>, at the Commission's Public Reference Room, and on

II. Self-Regulatory Organization's Statement of the Purpose of, and 
Statutory Basis for, the Proposed Rule Change

    In its filing with the Commission, the self-regulatory organization 
included statements concerning the purpose of, and basis for, the 
proposed rule change and discussed any comments it received on the 
proposed rule change. The text of those statements may be examined at 
the places specified in Item IV below. The Exchange has prepared 
summaries, set forth in sections A, B, and C below, of the most 
significant parts of such statements.

A. Self-Regulatory Organization's Statement of the Purpose of, and 
Statutory Basis for, the Proposed Rule Change

1. Purpose
    The Exchange proposes to amend its 2010 Price List to assess 
monthly fees for the use of all ports that provide connectivity to its 
equity trading systems. A number of other markets already charge such 
fees, but the Exchange has not previously done so.
    The level of activity with respect to a particular port will not 
affect the assessment of monthly fees, so even if a particular port 
that is available to a participant is not used, the participant will 
still be billed for that port. The monthly fee for ports will be $100 
per pair per month up to five pairs, then $500 for each additional five 
pairs. For example, the fee for seven pairs of ports will be $1,000 per 
month. Billing for ports will be based on the number of ports on the 
third business day prior to the end of the month.
    In its table of credits applicable to SLPs, the Exchange is 
modifying language referencing the SLP quoting requirement to reflect a 
recent rule filing that changed the standard from 3% to 10% of the 
regular trading day in any calendar month in order to receive a 
financial rebate and also added a volume requirement.\4\
---------------------------------------------------------------------------

    \4\ See Securities Exchange Act Release No. 62791 (August 30, 
2010), 75 FR 54411 (September 7, 2010) (File No. SR-NYSE-2010-60).
---------------------------------------------------------------------------

    These changes are intended to be effective immediately for all 
transactions beginning October 1, 2010.

[[Page 63233]]

2. Statutory Basis
    The Exchange believes that the proposed rule change is consistent 
with the provisions of Section 6 of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 
(the ``Act''),\5\ in general, and Section 6(b)(4) of the Act,\6\ in 
particular, in that it is designed to provide for the equitable 
allocation of reasonable dues, fees, and other charges among its 
members and other persons using its facilities. The Exchange believes 
that the proposal does not constitute an inequitable allocation of 
fees, as all similarly situated member organizations will be charged 
the same amount and access to the Exchange's market is offered on fair 
and non-discriminatory terms.

    \6\ 15 U.S.C. 78f(b)(4).
---------------------------------------------------------------------------

B. Self-Regulatory Organization's Statement on Burden on Competition

    The Exchange does not believe that the proposed rule change will 
impose any burden on competition that is not necessary or appropriate 
in furtherance of the purposes of the Act.

C. Self-Regulatory Organization's Statement on Comments on the Proposed 
Rule Change Received From Members, Participants or Others

    No written comments were solicited or received with respect to the 
proposed rule change.

III. Date of Effectiveness of the Proposed Rule Change and Timing for 
Commission Action

    The foregoing rule change is effective upon filing pursuant to 
Section 19(b)(3)(A) \7\ of the Act and subparagraph (f)(2) of Rule 19b-
4 \8\ thereunder, because it establishes a due, fee, or other charge 
imposed on its members by the NYSE.
---------------------------------------------------------------------------

    \7\ 15 U.S.C. 78s(b)(3)(A).
    \8\ 17 CFR 240.19b-4(f)(2).
---------------------------------------------------------------------------

    At any time within 60 days of the filing of the proposed rule 
change, the Commission summarily may temporarily suspend such rule 
change if it appears to the Commission that such action is necessary or 
appropriate in the public interest, for the protection of investors, or 
otherwise in furtherance of the purposes of the Act.
