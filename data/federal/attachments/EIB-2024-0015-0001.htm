SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION: This form will enable EXIM to identify the 
specific details of the proposed co-financing transaction between a 
U.S. exporter, EXIM, and a foreign export credit agency; the 
information collected includes vital facts such as the amount of U.S.-
made content in the export, the amount of financing requested from 
EXIM, and the proposed financing amount from the foreign export credit 
agency. These details are necessary for approving this unique 
transaction structure and coordinating our support with that of the 
foreign export credit agency to ultimately complete the transaction and 
support U.S. exports--and U.S. jobs.
