SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION:

Electronic Availability

    This document and additional information concerning OFAC is 
available on OFAC's website (<a href="https://ofac.treasury.gov">https://ofac.treasury.gov</a>).

Background

    On May 12, 2022, OFAC, in consultation with the Department of 
State, issued GL 22 to authorize certain transactions otherwise 
prohibited by the Syrian Sanctions Regulations, 31 CFR part 542 (the 
``Regulations''). GL 22 was made available on OFAC's website (<a href="https://ofac.treasury.gov">https://ofac.treasury.gov</a>) when it was issued. OFAC subsequently published GL 
22 in the Federal Register (88 FR 25278, April 28, 2023). GL 22 
includes an annex listing the areas of northwest and northeast Syria in 
which activities are authorized under GL 22.
    On June 6, 2024, OFAC, in consultation with the Department of 
State, amended the Regulations to include additional interpretive and 
definitional guidance, general licenses, and other regulatory 
provisions that will provide further guidance to the public. As part of 
this regulatory amendment, OFAC incorporated GL 22 into the Regulations 
as Sec.  542.533. OFAC is now publishing the annex to GL 22 as the List 
in the Federal Register. The text of the List is provided below.
