of foreign banks, and insured state savings associations that are

with total consolidated assets of $10 billion or more on or after the

SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION: On October 11, 2023, the FDIC published in 
the Federal Register a proposal to issue Guidelines as Appendix C to 
FDIC's standards for safety and soundness regulations in part 364 and 
make conforming amendments to parts 308 and 364 of its regulations.\1\ 
These Guidelines would apply to all insured state nonmember banks, 
state-licensed insured branches of foreign banks, and insured state 
savings associations that are subject to section 39 of the FDI Act with 
total consolidated assets of $10 billion or more on or after the 
effective date of the final Guidelines. The Guidelines are intended to 
set the FDIC's expectations for covered institutions regarding 
corporate governance, risk management, and oversight by the board of 
directors. The notice of proposed rulemaking stated that the comment 
period would close on December 11, 2023. The FDIC has received requests 
to extend the comment period. An extension of the comment period will 
provide additional opportunity for the public to consider the proposal 
and prepare comments, including to address the questions posed by the 
FDIC. Therefore, the FDIC is extending the end of the comment period 
for the proposal from December 11, 2023, to February 9, 2024.
