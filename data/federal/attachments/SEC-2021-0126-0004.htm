Extension:
    Rule 17g-3--Annual financial and other reports to be filed or 
furnished by nationally recognized statistical rating organizations.

    Notice is hereby given that, pursuant to the Paperwork Reduction 
Act of 1995 (44 U.S.C. 3501 et seq.) (``PRA''), the Securities and 
Exchange Commission (``Commission'') is soliciting comments on the 
collection of information summarized below. The Commission plans to 
submit an extension for this current collection of information to the 
Office of Management and Budget for approval.
    Rule 17g-3 (17 CFR 240.17g-3) under the Securities Exchange Act of 
1934 (15 U.S.C. 78a et seq.) contains certain reporting requirements 
for nationally recognized statistical rating organizations 
(``NRSROs''). Specifically, NRSROs are required to file with the 
Commission, on an annual basis, financial reports containing specified 
financial statements, certain financial condition reports, and a report 
on the internal control structure. NRSROs are also required to furnish 
a report of the number of credit rating actions taken during the most 
recently completed fiscal year.
    Currently, there are 10 credit rating agencies registered as NRSROs 
with the Commission. Based on staff experience, the Commission 
estimates that the total burden for NRSROs to comply with Rule 17g-3 is 
3,650 hours. In addition, the Commission estimates an industry-wide 
annual external cost to NRSROs of $350,000 to comply with Rule 17g-3, 
reflecting costs to engage the services of independent public 
accountants and outside counsel.
