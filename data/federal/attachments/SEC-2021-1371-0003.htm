SECURITIES AND EXCHANGE COMMISSION

[SEC File No. 270-298, OMB Control No. 3235-0337]


Proposed Collection; Comment Request; Extension: Rule 17Ac2-2

Upon Written Request, Copies Available From: Securities and Exchange 
Commission, Office of FOIA Services, 100 F Street NE, Washington, DC 
20549-2736.

    Notice is hereby given that pursuant to the Paperwork Reduction Act 
of 1995 (``PRA'') (44 U.S.C. 3501 et seq.), the Securities and Exchange 
Commission (``Commission'') is soliciting comments on the existing 
collection of information provided for in Rule 17Ac2-2 (17 CFR 
240.17Ac2-2) and Form TA-2 under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 
(15 U.S.C. 78a et seq.) (``Exchange Act''). The Commission plans to 
submit this existing collection of information to the Office of 
Management and Budget (``OMB'') for extension and approval.
    Rule 17Ac2-2 and Form TA-2 require registered transfer agents to 
file an annual report of their business activities with the Commission. 
These reporting requirements are designed to ensure that all registered 
transfer agents are providing the Commission with sufficient 
information on an annual basis about the transfer agent community and 
to permit the Commission to effectively monitor business activities of 
transfer agents.
    The amount of time needed to comply with the requirements of 
amended Rule 17Ac2-2 and Form TA-2 varies. Of the total 315 registered 
transfer agents, approximately 9.2% (or 29 registrants) would be 
required to complete only questions 1 through 3 and the signature 
section of amended Form TA-2, which the Commission estimates would take 
each registrant approximately 30 minutes, for a total burden of 
approximately 15 hours (29 x .5 hours = 14.5 rounded up to 15). 
Approximately 26.5% of registrants (or 84 registrants) would be 
required to answer questions 1 through 5, question 11, and the 
signature section, which the Commission estimates would take 
approximately 1 hour and 30 minutes, for a total of 126 hours (84 x 1.5 
hours). Approximately 64.2% of the registrants (or 203 registrants) 
would be required to complete the entire Form TA-2, which the 
Commission estimates would take approximately 6 hours, for a total of 
1,218 hours (203 x 6 hours). The aggregate annual burden on all 315 
registered transfer agents is thus approximately 1,359 hours (15 hours 
+ 126 hours + 1,218 hours) and the average annual burden per transfer 
agent is approximately 4.314 hours (1,359 / 315).
    Written comments are invited on: (a) whether the proposed 
collection of information is necessary for the proper performance of 
the functions of the Commission, including whether the information 
shall have practical utility; (b) the accuracy of the Commission's 
estimates of the burden of the proposed collection of information; (c) 
ways to enhance the quality, utility, and clarity of the information 
collected; and (d) ways to minimize the burden of the collection of 
information on respondents, including through the use of automated 
collection techniques or other forms of information technology. 
Consideration will be given to comments and suggestions submitted by 
January 3, 2025.
    An agency may not conduct or sponsor, and a person is not required 
to respond to, a collection of information under the PRA unless it 
displays a currently valid OMB control number.
    Please direct your written comments to: Austin Gerig, Director/
Chief Data Officer, Securities and Exchange Commission, c/o Tanya 
Ruttenberg, 100 F Street NE, Washington, DC 20549, or send an email to:

Assistant Secretary.
