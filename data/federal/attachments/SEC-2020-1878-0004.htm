SECURITIES AND EXCHANGE COMMISSION

[SEC File No. 270-177, OMB Control No. 3235-0177]


Submission for OMB Review; Comment Request; Extension: Rule 6e-2 
and Form N-6EI-1

Upon Written Request, Copies Available From: Securities and Exchange 
Commission, Office of FOIA Services, 100 F Street NE, Washington, DC 
20549-2736

    Notice is hereby given that, pursuant to the Paperwork Reduction 
Act of 1995 (44 U.S.C. 3501 et seq.), the Securities and Exchange 
Commission (``Commission'') has submitted to the Office of Management 
and Budget a request for extension of the previously approved 
collection of information discussed below.
    Rule 6e-2 (17 CFR 270.6e-2) under the Investment Company Act of 
1940 (``Act'')
    (15 U.S.C. 80a) is an exemptive rule that provides separate 
accounts formed by life insurance companies to fund certain variable 
life insurance products, exemptions from certain provisions of the Act, 
subject to conditions set forth in the rule.
    Rule 6e-2 provides a separate account with an exemption from the 
registration provisions of section 8(a) of the Act if the account files 
with the Commission
    Form N-6EI-1 (17 CFR 274.301), a notification of claim of 
exemption.
    The rule also exempts a separate account from a number of other 
sections

[[Page 86983]]

of the Act, provided that the separate account makes certain disclosure 
in its registration statements (in the case of those separate accounts 
that elect to register), reports to contract holders, proxy 
solicitations, and submissions to state regulatory authorities, as 
prescribed by the rule.
    Since 2008, there have been no filings of Form N-6EI-1 by separate 
accounts. Therefore, there has been no cost or burden to the industry 
since that time. The Commission requests authorization to maintain an 
inventory of one burden hour for administrative purposes.
    An agency may not conduct or sponsor, and a person is not required 
to respond to, a collection of information unless it displays a 
currently valid control number.

collection at the following website: <a href="http://www.reginfo.gov">www.reginfo.gov</a>. Find this 
particular information collection by selecting ``Currently under 30-day
