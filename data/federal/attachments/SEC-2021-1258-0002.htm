SECURITIES AND EXCHANGE COMMISSION

[SEC File No. 270-666, OMB Control No. 3235-0725]


Proposed Collection; Comment Request; Extension: Contract 
Standard for Contractor Workforce Inclusion

Upon Written Request Copies Available From: U.S. Securities and 
Exchange Commission, Office of FOIA Services, 100 F Street NE, 
Washington, DC 20549-2736

    Notice is hereby given that, pursuant to the Paperwork Reduction 
Act of 1995 (44 U.S.C. 3501 et seq.), the Securities and Exchange 
Commission (``Commission'') is soliciting comments on the collection of 
information summarized below. The Commission plans to submit this 
existing collection of information to the Office of Management and 
Budget (``OMB'') for extension and approval.
    Section 342 of the Dodd-Frank Wall Street Reform and Consumer 
Protection Act of 2010 (the Dodd-Frank Act) provided that certain 
agencies, including the Commission, establish an Office of Minority and 
Women Inclusion (OMWI).\1\ Section 342(c)(2) of the Dodd-Frank Act 
requires the OMWI Director to include in the Commission's procedures 
for evaluating contract proposals and hiring service providers a 
written statement that the contractor shall ensure, to the maximum 
extent possible, the fair inclusion of women and minorities in the 
workforce of the contractor and, as applicable, subcontractors. To 
implement the acquisition-specific requirements of Section 342(c)(2) of 
the Dodd-Frank Act, the Commission adopted a Contract Standard for 
Contractor Workforce Inclusion (Contract Standard).
---------------------------------------------------------------------------

    \1\ 12 U.S.C. 5452.
---------------------------------------------------------------------------

    The Contract Standard, which is included in the Commission's 
solicitations and resulting contracts for services with a dollar value 
of $100,000 or more, contains a ``collection of information'' within 
the meaning of the Paperwork Reduction Act. The Contract Standard 
requires that a Commission contractor with 50 or more employees provide 
documentation, upon request from the OMWI Director, to demonstrate that 
it has made good faith efforts to ensure the fair inclusion of 
minorities and women in its workforce and, as applicable, to 
demonstrate its covered subcontractors have made such good faith 
efforts. The documentation requested may include, but is not limited 
to: (1) the total number of employees in the contractor's workforce, 
and the number of employees by race, ethnicity, gender, and job title 
or EEO-1 job category (e.g., EEO-1 Report(s)); (2) a list of covered 
subcontract awards under the contract that includes the dollar amount 
of each subcontract, date of award, and the subcontractor's race, 
ethnicity, and/or gender ownership status; (3) the contractor's plan to 
ensure the fair inclusion of minorities and women in its workforce, 
including outreach efforts; and (4) for each covered subcontractor, the 
information requested in items 1 and 3 above. The OMWI Director will 
consider the information submitted in evaluating whether the contractor 
or subcontractor has complied with its obligations under the Contract 
Standard.
    The information collection is mandatory.
    Title of Collection: Contract Standard for Contractor Workforce 
Inclusion.
    Type of Review: Extension of an Existing Approved Information 
Collection.
    Frequency of Response: Annually.
    Estimated Number of Respondents: 50.
    Estimated Burden Hours per Respondent: 1 hour.
    Estimated Total Annual Burden Hours: 50. The change in the 
estimated annual burden hours from 925 to 50 is due to a change in 
eligibility criteria for requesting documentation to only those 
contractors with 50 or more employees. This change in eligibility 
criteria eliminated any new recordkeeping burden since contractors with 
50 or more employees are generally subject to the recordkeeping and 
reporting requirements under the regulations implementing Title VII of 
the Civil Rights Act \2\ and Executive Order 11246.

    \2\ 42 U.S.C. 2000e, et seq.

    Request for Comments: The comments submitted in response to this 
notice will be summarized and included in the request for OMB approval. 
All comments will become a matter of public record. Written comments 
are invited on: (a) whether this collection of information is necessary 
for the proper performance of the functions of the agency, including 
whether the information will have practical utility; (b) the accuracy 
of the agency's estimate of the burden imposed by the collection of 
information; (c) ways to enhance the quality, utility, and clarity of 
the information collected; and (d) ways to minimize the burden of the 
collection of information on respondents, including through the use of 
automated collection techniques or other forms of information 
technology. Consideration will be given to comments and suggestions 
submitted in writing 60 days after the date of this publication.
    An agency may not conduct or sponsor, and a person is not required 
to respond to, a collection of information under the PRA unless it 
displays a currently valid OMB control number.
    Please direct your written comments to Austin Gerig, Director/Chief 
Data Officer, Securities and Exchange Commission, c/o Oluwaseun Ajayi, 
100 F Street NE, Washington, DC 20549 or send an email to:
