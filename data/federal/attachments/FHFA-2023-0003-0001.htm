SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION:

I. Community Support Review

    Section 10(g)(1) of the Federal Home Loan Bank Act (Bank Act) 
requires FHFA to promulgate regulations establishing standards of 
community investment or service that Bank members must meet in order to 
maintain access to long-term Bank advances. See 12 U.S.C. 1430(g)(1). 
The regulations promulgated by FHFA must take into account factors such 
as the Bank member's performance under the Community Reinvestment Act 
of 1977 (CRA), 12 U.S.C. 2901 et seq., and the Bank member's record of 
lending to first-time homebuyers. See 12 U.S.C. 1430(g)(2). Pursuant to 
section 10(g) of the Bank Act, FHFA has promulgated a community support 
requirements regulation that establishes standards and criteria a Bank 
member must meet in order to maintain access to long-term Bank advances 
and establishes review criteria FHFA must apply in evaluating a 
member's community support performance. See 12 CFR part 1290. The 
regulation includes standards and criteria for the two statutory 
factors--members' CRA performance and members' record of lending to 
first-time homebuyers. 12 CFR 1290.3. Only members subject to the CRA 
must meet the CRA standard. 12 CFR 1290.3(b). All members subject to 
community support review, including those not subject to the CRA, must 
meet the first-time homebuyer standard. 12 CFR 1290.3(c). Members that 
have been certified as community development financial institutions 
(CDFIs) are deemed to be in compliance with the community support 
requirements and are not subject to periodic community support review, 
unless the CDFI member is also an insured depository institution or a 
CDFI credit union. 12 CFR 1290.2(d). In addition, FHFA will not review 
an institution's community support performance until it has been a Bank 
member for at least one year. 12 CFR 1290.2(e).
    Under the regulation, FHFA reviews each applicable member once 
every two years. Starting April 3, 2023, each member that is subject to 
community support review will be required to submit a completed 
Community Support Statement to FHFA. All Community Support Statements 
for this review cycle must be submitted by October 31, 2023. FHFA will 
review the community support performance of each member after receiving 
the member's completed Community Support Statement.

II. Public Comments

    FHFA encourages the public to submit comments by March 24, 2023, on 
the community support performance of Bank members subject to community 
support review. Each Bank is required to post a notice on its public 
website and to notify its Advisory Council, nonprofit housing 
developers, community groups, and other interested parties in its 
district of the opportunity to submit comments on the community support 
programs and activities of Bank members subject to community support 
review, with the name and address of each such member. 12 CFR 
1290.2(c)(1). In reviewing a member for community support compliance, 
FHFA will consider any public comments it has received concerning the 
member. 12 CFR 1290.2(c)(3). To ensure consideration by FHFA, comments 
concerning the community support
