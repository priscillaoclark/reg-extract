I. Self-Regulatory Organization's Statement of the Terms of Substance 
of the Proposed Rule Change

    The Exchange is filing a proposal to amend the MIAX Emerald Fee 
Schedule (the ``Fee Schedule'') to make a clarifying edit.
    The text of the proposed rule change is available on the Exchange's 
website at <a href="https://www.miaxglobal.com/markets/us-options/all-options-exchanges/rule-filings">https://www.miaxglobal.com/markets/us-options/all-options-exchanges/rule-filings</a>, at MIAX Emerald's principal office, and at the 
Commission's Public Reference Room.

II. Self-Regulatory Organization's Statement of the Purpose of, and 
Statutory Basis for, the Proposed Rule Change

    In its filing with the Commission, the Exchange included statements 
concerning the purpose of and basis for the proposed rule change and 
discussed any comments it received on the proposed rule change. The 
text of these statements may be examined at the places specified in 
Item IV below. The Exchange has prepared summaries, set forth in 
sections A, B, and C below, of the most significant aspects of such 
statements.

A. Self-Regulatory Organization's Statement of the Purpose of, and the 
Statutory Basis for, the Proposed Rule Change

1. Purpose
    The Exchange proposes to amend Section 6)d), Historical Market 
Data, of the Fee Schedule to make a clarifying edit. Currently, the 
table in Section 6)d) of the Fee Schedule states that there is a 
monthly fee of $500 for both Members \4\ and Non-Members that request 
such historical market data; however, when the fee was established, the 
intent was to charge a per device fee. In the filing to establish the 
Historical Market Data fee, the Exchange stated that ``[t]he Exchange 
proposed to charge a flat fee of $500 per device requested. Each device 
shall have a maximum storage capacity of 8 terabytes. Users may request 
up to six months of Historical Market Data per device, subject to the 
device's storage capacity.'' \5\ Furthermore, the Exchange's 
affiliates, Miami International Securities Exchange, LLC (``MIAX'') and 
MIAX PEARL, LLC (``MIAX Pearl'') state that the fee for both Members 
and Non-Members is per device.\6\ The Exchange now proposes to make the 
clarifying change to Section 6)d) and change the heading in the table 
from ``Monthly Fee'' to ``Fee Per Device''. The purpose of this 
proposed change is for clarity and uniformity with the fee schedules of 
the Exchange's affiliates, MIAX and MIAX Pearl, and to better reflect 
the original intent of the section. The proposed change will not affect 
the fee charged, it merely seeks to clarify how the fee is charged. The 
Exchange notes that it has charged all historical market data requests 
on a per device basis, as originally intended, and has not charged a 
monthly fee to date.
---------------------------------------------------------------------------

    \4\ The term ``Member'' means an individual or organization 
approved to exercise the trading rights associated with a Trading 
Permit. Members are deemed ``members'' under the Exchange Act. See 
Exchange Rule 100.
    \5\ See Securities Exchange Act Release No. 90738 (December 21, 
2020), 85 FR 85706 (December 29, 2020) (SR-EMERALD-2020-20) (Notice 
of Filing and Immediate Effectiveness of a Proposed Rule Change To 
Amend Its Fee Schedule To Establish a Fee for Historical Market 
Data).
    \6\ See MIAX Fee Schedule, Section 6)d); MIAX Pearl Options Fee 
Schedule, Section 6)c); and MIAX Pearl Equities Fee Schedule, 
Section 3)c).
---------------------------------------------------------------------------

2. Statutory Basis
    The Exchange believes that its proposed rule change is consistent 
with Section 6(b) of the Act \7\ in general, and furthers the 
objectives of Section 6(b)(5) of the Act \8\ in particular, in that it 
is

[[Page 67690]]

designed to prevent fraudulent and manipulative acts and practices, to 
promote just and equitable principles of trade, to foster cooperation 
and coordination with persons engaged in regulating, clearing, 
settling, processing information with respect to, and facilitating 
transactions in, securities, to remove impediments to and perfect the 
mechanisms of a free and open market and a national market system and, 
in general, to protect investors and the public interest.
---------------------------------------------------------------------------

    \7\ 15 U.S.C. 78f(b).
    \8\ 15 U.S.C. 78f(b)(5).
---------------------------------------------------------------------------

    The Exchange believes the proposed changes promote just and 
equitable principles of trade and remove impediments to and perfect the 
mechanism of a free and open market and a national market system 
because the proposed change makes a clarifying edit to the Fee 
Schedule. The Exchange believes that the proposed change will provide 
greater clarity to Members and the public regarding the Exchange's Fee 
Schedule and that it is in the public interest for the Fee Schedule to 
be accurate and clear so as to eliminate the potential for confusion.

B. Self-Regulatory Organization's Statement on Burden on Competition

    The Exchange does not believe that the proposed rule change will 
result in any burden on competition that is not necessary or 
appropriate in furtherance of the purposes of the Act. The proposed 
rule change is not a competitive filing but rather is designed to 
provide added clarity to the Fee Schedule in order to avoid potential 
confusion on the part of market participants. In addition, the Exchange 
does not believe the proposal will impose any burden on inter-market 
competition as the proposal does not address any competitive issues and 
is intended to protect investors by providing further transparency 
regarding the Exchange's Fee Schedule.

C. Self-Regulatory Organization's Statement on Comments on the Proposed 
Rule Change Received From Members, Participants, or Others

    Written comments were neither solicited nor received.

III. Date of Effectiveness of the Proposed Rule Change and Timing for 
Commission Action

    The foregoing rule change has become effective pursuant to Section 
19(b)(3)(A)(ii) of the Act.\9\
---------------------------------------------------------------------------

    \9\ 15 U.S.C. 78s(b)(3)(A)(ii).
---------------------------------------------------------------------------

    At any time within 60 days of the filing of the proposed rule 
change, the Commission summarily may temporarily suspend such rule 
change if it appears to the Commission that such action is: (i) 
necessary or appropriate in the public interest; (ii) for the 
protection of investors; or (iii) otherwise in furtherance of the 
purposes of the Act. If the Commission takes such action, the 
Commission shall institute proceedings to determine whether the 
proposed rule should be approved or disapproved.
