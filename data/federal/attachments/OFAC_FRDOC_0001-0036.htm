SUMMARY: The Office of Foreign Assets Control of the U.S. Department of

Terrorist Organizations Sanctions Regulations to expand the scope of a 
statement of licensing policy concerning payment for certain legal 
services.

Background

    OFAC administers three sanctions programs with respect to 
terrorists and terrorist organizations. The Terrorism Sanctions 
Regulations, 31 CFR part 595 (``TSR''), implement Executive Order 12947 
of January 23, 1995, in which the President declared a national 
emergency with respect to ``grave acts of violence committed by foreign 
terrorists that disrupt the Middle East peace process * * *. '' The 
Global Terrorism Sanctions Regulations, 31 CFR part 594 (``GTSR''), 
implement Executive Order 13224 of September 23, 2001, in which the 
President declared an emergency

[[Page 78632]]

more generally with respect to ``grave acts of terrorism and threats of 
terrorism committed by foreign terrorists * * *.'' The Foreign 
Terrorist Organizations Sanctions Regulations, 31 CFR part 597 
(``FTOSR''), implement provisions of the Antiterrorism and Effective 
Death Penalty Act of 1996.
    OFAC is revising sections in the GTSR and the TSR that authorize 
the provision of specified legal services. Section 594.506 of the GTSR 
and Sec.  595.506 of the TSR authorize U.S. persons to provide certain 
specified legal services to or on behalf of persons whose assets are 
blocked under those regulations, provided that any payment of 
professional fees and reimbursement of incurred expenses must be 
specifically licensed. OFAC is expanding the scope of these general 
licenses by adding to the specified legal services the representation 
of persons detained within the jurisdiction of the United States or by 
the U.S. government with respect to either such detention or any 
charges made against such persons. The general licenses also authorize 
the initiation and conduct of proceedings. OFAC has long had in place 
general licenses that authorize the provision of specified legal 
services on behalf of blocked persons and payment for those services 
when specifically licensed. OFAC is expanding these categories to cover 
this additional factual situation in the GTSR and the TSR, as well as 
related changes in the FTOSR discussed below. OFAC also is making non-
substantive revisions to Sec.  595.506 of the TSR in order to conform 
it to parallel Sec.  594.506 of the GTSR. As a result, OFAC is 
reissuing Sec.  595.506 in its entirety.
    In addition, OFAC is amending Sec.  597.505 of the FTOSR, which 
states that specific licenses may be issued, on a case-by-case basis, 
authorizing payment of professional fees and reimbursement of incurred 
expenses through a U.S. financial institution for certain specified 
legal services by U.S. persons. OFAC is amending this statement of 
licensing policy to add to the list of services for which payment may 
be specifically licensed the representation of agents of foreign 
terrorist organizations detained within the jurisdiction of the United 
States or by the U.S. government, including, but not limited to, the 
conduct of military commission prosecutions and the initiation and 
conduct of federal court proceedings.
    These amendments are not intended to, and do not, imply or create 
any substantive right or cause of action against the United States, its 
officers or employees, or any other person.

Public Participation

    Because the amendments of 31 CFR parts 594, 595, and 597 involve a 
foreign affairs function, Executive Order 12866 and the provisions of 
the Administrative Procedure Act (5 U.S.C. 553) requiring notice of 
proposed rulemaking, opportunity for public participation, and delay in 
effective date, are inapplicable. Because no notice of proposed 
rulemaking is required for this rule, the Regulatory Flexibility Act (5 
U.S.C. 601-612) does not apply.

Paperwork Reduction Act

    The collections of information related to 31 CFR parts 594, 595, 
and 597 are contained in 31 CFR part 501 (the ``Reporting, Procedures 
and Penalties Regulations''). Pursuant to the Paperwork Reduction Act 
of 1995 (44 U.S.C. 3507), those collections of information have been 
approved by the Office of Management and Budget under control number 
1505-0164. An agency may not conduct or sponsor, and a person is not 
required to respond to, a collection of information unless the 
collection of information displays a valid control number.
