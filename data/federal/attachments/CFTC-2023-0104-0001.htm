SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION: 
    Title: Customer Clearing Documentation and Timing of Acceptance for 
Clearing (OMB Control No. 3038-0092). This is a request for extension 
of a currently approved information collection.
    Abstract: Section 4d(c) of the Commodity Exchange Act (``CEA''), as 
amended by the Dodd-Frank Wall Street Reform and Consumer Protection 
Act (``Dodd-Frank Act''), directs the Commission to require futures 
commission merchants (``FCMs'') to implement conflict of interest 
procedures that address such issues as the Commission determines to be 
appropriate. Similarly, section 4s(j)(5) of the CEA, as added by the 
Dodd-Frank Act, requires swap dealers (``SDs'') and major swap 
participants (``MSPs'') to

[[Page 77563]]

implement conflict of interest procedures that address such issues as 
the Commission determines to be appropriate. Section 4s(j)(5) also 
requires SDs and MSPs to ensure that any persons providing clearing 
activities or making determinations as to accepting clearing customers 
are separated by appropriate informational partitions from persons 
whose involvement in pricing, trading, or clearing activities might 
bias their judgment or contravene the core principle of open access. 
Section 4s(j)(6) of the CEA prohibits a SD or MSP from adopting any 
process or taking any action that results in any unreasonable restraint 
on trade or imposes any material anticompetitive burden on trading or 
clearing, unless necessary or appropriate to achieve the purposes of 
the Act. Section 2(h)(1)(B)(ii) of the CEA requires that derivatives 
clearing organization (``DCO'') rules provide for the nondiscriminatory 
clearing of swaps executed bilaterally or through an unaffiliated 
designated contract market or swap execution facility.
    To address these provisions, the Commission promulgated regulations 
that prohibit arrangements involving FCMs, SDs, MSPs, and DCOs that 
would (a) disclose to an FCM, SD, or MSP the identity of a customer's 
original executing counterparty (Sec. Sec.  1.72(a), 23.608(a), and 
39.12(a)(1)(vi)); (b) limit the number of counterparties with whom a 
customer may enter into a trade (Sec. Sec.  1.72(b), 23.608(b), and 
39.12(a)(1)(vi)); (c) restrict the size of the position a customer may 
take with any individual counterparty, apart from an overall credit 
limit for all positions held by the customer at the FCM (Sec. Sec.  
1.72(c), 23.608(c), and 39.12(a)(1)(vi)); (d) impair a customer's 
access to execution of a trade on terms that have a reasonable 
relationship to the best terms available (Sec. Sec.  1.72(d), 
23.608(d), and 39.12(a)(1)(vi)); or (e) prevent compliance with 
specified time frames for acceptance of trades into clearing set forth 
in 1.74(b), 23.610(b), or 39.12(b)(7) (Sec. Sec.  1.72(e), 23.608(e), 
and 39.12(a)(1)(vi)). Additionally, the Commission requires, through 
regulation 39.12(b)(7)(i)(B), DCOs to coordinate with clearing members 
to establish prompt processing of trades. Regulations 1.74(a) and 
23.610(a) require reciprocal coordination by FCMs, SDs, and MSPs that 
are clearing members.
    Under the above regulations, SDs, MSPs, FCMs, and DCOs are required 
to develop and maintain written customer clearing documentation and 
trade processing procedures. Maintenance of contracts, policies, and 
procedures is prudent business practice. All SDs, MSPs, FCMs, and DCOs 
maintain documentation consistent with these regulations. The 
regulations are crucial both for effective risk management and for the 
efficient operation of trading venues among SDs, MSPs, FCMs, and DCOs. 
Each of these entities has a general recordkeeping obligation for these 
requirements under the Commission's regulations (Sec.  39.20 for DCOs; 
Sec.  23.606 for SDs and MSPs; and Sec.  1.73 for FCMs).
    The information collection burden arising from the regulations 
primarily is restricted to the costs associated with the affected 
registrants' obligation to maintain records related to clearing 
documentation between the customer and the customer's clearing member, 
and trade processing procedures between DCOs and FCMs, SDs, and MSPs. 
The information collection obligations are necessary to implement 
certain provisions of the CEA, including ensuring that registrants 
exercise effective risk management, and are also appropriate for the 
efficient operation of trading venues among SDs, MSPs, FCMs, and DCOs.
    An agency may not conduct or sponsor, and a person is not required 
to respond to, a collection of information unless it displays a 
currently valid OMB control number.\2\ On August 25, 2023, the 
Commission published in the Federal Register notice of the proposed 
extension of this information collection and provided 60 days for 
public comment on the proposed extension, 88 FR 58251 (``60-Day 
Notice''). The Commission did not receive any comments on the 60-Day 
Notice.
