Final Approval Under OMB Delegated Authority of the Extension for Three 
Years, With Revision, of the Following Information Collections

    Collection title: Financial Statements for Holding Companies.
    Collection identifier: FR Y-9C, FR Y-9LP, FR Y-9SP, FR Y-9ES, and 
FR Y-9CS.
    OMB control number: 7100-0128.
    General description of collection: The Board requires bank holding 
companies, most savings and loan holding companies, securities holding 
companies, and U.S. intermediate holding companies (collectively, HCs) 
to provide standardized financial statements through one or more of the 
FR Y-9 reports. The information collected on the FR Y-9 reports is 
necessary for the Board to identify emerging financial risks and 
monitor the safety and soundness of HC operations.
    The Consolidated Financial Statements for Holding Companies (FR Y-
9C) consists of standardized financial statements for HCs similar to 
the Call Reports filed by commercial banks. The FR Y-9C collects 
consolidated data and is filed quarterly by top-tier HCs with total 
consolidated assets of $3 billion or more.
    The Parent Company Only Financial Statements for Large Holding 
Companies (FR Y-9LP), must be submitted quarterly by each HC that files 
the FR Y-9C, as well as by each of its subsidiary HCs. The report 
consists of standardized financial statements, including the following 
schedules: Income Statement, Cash Flow Statement, Balance Sheet, 
Investments in Subsidiaries and Associated Companies, Memoranda, and 
Notes to the Parent Company Only Financial Statements.
    The Parent Company Only Financial Statements for Small Holding 
Companies (FR Y-9SP), is filed semiannually by HCs with total 
consolidated assets of less than $3 billion. In a banking organization 
with total consolidated assets of less than $3 billion that has tiered 
HCs, each HC in the organization must submit, or have the top-tier HC 
submit on its behalf, a separate FR Y-9SP. This report collects basic 
balance sheet and income data for the parent company, as well as data 
on its intangible assets and intercompany transactions.
    The Financial Statements for Employee Stock Ownership Plan Holding 
Companies (FR Y-9ES) is filed annually by each employee stock ownership 
plan (ESOP) that is also an HC. The report collects financial data on 
the ESOP's benefit plan activities. The FR Y-9ES consists of four 
schedules: Statement of Changes in Net Assets Available for Benefits, 
Statement of Net Assets Available for Benefits, Memoranda, and Notes to 
the Financial Statements.
    The instructions to each of the FR Y-9C, FR Y-9LP, FR Y-9SP, and FR 
Y-9ES state that respondent HCs should retain workpapers and other 
records used in the preparation of the reports for a period of three 
years following submission. In addition, HCs must maintain in their 
files a manually signed and attested printout of the data submitted 
under each form for a period of three years.
    The Supplement to the Consolidated Financial Statements for Holding 
Companies (FR Y-9CS) is a voluntary, free-form supplemental report that 
the Board may utilize to collect critical additional data deemed to be 
needed from HCs in an expedited manner. The FR Y-9CS data collections 
are used to assess and monitor emerging issues related to HCs, and the 
report is intended to supplement the other FR Y-9 reports. The data 
requested by the FR Y-9CS would depend on the Board's data needs in any 
given situation. For example, changes made by the Financial Accounting 
Standards Board may introduce into generally accepted accounting 
principles new data items that are not currently collected by the other 
FR Y-9 reports. The Board could use the FR Y-9CS report to collect 
these data until the items are implemented into the other FR Y-9 
reports.
    Frequency: Quarterly, semiannual, annual, and as needed.
    Respondents: HCs.
    Total estimated number of respondents:

    Collection title: Consolidated Report of Condition and Income for 
Edge and Agreement Corporations.
    Collection identifier: FR 2886b.
    OMB control number: 7100-0086.
    General description of collection: The FR 2886b reporting form is 
filed quarterly or annually by Edge and agreement corporations 
(collectively, Edges or Edge corporations). The Board is responsible 
for authorizing, supervising, and assigning ratings to Edges. The Board 
and the Federal Reserve Banks use the data collected by the FR 2886b to 
supervise Edge corporations and to monitor and develop a better 
understanding of Edge activities.

    Current actions: On June 7, 2024, the Board published two separate 
initial notices in the Federal Register (89 FR 48637 and 89 FR 48655) 
requesting

[[Page 90286]]

public comment for 60 days on the extension, with revision, of the FR 
Y-9 and FR 2886b. The comment period for both notices expired on August 
6, 2024, and the Board received one comment letter. After considering 
the comments received on the proposal, the Board is proceeding with the 
revisions to the FR Y-9C, FR Y-9LP, and FR 2886b as proposed.

Detailed Discussion of Public Comments

1. ASU 2022-02, ``Financial Instruments-Credit Losses (Topic): Troubled 
Debt Restructurings and Vintage Disclosures''

    The commenter is supportive of the proposed revisions to align the 
regulatory reporting of loan modifications to borrowers experiencing 
financial difficulty (LMBEFD) on the FR Y-9C, FR Y-9LP, and FR 2886b in 
accordance with ASU 2022-02. The commenter noted that, in any event, 
the Board should not modify the proposed FR Y-9 revisions to bring the 
reporting in line with the outstanding proposal on the Call Reports.\1\ 
The commenter urged the Board to implement ASU 2022-02 across all 
regulatory reporting forms, including the Consolidated Reports of 
Condition and Income (Call Reports) (FFIEC 031, FFIEC 041, and FFIEC 
051). The commenter stated that aligning all regulatory reports with 
ASU 2022-02 would align with current practices by banking organizations 
and would reduce burden by eliminating the necessity to develop and 
maintain dual processes.
---------------------------------------------------------------------------

    \1\ See 89 FR 45046 (May 22, 2024).
---------------------------------------------------------------------------

    In response, the Board is proceeding with these revisions as 
proposed to the FR Y-9C, FR Y-9LP, and FR 2886b. Additionally, on June 
7, 2024, the Board published in the Federal Register separate initial 
notices that invited comment for 60 days on the extension, with 
revision, of the Financial Statements of U.S. Nonbank Subsidiaries Held 
by Foreign Banking Organization (FR Y-7N),\2\ Financial Statements of 
Foreign Subsidiaries of U.S. Banking Organizations (FR 2314),\3\ and 
Financial Statements of U.S. Nonbank Subsidiaries of U.S. Holding 
Companies (FR Y-11) to propose aligning the reporting of LMBEFD with 
ASU 2022-02. Additionally, on June 21, 2024, the Board published in the 
Federal Register an initial notice that invited comment for 60 days on 
the extension, with revision, of the Capital Assessments and Stress 
Testing Reports (FR Y-14A/Q/M),\4\ to also propose aligning the 
reporting of LMBEFD with ASU 2022-02. Separate from this notice, the 
Board may also finalize the FR Y-7N, FR 2314, FR Y-11, and FR Y-14A/Q/M 
notices to align with ASU 2022-02, after the comment period has 
expired.
---------------------------------------------------------------------------

    \2\ See 89 FR 48641 (June 7, 2024).
    \3\ See 89 FR 48639 (June 7, 2024).
    \4\ See 89 FR 52042 (June 21, 2024).
---------------------------------------------------------------------------

    With regard to aligning the reporting of LMBEFD in accordance with 
ASU 2022-02 on the Call Report, the Office of the Comptroller of the 
Currency (OCC), Treasury; Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation (FDIC); 
and Board (collectively, the agencies) are continuing to evaluate the 
comments on their September 2023 proposal,\5\ as well, as the comments 
received on this proposal. Upon conclusion of their review, the 
agencies will adopt a standard through a subsequent Paperwork Reduction 
Act (PRA) notice with a public comment period.
---------------------------------------------------------------------------

    \5\ See 88 FR 66933 (September 28, 2023).
---------------------------------------------------------------------------

    The commenter stated that the FR Y-9C's definition of LMBEFDs 
should align with the U.S. GAAP definition, specifically Accounting 
Standards Codification (ASC) Subtopic 310-10 and not scope in any 
additional modifications. The commenter noted that ASC Subtopic 310-10 
requires disclosure of modifications of receivables to borrowers 
experiencing financial difficulty where the modification results in the 
form of (1) principal forgiveness, (2) an interest rate reduction, (3) 
an other-than-insignificant payment delay, or (4) a term extension (or 
a combination thereof) to be disclosed for financial reporting 
purposes. The commenter mentioned that it would be helpful if the Board 
would explicitly confirm the definitional alignment with U.S GAAP and 
therefore limit the population of LMBEFD for regulatory reporting 
purposes to those four modifications. In response to the commenter, the 
four modifications referenced from ASC Subtopic 310-10 are explicitly 
included in the FR Y-9Cs definition of LMBEFD and therefore limits the 
population of LMBEFD accordingly.

2. Other Comments Received

    The Board also received comments that were not specifically related 
to the proposed changes in this proposal. The commenter recommended 
that the Board should propose and implement changes to the reporting of 
loans to nondepository institutions (NDFIs) and nonpurpose margin loans 
on the FR Y-9C to be consistent with the recently finalized Call Report 
proposal.\6\ The commenter also recommended that any changes to the 
definition of `Past Due' should be aligned and implemented concurrently 
between the FR Y-9, FR 2886b, and the Call Reports.
---------------------------------------------------------------------------

    \6\ See 89 FR 45046 (May 22, 2024).
---------------------------------------------------------------------------

    In response, the Board may propose and implement revisions to the 
FR Y-9C related to the reporting of NDFI loans and nonpurpose margin 
loans that would be consistent with the finalized Call Report proposal. 
Additionally, the Board may also propose changes related to the 
definition of ``Past Due'' in the FR Y-9 and FR 2886b that would be 
aligned and implemented concurrent with the Call Reports. Any future 
changes to the FR Y-9C and FR 2886b related to the reporting of NDFI 
loans, nonpurpose margin loans, and the definition of ``Past Due'' 
would be subject to the PRA notice and comment process.
