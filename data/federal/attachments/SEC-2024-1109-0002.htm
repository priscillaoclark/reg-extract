SECURITIES AND EXCHANGE COMMISSION

[SEC File No. 270-659, OMB Control No. 3235-0723]


Submission for OMB Review; Comment Request; Extension: Form 1-Z

Upon Written Request Copies Available From: Securities and Exchange 
Commission, Office of FOIA Services, 100 F Street NE, Washington, DC 
20549-2736.

    Notice is hereby given that, pursuant to the Paperwork Reduction 
Act of 1995 (44 U.S.C. 3501 et seq.), the Securities and Exchange 
Commission (``Commission'') has submitted to the Office of Management 
and Budget this request for extension of the previously approved 
collection of information discussed below.
    Form 1-Z (17 CFR 239.94) is used to report terminated or completed 
offerings or to suspend the duty to file ongoing reports under 
Regulation A, an exemption from registration under the Securities Act 
of 1933 (15 U.S.C 77a et seq.). The purpose of the Form 1-Z is to 
collect empirical data for the Commission on offerings conducted under 
Regulation A that have terminated or completed, to indicate to the 
Commission that issuers that have conducted Tier 2 offering are 
suspending their duty to file reports under Regulation A and to provide 
such information to the investing public. We estimate that 
approximately 51 issuers file Form 1-Z annually. We estimate that Form 
1-Z takes approximately 1.5 hours to prepare. We estimate that 100% of 
the 1.5 hours per response is prepared by the company for a total 
annual burden of 77 hours (1.5 hours per response x 51 responses).
    An agency may not conduct or sponsor, and a person is not required 
to respond to, a collection of information unless it displays a 
currently valid control number.
    Public Comment Instructions: The 30-day public comment period for 
this information collection request opens on December 12, 2024 and 
closes at the end of the day on January 13, 2025. The public may view 
the full information
