Proposal Under OMB Delegated Authority To Extend for Three Years, With 
Revision, the Following Information Collection

    Collection title: Treasury Securities and Agency Debt and Mortgage-
Backed Securities Reporting Requirements.
    Collection identifier: FR 2956.
    OMB control number: 7100-0383.
    General description of collection: The FR 2956 collects detailed 
data on depository institutions' daily transactions trading of 
marketable U.S. Treasury securities and transactions trading of the 
debt and mortgage-backed securities (MBS) issued by U.S. federal 
government agencies including government-sponsored enterprises 
(agencies). The 2956 has two parts: Part 1 collects data on 
transactions in U.S. Treasury debt, and Part 2 collects transactions in 
debt and MBS issued by agencies. Every national bank, state member 
bank, state non-member bank, savings association, or U.S. branch and 
agency of a foreign bank filing a Notice by Financial Institutions of 
Government Securities Broker or Government Securities Dealer Activities 
(Form G-FIN; OMB No. 7100-0224) with average daily transaction volumes 
of over $100 million, for U.S. Treasury debt, or over $50 million, for 
agency-issued debt and MBS, during the prior fiscal year is subject to 
the these reporting requirements. Depository institutions subject to 
the reporting requirements of the FR 2956 electronically report 
transactions through the Board's data collection vendor, the Financial 
Industry Regulatory Authority (FINRA), utilizing its Trade Reporting 
and Compliance Engine (TRACE). Broker-dealers that are members of FINRA 
report transactions pursuant to the FINRA rules, and not the FR 2956. 
The Board receives data on transactions executed by FINRA members.
    Proposed revisions: The Board proposes to revise Part 1 of the FR 
2956 report, which pertains to the reporting of transactions in U.S. 
Treasury securities, by updating (i) the timeframe within which a 
depository institution

[[Page 54463]]

subject to the reporting requirements of Part 1 of the FR 2956 must 
report transactions in U.S. Treasury securities, and (ii) for 
transactions executed electronically, the minimum increment of time 
that must be used for reporting the execution times. The Board also 
proposes certain technical and clarifying revisions to Part 2 of the FR 
2956 report. Specifically, the revisions are intended to make the 
definitions clearer and to correct an error.
    Frequency: Daily, event-generated.
    Respondents: Depository institutions that meet the above reporting 
thresholds. Prime brokers or depository institutions who file Form G-
FIN and are FINRA members acting as an executing broker and that 
therefore already are subject to TRACE reporting pursuant to FINRA 
rules are exempt from this reporting requirement.
    Total estimated number of respondents: 22.
    Total estimated change in burden: (11,000).
    Total estimated annual burden hours: 22,000.

    Board of Governors of the Federal Reserve System, June 25, 2024.
Benjamin W. McDonough,
Deputy Secretary and Ombuds of the Board.
