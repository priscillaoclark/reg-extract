Control No. 3038-0099.

SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION: 
    Title: Process for a Swap Execution Facility or Designated Contract 
Market to Make a Swap Available to Trade (OMB Control No. 3038-0099). 
This is a request for extension of a currently approved information 
collection.
    Abstract: The collection of information is needed to help determine 
which swaps should be subject to the trade execution requirement under 
section 2(h)(8) of the Commodity Exchange Act pursuant to section 723 
of the Dodd-Frank Wall Street Reform and Consumer Protection Act. A SEF 
or DCM that submits a determination that a swap is available to trade 
must address at least one of several factors to demonstrate that the 
swap is suitable for trading pursuant to the trade execution 
requirement. The Commission uses the collection of information to 
facilitate the application of the trade execution requirement and the 
requirements associated with methods of execution under parts 37 and 38 
of the Commission's regulations.
    An agency may not conduct or sponsor, and a person is not required 
to respond to, a collection of information unless it displays a 
currently valid OMB control number. On July 13, 2022, the Commission 
published in the Federal Register notice of the proposed extension of 
this information collection and provided 60 days for public comment on 
the proposed extension, 87 FR 41674 (60-Day Notice). The Commission did 
not receive any substantive comments on the 60-Day Notice.
    Burden Statement: The Commission estimates the burden of reviewing 
the prescribed factors and data to make a determination for this 
collection to be 16 hours per response.
    Respondents/Affected Entities: SEFs, DCMs.
    Estimated Number of Respondents: 5.
    Estimated Average Burden Hours per Respondent: 16.
    Estimated Total Annual Burden Hours: 80.
    Frequency of Collection: On occasion.
    There are no capital costs or operating and maintenance costs 
associated with this collection.

(Authority: 44 U.S.C. 3501 et seq.)

    Dated: September 16, 2022.
Robert Sidman,
Deputy Secretary of the Commission.
