SECURITIES AND EXCHANGE COMMISSION

[SEC File No. 270-336, OMB Control No. 3235-0379]


Proposed Collection; Comment Request; Extension: Form F-X

Upon Written Request Copies Available From: Securities and Exchange 
Commission, Office of FOIA Services, 100 F Street NE, Washington, DC 
20549-2736

    Notice is hereby given that, pursuant to the Paperwork Reduction 
Act of 1995 (44 U.S.C. 3501 et seq.), the Securities and Exchange 
Commission (``Commission'') is soliciting comments on the collection of 
information summarized below. The Commission plans to submit this 
existing collection of information to the Office of Management and 
Budget for extension and Form F-X (17 CFR 239.42) is used to appoint an 
agent for service of process by Canadian issuers registering securities 
on Forms F-7, F-8, F-9, or F-10 under the Securities Act of 1933 (15 
U.S.C. 77a et seq.) or filing periodic reports on Form 40-F under the 
Exchange Act of 1934 (15 U.S.C. 78a et seq.). The information collected 
must be filed with the Commission and is publicly available. We 
estimate that it takes approximately 2 hours per response to prepare 
Form F-X and that the information is filed by approximately 114 
respondents for a total annual reporting burden of 228 hours (2 hours 
per response x 114 responses).
    Written comments are invited on: (a) whether this proposed 
collection of information is necessary for the proper performance of 
the functions of the agency, including whether the information will 
have practical utility; (b) the accuracy of the agency's estimate of 
the burden imposed by the collection of information; (c) ways to 
enhance the quality, utility, and clarity of the information collected; 
and (d) ways to minimize the burden of the collection of information on 
respondents, including through the use of automated collection

techniques or other forms of information technology. Consideration will 
be given to comments and suggestions submitted in writing within 60 
days of this publication by November 18, 2024.
    An agency may not conduct or sponsor, and a person is not required 
to respond to, a collection of information unless it displays a 
currently valid control number.
    Please direct your written comment to Austin Gerig, Director/Chief 
Data Officer, Securities and Exchange Commission, c/o Oluwaseun Ajayi, 
100 F Street NE, Washington, DC 20549 or send an email to:
