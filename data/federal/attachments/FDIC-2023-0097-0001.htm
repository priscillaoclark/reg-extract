    General Description of Collection: Regulation M (12 CFR 1013), 
issued by the Bureau of Consumer Financial Protection, implements the 
consumer leasing provisions of the Truth in Lending Act. Regulation M 
requires lessors of personal property to provide consumers with 
meaningful disclosures about the costs and terms of the leases for 
personal property. Lessors are required to retain evidence of 
compliance with Regulation M for twenty-four months. There is no change 
in the methodology or substance of this information collection. The 
change in burden is due solely to the decrease in the estimated number 
of respondents from 19 in 2021 to 17.
    2. Title: Retail Foreign Exchange Transactions.
    OMB Number: 3064-0182.
    Forms: None.

    General Description of Collection: This information collection 
implements section 742(c)(2) of the Dodd-Frank Act (7 U.S.C. 
2(c)(2)(E)) and FDIC regulations governing retail foreign exchange 
transactions as set forth at 12 CFR part 349, subpart B. The regulation 
allows banking organizations under FDIC supervision to engage in off-
exchange transactions in foreign currency with retail customers 
provided they comply with various reporting, recordkeeping and third-
party disclosure requirements specified in the rule. If an institution 
elects to conduct such transactions, compliance with the information 
collection is mandatory. Reporting Requirements--part 349, subpart B 
requires that, prior to initiating a retail foreign exchange business; 
a banking institution must provide the FDIC with a notice certifying 
that the institution has written policies and procedures, and risk 
measurement and management systems and controls in place to ensure that 
retail foreign exchange transactions are conducted in a safe and sound 
manner. The institution must also provide information about how it 
intends to manage customer due diligence, new product approvals and 
haircuts applied to noncash margin. Recordkeeping Requirements--part 
349 subpart B requires that institutions engaging in retail foreign 
exchange transactions keep full, complete and systematic records of 
account, financial ledger, transaction, memorandum orders and post 
execution allocations of bunched orders. In addition, institutions are 
required to maintain records regarding their ratio of profitable 
accounts, possible violations of law, records of noncash margin and 
monthly statements and confirmations issued. Disclosure Requirements--
The regulation requires that, before opening an account that will 
engage in retail foreign exchange transactions, a banking institution 
must obtain from each retail foreign exchange customer an 
acknowledgement of receipt and understanding of a written disclosure 
specified in the rule and of disclosures about the banking 
institution's fees and other charges and of its profitable accounts 
ratio. The institution must also provide monthly statements to each 
retail foreign exchange customer and must send confirmation statements 
following every transaction. The customer dispute resolution provisions 
of the regulation require certain endorsements, acknowledgements and 
signature language as well as the timely provision of a list of persons 
qualified to handle a customer's request for arbitration.
    After reviewing the requirements in subpart B and the similar ICRs 
currently approved by OMB for the OCC and the Federal Reserve, the FDIC 
has determined that subpart B imposes more recordkeeping requirements 
than those listed in the 2021 ICR. While the 2021 ICR listed 12 CFR 
349.19 as the only recordkeeping requirement in subpart B,\1\ the FDIC 
notes that the requirement in 12 CFR 349.21(b)(2) \2\ also meets the 
definition of a recordkeeping requirement, as does the requirement in 
12 CFR 349.25(a).\3\ The OCC and the

[[Page 88615]]

Federal Reserve each listed requirements that are analogous to those in 
12 CFR 349.21(b)(2) and 12 CFR 349.25(a) as recordkeeping requirements 
in their similar ICRs,\4\ in addition to recordkeeping requirements 
that are analogous to those in 12 CFR 349.19.\5\ The FDIC is revising 
its information collection to include this burden.
---------------------------------------------------------------------------

    \1\ See footnote 7.
    \2\ 12 CFR 349.21(b)(2) requires FDIC-supervised institutions 
that are engaged in, or that offer to engage in, retail foreign 
exchange transactions to establish written policies and procedures 
that include: Haircuts for noncash margin collected pursuant to 12 
CFR 349.21 (12 CFR 349.21(b)(2)(i)), and annual evaluation and, if 
appropriate, modification of the haircuts (12 CFR 349.21(b)(2)(ii)).
    \3\ 12 CFR 349.25(a)(1) requires FDIC-supervised institutions 
that are engaged in retail foreign exchange transactions to 
establish and implement internal policies, procedures, and controls 
designed to ensure that orders placed for retail foreign exchange 
transactions by retail foreign exchange customers are given priority 
over orders placed for retail foreign exchange transactions for a 
proprietary account of the FDIC-supervised institution (12 CFR 
349.25(a)(1)(i)), or an account in which a related person has an 
interest (12 CFR 349.25(a)(1)(ii), (iii), and (iv)). 12 CFR 349.14 
defines ``related person'' as: (1) Any general partner, officer, 
director, or owner of ten percent or more of the capital stock of 
the FDIC-supervised insured depository institution; (2) An 
associated person or employee of the retail foreign exchange 
counterparty, if the retail foreign exchange counterparty is not an 
FDIC-supervised insured depository institution; (3) An institution-
affiliated party, as that term is defined in 12 U.S.C. 1813(u)(1), 
(2), or (3), or employee of the retail foreign exchange 
counterparty, if the retail foreign exchange counterparty is not an 
FDIC-supervised insured depository institution, or; (4) And relative 
or spouse of any of the foregoing persons, or any relative of such 
spouse, who shares the same home as any of the foregoing persons. 12 
CFR 349.25(a)(2) requires FDIC-supervised institutions that are 
engaged in retail foreign exchange transactions to establish and 
implement internal policies, procedures, and controls designed to 
prevent FDIC-supervised insured depository institution related 
persons from placing orders, directly or indirectly, with another 
person in a manner designed to circumvent the provisions of 12 CFR 
349.25(a)(1). 12 CFR 349.25(a)(3) requires FDIC-supervised 
institutions that are engaged in retail foreign exchange 
transactions to establish and implement internal policies, 
procedures, and controls designed to fairly and objectively 
establish settlement prices for retail foreign exchange 
transactions.
    \4\ For the Federal Reserve, these requirements include those in 
12 CFR 240.9(b)(2) and 12 CFR 240.13(a). For the OCC, these 
requirements include those in 12 CFR 48.13 and 12 CFR 48.9.
    \5\ These requirements include the Federal Reserve's regulations 
at 12 CFR 240.7 and the OCC's regulations at 12 CFR 48.7.

    General Description of Collection: The FDIC is requesting renewal 
of this approved collection to use occasional qualitative surveys to 
gather information from the public to inform qualitative research. 
While the subject and nature of the surveys to be deployed under this 
information collection are yet to be determined, based on prior 
experience it is expected that the number or respondents will range 
from a few to, at times, several thousands, but, in general, these 
surveys are expected to involve an average of 500 respondents. 
Likewise, the time to respond to the surveys can range from a few 
minutes to several hours, but it is expected that the average time to 
respond to a survey is approximately one hour. These surveys are 
completely voluntary in nature. FDIC estimates that approximately 20 
such surveys will be conducted in any given year. Currently, the FDIC 
has a variety of methods to collect quantitative information from 
consumers and institutions (e.g., Call Reports, FDIC National Survey of 
Unbanked and Underbanked Households, etc.). Qualitative data would 
provide complementary information on insights, opinions, and 
perceptions that will inform how the FDIC approaches its mission to 
safeguard financial stability of the banking system and promote 
consumer protection and economic inclusion. This clearance would allow 
the FDIC to engage with consumers and other relevant stakeholders 
through qualitative research methods such as focus groups, in-depth 
interviews, cognitive testing, and/or qualitative virtual methods. The 
purpose of the surveys is, in general terms, to obtain anecdotal 
information about regulatory burden, problems or successes in the bank 
supervisory process (including both safety-and-soundness and consumer 
related exams), the perceived need for regulatory or statutory change, 
and similar concerns. The information in these surveys is anecdotal in 
nature, that is, samples are not necessarily random, the results are 
not necessarily representative of a larger class of potential 
respondents, and the goal is not to produce a statistically valid and 
reliable database. Rather, the surveys are expected to yield anecdotal 
information about the particular experiences and opinions of members of 
the public, primarily staff at respondent banks or bank customers. The 
collection is noncontroversial and does not raise issues of concern to 
other Federal agencies; with the exception of information needed to 
provide remuneration for participants of focus groups and cognitive 
laboratory studies, personally identifiable information (PII) is 
collected only to the extent necessary and is not retained. 
Participation in this information collection will be voluntary and 
conducted in-person, by phone, or using other methods, such as virtual 
technology. The types of collections that this generic clearance covers 
include, but are not limited to: Small discussion groups; focus groups 
of consumers, financial industry professionals, or other stakeholders; 
cognitive laboratory studies, such as those used to refine questions or 
assess usability of a website; qualitative customer satisfaction 
surveys (e.g., post- transaction surveys; opt-out web surveys); and in-
person observation testing (e.g., website or software usability tests).
    There is no change in the substance or methodology of this 
information collection.

Request for Comment

    Comments are invited on: (a) Whether the collection of information 
is necessary for the proper performance of the FDIC's functions, 
including whether the information has practical utility; (b) the 
accuracy of the estimates of the burden of the information collection, 
including the validity of the methodology and assumptions used; (c) 
ways to enhance the quality, utility, and clarity of the information to 
be collected; and (d) ways to minimize the burden of the collection of 
information on respondents, including through the use of automated 
collection techniques or other forms of information technology. All 
comments will become a matter of public record.
