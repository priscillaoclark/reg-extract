SECURITIES AND EXCHANGE COMMISSION

[SEC File No. 270-114, OMB Control No. 3235-0102]


Submission for OMB Review; Comment Request; Extension: Tender 
Offer--Regulation 14D and Regulation 14E, Schedule 14D-9

Upon Written Request Copies Available From: Securities and Exchange 
Commission, Office of FOIA Services, 100 F Street NE, Washington, DC 
20549-2736

    Notice is hereby given that, pursuant to the Paperwork Reduction 
Act of 1995 (44 U.S.C. 3501 et seq.), the Securities and Exchange 
Commission (``Commission'') has submitted to the Office of Management 
and Budget this request for extension of the previously approved 
collection of information discussed below.
    Regulation 14D (17 CFR 240.14d-1--240.14d-11) and Regulation 14E 
(17 CFR 240.14e-1--240.14e-8) and related Schedule 14D-9 (17 CFR 
240.14d-101) require information important to security holders in 
deciding how to respond to tender offers. Schedule 14D-9 takes 
approximately 260.56 hours per response to prepare and is filed by 
approximately 63 companies annually. We estimate that 25% of the 260.56 
hours per response (65.14 hours) is prepared by the company for an 
annual reporting burden of 4,104 hours (65.14 hours per response x 63 
responses).
    An agency may not conduct or sponsor, and a person is not required 
to respond to, a collection of information unless it displays a 
currently valid control number.
    The public may not view background documentation for this 
information collection at the following website: <a href="http://www.reginfo.gov">www.reginfo.gov</a>. Find 
this particular information collection by selecting ``Currently under 
30-day Review--Open for Public Comments'' or by using the search

information collection should be sent within 30 days of publication of 
this notice by January 10, 2024 to (i) <a href="http://www.reginfo.gov/public/do/PRAMain">www.reginfo.gov/public/do/PRAMain</a> and (ii) David Bottom, Director/Chief Information Officer, 
Securities and Exchange Commission, c/o John Pezzullo, 100 F Street NE, 
Washington, DC 20549, or by sending an email to: <a href="/cdn-cgi/l/email-protection#3c6c6e7d63715d55505e53447c4f595f125b534a"><span class="__cf_email__" data-cfemail="bceceefde3f1ddd5d0ded3c4fccfd9df92dbd3ca">[email&#160;protected]</span></a>.

    Dated: December 6, 2023.
Sherry R. Haywood,
Assistant Secretary.
