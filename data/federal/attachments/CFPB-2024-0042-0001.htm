CONSUMER FINANCIAL PROTECTION BUREAU

[Docket No: CFPB-2024-0042]


Privacy Act of 1974; System of Records

AGENCY: Consumer Financial Protection Bureau.

ACTION: Notice of a new system of records.

-----------------------------------------------------------------------

SUMMARY: In accordance with the Privacy Act of 1974, the Consumer 
Financial Protection Bureau (CFPB) proposes to modify, rename, and 
reissue a current Privacy Act System of Records titled ``CFPB.002--
Depository Institution Supervision Database.'' In the course of its 
supervisory work, the CFPB collects, uses, and maintains information on 
covered individuals associated with depository institutions (e.g., 
banks, savings associations, credit unions) and non-depository 
institutions (herein collectively referred to as supervised 
institutions), and their affiliates and service providers subject to 
the authority of the CFPB. This SORN

[[Page 73078]]

addresses information collected through the CFPB's supervisory and 
examination authorities under Federal consumer financial law. The CFPB 
is updating the name of this system of records and expanding the scope 
of the categories of individuals and records to account for the 
incorporation of information collected and maintained under another 
system of records, ``CFPB.003--Non-Depository Supervision Database.'' 
Upon publication of this modified System of Records Notice (SORN), the 
CFPB.003--Non-Depository Supervision Database SORN will be rescinded.

system of records will be effective October 9, 2024 unless the comments

SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION: In accordance with the Privacy Act of 1974, 
5. U.S.C. 552a, the CFPB is modifying, renaming, and reissuing a CFPB 
system of records titled, ``CFPB.002--Depository Institution 
Supervision Database,'' to ``CFPB.002--Supervision and Examination 
Records.'' The CFPB update to CFPB.002--Depository Institution 
Supervision Database, now CFPB.002--Supervision and Examination 
Records, includes several changes.
    First, the system of records is being renamed to account for the 
incorporation of information collected and maintained under another 
system of records titled, ``CFPB.003--Non-Depository Supervision 
Database,'' and better align with the purpose(s) of the system(s). 
``CFPB.003--Non-Depository Supervision Database'' will be rescinded 
under separate notice.
    Second, the legal authorities for this system of records has been 
updated to clarify that it covers the CFPB's supervisory work pursuant 
to Federal consumer financial law.
    Third, the categories of individuals and categories of records has 
been expanded to account for the information collected on covered 
individuals associated with non-depository institutions and their 
affiliates and services providers subject to the authority of the CFPB.
    Fourth, this update seeks to clarify the types of individuals whose 
information is contained in this system of records and sources of 
records contained in the system of records. Some items in these 
sections have been reorganized and edited to more clearly identify the 
individuals whose records may be present in this system of records, 
including contact information for Federal, State, local and other 
government regulators associated with an action or matter.
    Finally, the CFPB will be making non-substantive revisions to this 
SORN to align with the Office of Management and Budget's recommended 
model in Circular A-108, appendix II. The report of the revised system 
of records has been submitted to the Committee on Oversight and 
Government Reform of the House of Representatives, the Committee on 
Homeland Security and Governmental Affairs of the Senate, and the 
Office of Management and Budget (OMB), in accordance with to OMB 
Circular A-108, ``Federal Agency Responsibilities for Review, 
Reporting, and Publication under the Privacy Act'' (Dec. 2016), and the
