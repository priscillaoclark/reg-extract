SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION: 
    OMB Number: 3133-0133.
    Title: Investment and Deposit Activities, 12 CFR part 703.
    Type of Review: Extension of a previously approved collection.
    Abstract: The National Credit Union Administration (NCUA) Federal 
Credit Union Act, 12 U.S.C. 1757(7), 1757(8), 1757(15), lists 
securities, deposits, and other obligations in which a Federal Credit 
Union (FCU) may invest. The regulations related to these areas are 
contained in Part 703 and Section 721.3 of the NCUA Rules and 
Regulations, which set forth requirements related to maintaining an 
adequate investment program. The information collected is used by the 
NCUA to determine compliance with the appropriate sections of the NCUA 
Rules and Regulations and FCU Act, which governs investment and deposit 
activities on the basis of safety and soundness concerns. It is used to 
determine the level of risk that exists within a credit union, the 
actions taken by the credit union to mitigate such risk, and helps 
prevent losses to federal credit unions and the National Credit Union 
Share Insurance Fund (NCUSIF).
    Affected Public: Private Sector: Not-for-profit institutions.
    Estimated Total Annual Burden Hours: 54,501.
    OMB Number: 3133-0190.
    Title: Loans in Areas Having Special Flood Hazards, 12 CFR 760.
    Type of Review: Extension of a previously approved collection.
    Abstract: This collection of information is set forth in NCUA 
regulations at 12 CFR part 760 and is required by the National Flood 
Insurance Reform Act of 1994's amendments to the National Flood 
Insurance Act of 1968 and the Flood Disaster Protection Act of 1973 
(Flood Act). The collection of information pertains to loans secured by 
buildings and mobile homes located or to be located in areas determined 
by the Director of the Federal Emergency Management Agency (FEMA) to 
have special flood hazards.
    Affected Public: Private Sector: Not-for-profit institutions.
    Estimated Total Annual Burden Hours: 185,213.
    OMB Number: 3133-0195.
    Title: Minority Depository Institution Preservation Program.
    Type of Review: Extension of a previously approved collection.
    Abstract: Dodd Frank Act amended sec. 308 of the FIRREA to require 
NCUA, Office of the Comptroller of Currency, and the Federal Reserve 
Board to establish a program to comply with its goals to preserve and 
encourage Minority Depository Institutions (MDIs). The NCUA Board 
issued Interpretive Ruling and Policy Statement (IRPS) 13-1 
establishing a MDI preservation program to comply with FIRREA Sec.  308 
goals. The IRPS identifies the procedure for a federally insured credit 
union to determine and document its ability to designate itself as a 
MDI, resulting in the ability to participate in the Program.
    Affected Public: Private Sector: Not-for-profit institutions.
    Estimated Total Annual Burden Hours: 38.
    Request for Comments: Comments submitted in response to this notice 
will be summarized and included in the request for Office of Management 
and Budget approval. All comments will become a matter of public 
record. The public is invited to submit comments concerning: (a) 
whether the collection of information is necessary for the proper 
performance of the function of the agency, including whether the 
information will have practical utility; (b) the accuracy of the 
agency's estimate of the burden of the collection of information, 
including the validity of the methodology and assumptions used; (c) 
ways to enhance the quality, utility, and clarity of the information to 
be collected; and (d) ways to minimize the burden of the collection of 
the information on the respondents, including the use of automated 
collection techniques or other forms of information technology.
