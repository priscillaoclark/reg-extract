Securities Exchange Act of 1934 (``Act''),\1\ approving and declaring 
effective an amendment to the plan for allocating regulatory

2 of the Act,\2\ by Cboe BZX Exchange, Inc. (``BZX''), BOX Exchange,

---------------------------------------------------------------------------

I. Introduction

    Section 19(g)(1) of the Act,\3\ among other things, requires every 
self-regulatory organization (``SRO'') registered as either a national 
securities exchange or national securities association to examine for, 
and enforce compliance by, its members and persons associated with its 
members with the Act, the rules and regulations thereunder, and the 
SRO's own rules, unless the SRO is relieved of this responsibility 
pursuant to Section 17(d) \4\ or Section 19(g)(2) \5\ of the Act. 
Without this relief, the statutory obligation of each individual SRO 
could result in a pattern of multiple examinations of broker-dealers 
that maintain memberships in more than one SRO (``common members''). 
Such regulatory duplication would add unnecessary expenses for common 
members and their SROs.
---------------------------------------------------------------------------

    \3\ 15 U.S.C. 78s(g)(1).
    \4\ 15 U.S.C. 78q(d).
    \5\ 15 U.S.C. 78s(g)(2).
---------------------------------------------------------------------------

    Section 17(d)(1) of the Act \6\ was intended, in part, to eliminate 
unnecessary multiple examinations and regulatory duplication.\7\ With 
respect to a common member, Section 17(d)(1) authorizes the Commission, 
by rule or order, to relieve an SRO of the responsibility to receive 
regulatory reports, to examine for and enforce compliance with 
applicable statutes, rules, and regulations, or to perform other 
specified regulatory functions.
---------------------------------------------------------------------------

    \6\ 15 U.S.C. 78q(d)(1).
    \7\ See Securities Act Amendments of 1975, Report of the Senate 
Committee on Banking, Housing, and Urban Affairs to Accompany S. 
249, S. Rep. No. 94-75, 94th Cong., 1st Session 32 (1975).
---------------------------------------------------------------------------

    To implement Section 17(d)(1), the Commission adopted two rules: 
Rule 17d-1 and Rule 17d-2 under the Act.\8\ Rule 17d-1 authorizes the 
Commission to name a single SRO as the designated examining authority 
(``DEA'') to examine common members for compliance with the financial 
responsibility requirements imposed by the Act, or by Commission or SRO 
rules.\9\ When an SRO has been named as a common member's DEA, all 
other SROs to which the common member belongs are relieved of the 
responsibility to examine the firm for compliance with the applicable 
financial responsibility rules. On its face, Rule 17d-1 deals only with 
an SRO's obligations to enforce member compliance with financial 
responsibility requirements. Rule 17d-1 does not relieve an SRO from 
its obligation to examine a common member for compliance with its own 
rules and provisions of the federal securities laws governing matters 
other than financial responsibility, including

[[Page 64013]]

sales practices and trading activities and practices.
---------------------------------------------------------------------------

    \8\ 17 CFR 240.17d-1 and 17 CFR 240.17d-2, respectively.
    \9\ See Securities Exchange Act Release No. 12352 (April 20, 
1976), 41 FR 18808 (May 7, 1976).
---------------------------------------------------------------------------

    To address regulatory duplication in these and other areas, the 
Commission adopted Rule 17d-2 under the Act.\10\ Rule 17d-2 permits 
SROs to propose joint plans for the allocation of regulatory 
responsibilities with respect to their common members. Under paragraph 
(c) of Rule 17d-2, the Commission may declare such a plan effective if, 
after providing for notice and comment, it determines that the plan is 
necessary or appropriate in the public interest and for the protection 
of investors, to foster cooperation and coordination among the SROs, to 
remove impediments to, and foster the development of, a national market 
system and a national clearance and settlement system, and is in 
conformity with the factors set forth in Section 17(d) of the Act. 
Commission approval of a plan filed pursuant to Rule 17d-2 relieves an 
SRO of those regulatory responsibilities allocated by the plan to 
another SRO.

II. The Plan

    On September 8, 1983, the Commission approved the SRO participants' 
plan for allocating regulatory responsibilities pursuant to Rule 17d-
2.\11\ On May 23, 2000, the Commission approved an amendment to the 
plan that added the ISE as a participant.\12\ On November 8, 2002, the 
Commission approved another amendment that replaced the original plan 
in its entirety and, among other things, allocated regulatory 
responsibilities among all the participants in a more equitable 
manner.\13\ On February 5, 2004, the Commission approved an amendment 
to the plan, primarily to include the BSE, which was establishing a new 
options trading facility to be known as BOX, as an SRO participant.\14\ 
On March 26, 2007, the Commission approved an amendment to the plan 
that, among other things, provided that the National Association of 
Securities Dealers (``NASD'') (n/k/a FINRA) and NYSE are Designated 
Options Examining Authorities under the plan.\15\ On March 12, 2008, 
the Commission approved an amendment to the plan primarily to add 
NASDAQ as an SRO participant.\16\ On June 18, 2008, the Commission 
approved an amendment to the plan primarily to remove the NYSE as a 
Designated Options Examining Authority, leaving FINRA as the sole 
Designated Options Examining Authority for all common members that are 
members of FINRA.\17\ On February 25, 2010, the Commission approved a 
proposed amendment to the plan to add Bats and C2 as SRO participants 
and to reflect the name changes of the American Stock Exchange LLC to 
the NYSE Amex LLC, the Boston Stock Exchange, Inc., to the NASDAQ OMX 
BX, Inc. and the Philadelphia Stock Exchange, Inc. to the NASDAQ OMX 
PHLX, Inc.\18\ On May 11, 2012, the Commission approved an amendment to 
the plan to add BOX as an SRO participant and to amend Section XIII of 
the plan to set forth a revised procedure for adding new participants 
to the plan.\19\ On December 5, 2012, the Commission approved an 
amendment to the plan to add MIAX as an SRO participant, and to change 
the name of NYSE Amex LLC to NYSE MKT LLC.\20\ On July 26, 2013, the 
Commission approved an amendment to the plan to add Topaz Exchange LLC 
as an SRO participant.\21\ On October 29, 2015, the Commission approved 
an amendment to the plan to add EDGX as an SRO participant and to 
change the name of Topaz Exchange, LLC to ISE Gemini, LLC.\22\ On 
February 16, 2016, the Commission approved an amendment to the plan to 
add ISE Mercury, and remove the NYSE, as an SRO participant to the 
Plan.\23\ On February 2, 2017, the Commission approved an amendment to 
the plan to add MIAX PEARL as an SRO participant to the Plan.\24\ On 
February 12, 2019, the Commission approved an amendment to the plan to 
add MIAX Emerald as an SRO participant to the Plan.\25\ On October 18, 
2022, the Commission approved an amendment to the plan to add MEMX as a 
Participant to the Plan to accommodate the launch of MEMX's options 
facility, to reflect name changes of certain Participating 
Organizations, and to reflect updated rule citations.\26\

---------------------------------------------------------------------------

    The plan reduces regulatory duplication for a large number of firms 
currently members of two or more of the SRO participants by allocating 
regulatory responsibility for certain options-related sales practice 
matters to one of the SRO participants. Generally, under the plan, the 
SRO participant responsible for conducting options-related sales 
practice examinations of a firm, and investigating options-related 
customer complaints and terminations for cause of associated persons of 
that firm, is known as the firm's ``Designated Options Examining 
Authority'' (``DOEA''). Pursuant to the plan, any other SRO of which 
the firm is a member is relieved of these responsibilities during the 
period in which the firm is assigned to another SRO acting as that 
firm's DOEA.

III. Proposed Amendment to the Plan

    On July 22, 2022, the Parties submitted a proposed amendment to the 
Plan. The primary purpose of the amendment is to add MIAX Sapphire as a

    This Agreement amends and restates the agreement entered into among 
the Participants on [January 2, 2019] September 20, 2022, entitled 
``Agreement by and among Cboe BZX Exchange, Inc., BOX Options Exchange,

    WHEREAS, the Participants are desirous of allocating regulatory 
responsibilities with respect to broker-dealers, and persons associated 
therewith, that are members \1\ of more than one Participant (the 
``Common Members'') and conduct a public business for compliance with 
Common Rules (as hereinafter defined) relating to the conduct by 
broker-dealers of accounts for listed options, index warrants, currency 
index warrants and currency warrants (collectively, ``Covered 
Securities''); and
---------------------------------------------------------------------------

    \1\ In the case of BZX, NYSE American, NYSE Arca, EDGX, MIAX 
PEARL, MEMX, PHLX and Nasdaq, members are those persons who are 
options participants (as defined in the BX, BZX, NYSE American, NYSE 
Arca, EDGX, MIAX PEARL, MEMX, PHLX and Nasdaq Options Market Rules).
---------------------------------------------------------------------------

    WHEREAS, the Participants are desirous of executing a plan for this 
purpose pursuant to the provisions of Rule 17d-2 and filing such plan 
with the Securities and Exchange Commission (``SEC'' or the 
``Commission'') for its approval;
    NOW, THEREFORE, in consideration of the mutual covenants contained 
hereafter, the Participants agree as follows:
    I. As used herein the term Designated Options Examining Authority 
(``DOEA'') shall mean: (1) FINRA insofar as it shall perform Regulatory 
Responsibility (as hereinafter defined) for its broker-dealer members 
that also are members of another Participant or (2) the Designated 
Examination Authority (``DEA'') pursuant to SEC Rule 17d-1 under the 
Securities Exchange Act (``Rule 17d-1'') for a broker-dealer that is a 
member of a more than one Participant (but not a member of FINRA).
    II. As used herein, the term ``Regulatory Responsibility'' shall 
mean the examination and enforcement responsibilities relating to 
compliance by Common Members with the rules of the applicable 
Participant that are substantially similar to the rules of the other 
Participants (the ``Common Rules''), insofar as they apply to the 
conduct of accounts for Covered Securities. A list of the current 
Common Rules of each Participant applicable to the conduct of accounts 
for Covered Securities is attached hereto as Exhibit A. Each year 
within 30 days of the anniversary date of the commencement of operation 
of this Agreement, each Participant shall submit in writing to FINRA 
and each DEA performing as a DOEA for any members of such Participant 
any revisions to Exhibit A reflecting changes in the rules of the 
Participant, and confirm that all other rules of the Participant listed 
in Exhibit A continue to meet the definition of Common Rules as defined 
in this Agreement. Within 30 days from the date that FINRA and each DEA 
performing as a DOEA has received revisions and/or confirmation that no 
change has been made to Exhibit A from all Participants, FINRA and each 
DEA performing as a DOEA shall confirm in writing to each Participant 
whether the rules listed in any updated Exhibit A are Common Rules as 
defined in this Agreement. Notwithstanding anything herein to the 
contrary, it is explicitly understood that the term ``Regulatory 
Responsibility'' does not include, and each of the Participants shall 
(unless allocated pursuant to Rule 17d-2 otherwise than under this 
Agreement) retain full responsibility for, each of the following:
    (a) Surveillance and enforcement with respect to trading activities 
or practices involving its own marketplace, including without 
limitation its rules relating to the rights and obligations of 
specialists and other market makers;
    (b) Registration pursuant to its applicable rules of associated 
persons;
    (c) Discharge of its duties and obligations as a DEA; and
    (d) Evaluation of advertising, responsibility for which shall 
remain with the Participant to which a Common Member submits same for 
approval.
    III. Apparent violations of another Participant's rules discovered 
by a DOEA, but which rules are not within the scope of the discovering 
DOEA's Regulatory Responsibility, shall be referred to the relevant 
Participant for such action as the Participant to which such matter has 
been referred deems appropriate. Notwithstanding the foregoing, nothing 
contained herein shall preclude a DOEA in its discretion from 
requesting that another Participant conduct an enforcement proceeding 
on a matter for which the requesting DOEA has Regulatory 
Responsibility. If such other Participants agree, the Regulatory 
Responsibility in such case shall be deemed transferred to the 
accepting Participant and confirmed in writing by the Participants 
involved. Each Participant agrees, upon request, to make available 
promptly all relevant files, records and/or witnesses necessary to 
assist another Participant in an investigation or enforcement 
proceeding.
    IV. The Council shall be composed of one representative designated 
by each of the Participants. Each Participant shall also designate one 
or more persons as its alternate representative(s). In the absence of 
the representative of a Participant, such alternate representative 
shall have the same powers, duties and responsibilities as the 
representative. Each Participant may, at any time, by notice to the 
then Chair of the Council, replace its representative and/or its 
alternate representative on such Council. A majority of the Council 
shall constitute a quorum and, unless specifically otherwise required, 
the affirmative vote of a majority of the Council members present (in 
person, by telephone or by written consent) shall be necessary to 
constitute action by the Council. The representative from FINRA shall 
serve as Chair of the Council. All notices and other communications for 
the Council shall be sent to it in care of the Chair or to each of the 
representatives.
    V. The Council shall determine the times and locations of Council 
meetings, provided that the Chair, acting alone, may also call a 
meeting of the Council

[[Page 64015]]

in the event the Chair determines that there is good cause to do so. To 
the extent reasonably possible, notice of any meeting shall be given at 
least ten-business days prior thereto. Notwithstanding anything herein 
to the contrary, representatives shall always be given the option of 
participating in any meeting telephonically at their own expense rather 
than in person.
    VI. FINRA shall have Regulatory Responsibility for all Common 
Members that are members of FINRA. For the purpose of fulfilling the 
Participants' Regulatory Responsibilities for Common Members that are 
not members of FINRA, the Participant that is the DEA shall serve as 
the DOEA. All Participants shall promptly notify the DOEAs no later 
than the next scheduled meeting of any change in membership of Common 
Members. A DOEA may request that a Common Member that is allocated to 
it be reallocated to another DOEA by giving thirty days written notice 
thereof. The DOEAs in their discretion may approve such request and 
reallocate such Common Member to another DOEA.
    VII. Each DOEA shall conduct an examination of each Common Member. 
The Participants agree that, upon request, relevant information in 
their respective files relative to a Common Member will be made 
available to the applicable DOEA. At each meeting of the Council, each 
DOEA shall be prepared to report on the status of its examination 
program for the previous quarter and any period prior thereto that has 
not previously been reported to the Council.
    VIII. Each DOEA will promptly furnish a copy of the Examination 
report, relating to Covered Securities, of any examination made 
pursuant to the provisions of this Agreement to each other Participant 
of which the Common Member examined is a member.
    IX. Each DOEA's Regulatory Responsibility shall for each Common 
Member allocated to it include investigations into terminations ``for 
cause'' of associated persons relating to Covered Securities, unless 
such termination is related solely to another Participant's market. In 
the latter instance, that Participant to whose market the termination 
for cause relates shall discharge Regulatory Responsibility with 
respect to such termination for cause. In connection with a DOEA's 
examination, investigation and/or enforcement proceeding regarding a 
Covered Security-related termination for cause, the other Participants 
of which the Common Member is a member shall furnish, upon request, 
copies of all pertinent materials related thereto in their possession. 
As used in this Section, ``for cause'' shall include, without 
limitation, terminations characterized on Form U5 under the label 
``Permitted to Resign.'' ``Discharge'' or ``Other.''
    X. Each DOEA shall discharge the Regulatory Responsibility for each 
Common Member allocated to it relative to a Covered Securities-related 
customer complaint \2\ unless such complaint is uniquely related to 
another Participant's market. In the latter instance, the DOEA shall 
forward the matter to that Participant to whose market the matter 
relates, and the latter shall discharge Regulatory Responsibility with 
respect thereto. If a Participant receives a customer complaint for a 
Common Member related to a Covered Security for which the Participant 
is not the DOEA, the Participant shall promptly forward a copy of such 
complaint to the DOEA.
---------------------------------------------------------------------------

    \2\ For purposes of complaints, they can be reported pursuant to 
Form U4, Form U5 or RE-3 and any amendments thereto.
---------------------------------------------------------------------------

    XI. Any written notice required or permitted to be given under this 
Agreement shall be deemed given if sent by certified mail, return 
receipt requested, or by a comparable means of electronic communication 
to each Participant entitled to receipt thereof, to the attention of 
the Participant's representative on the Council at the Participant's 
then principal office or by email at such address as the representative 
shall have filed in writing with the Chair.
    XII. The Participants shall notify the Common Members of this 
Agreement by means of a uniform joint notice approved by the Council.
    XIII. This Agreement may be amended to add a new Participant 
provided that such Participant does not assume Regulatory 
Responsibility, solely by an amendment by FINRA and such new 
Participant. All other Participants expressly consent to allow FINRA to 
add new Participants to this Agreement as provided above. FINRA will 
promptly notify all Participants of any such amendments to add new 
Participants. All other amendments to this Agreement must be approved 
in writing by each Participant. All amendments, including adding a new 
Participant, must be filed with and approved by the SEC before they 
become effective.
    XIV. Any of the Participants may manifest its intention to cancel 
its participation in this Agreement at any time by giving the Council 
written notice thereof at least 90 days prior to the effective date of 
such cancellation. Upon receipt of such notice the Council shall 
allocate, in accordance with the provisions of this Agreement, any 
Common Members for which the petitioning party was the DOEA. Until such 
time as the Council has completed the reallocation described above; the 
petitioning Participant shall retain all its rights, privileges, duties 
and obligations hereunder.
    XV. The cancellation of its participation in this Agreement by any 
Participant shall not terminate this Agreement as to the remaining 
Participants. This Agreement will only terminate following notice to 
the Commission, in writing, by the then Participants that they intend 
to terminate the Agreement and the expiration of the applicable notice 
period. Such notice shall be given at least six months prior to the 
intended date of termination, provided that in the event a notice of 
cancellation is received from a Participant that, assuming the 
effectiveness thereof, would result in there being just one remaining 
member of the Council, notice to the Commission of termination of this 
Agreement shall be given promptly upon the receipt of such notice of 
cancellation, which termination shall be effective upon the 
effectiveness of the cancellation that triggered the notice of 
termination to the Commission.
    XVI. No Participant nor the Council nor any of their respective 
directors, governors, officers, employees or representatives shall be 
liable to any other Participant in this Agreement for any liability, 
loss or damage resulting from or claimed to have resulted from any 
delays, inaccuracies, errors or omissions with respect to the provision 
of Regulatory Responsibility as provided hereby or for the failure to 
provide any such Responsibility, except with respect to such liability, 
loss or damages as shall have been suffered by one or more of the 
Participants and caused by the willful misconduct of one or more of the 
other participants or their respective directors, governors, officers, 
employees or representatives. No warranties, express or implied, are 
made by any or all of the Participants or the Council with respect to 
any Regulatory Responsibility to be performed by each of them 
hereunder.
    XVII. Pursuant to Section 17(d)(1)(A) of the Securities Exchange 
Act of 1934 and Rule 17d-2 promulgated pursuant thereto, the 
Participants join in requesting the Securities and Exchange Commission, 
upon its approval of this Agreement or any part thereof, to relieve 
those Participants which are from time to time participants in this 
Agreement

[[Page 64016]]

Commission process and review your comments more efficiently, please

Commission's internet website (<a href="https://www.sec.gov/rules/sro.shtml">https://www.sec.gov/rules/sro.shtml</a>). 
Copies of the submission, all subsequent amendments, all written 
statements with respect to the proposed plan that are filed with the 
Commission, and all written communications relating to the proposed 
plan between the Commission and any person, other than those that may 
be withheld from the public in accordance with the provisions of 5

V. Discussion

    The Commission continues to believe that the proposed plan is an 
achievement in cooperation among the SRO participants. The Plan, as 
amended, will reduce unnecessary regulatory duplication by allocating 
to the designated SRO the responsibility for certain options-related 
sales practice matters that would otherwise be performed by multiple 
SROs. The plan promotes efficiency by reducing costs to firms that are 
members of more than one of the SRO participants. In addition, because 
the SRO participants coordinate their regulatory functions in 
accordance with the plan, the plan promotes, and

[[Page 64021]]

will continue to promote, investor protection.
    Under paragraph (c) of Rule 17d-2, the Commission may, after 
appropriate notice and comment, declare a plan, or any part of a plan, 
effective. In this instance, the Commission believes that appropriate 
notice and comment can take place after the proposed amendment is 
effective. The primary purpose of the amendment is to add MIAX Sapphire 
as a Participant to the Plan. By declaring it effective today, the 
amended Plan can become effective and be implemented without undue 
delay. The Commission notes that the prior version of this plan 
immediately prior to this proposed amendment was published for comment 
and the Commission did not receive any comments thereon.\27\ 
Furthermore, the Commission does not believe that the amendment to the 
plan raises any new regulatory issues that the Commission has not 
previously considered.

VI. Conclusion

    This order gives effect to the amended Plan submitted to the 
Commission that is contained in File No. S7-966.
    It is therefore ordered, pursuant to Section 17(d) of the Act, that 
the Plan, as amended, filed with the Commission pursuant to Rule 17d-2 
on July 22, 2024, is hereby approved and declared effective.
    It is further ordered that those SRO participants that are not the 
DOEA as to a particular common member are relieved of those regulatory 
responsibilities allocated to the common member's DOEA under the 
amended Plan to the extent of such allocation.

    For the Commission, by the Division of Trading and Markets, 
pursuant to delegated authority.\28\
