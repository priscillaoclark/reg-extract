Final Approval Under OMB Delegated Authority of the Extension for Three 
Years, With Revision, of the Following Information Collection

    Collection title: Senior Financial Officer Surveys.
    Collection identifier: FR 2023.
    OMB control number: 7100-0223.
    General description of collection: The Board uses the surveys in 
this collection to gather qualitative and limited quantitative 
information about liability management, the provision of financial 
services, and the functioning of key financial markets from a selection 
of up to 80 large commercial banks and other depository institutions 
(or, if appropriate, from other major financial market participants). 
This voluntary survey is completed by a senior officer at each 
respondent institution. In recent years, the Board has conducted two 
surveys per year, but it may conduct up to four surveys per year when 
significant informational needs arise that cannot be met from existing 
data sources.
    Frequency: Up to four times a year.
    Respondents: Domestic depository institutions and foreign banking 
organizations.
    Total estimated number of respondents: 100.
    Total estimated change in burden: 240.
    Total estimated annual burden hours: 1,200.
    Current actions: On March 7, 2024, the Board published a notice in 
the Federal Register (89 FR 16568) requesting public comment for 60 
days on the extension, with revision, of the FR 2023. The Board 
proposed revising the FR 2023 to increase the respondent panel size 
from 80 to 100 and change the method of collection from email to an 
online survey tool. The comment period for this notice expired on May 
6, 2024. The Board did not receive any comments. The revisions will be 
implemented as proposed.

    Board of Governors of the Federal Reserve System, July 23, 2024.
Michele Taylor Fennell,
Deputy Associate Secretary of the Board.
