I. Self-Regulatory Organization's Statement of the Terms of Substance 
of the Proposed Rule Change

    The Exchange proposes to amend the Exchange's Pricing Schedule at 
Options 7, Section 3. While these amendments are effective upon filing, 
the Exchange has designated the proposed amendments to be operative on 
August 1, 2024.
    The text of the proposed rule change is available on the Exchange's 
website at <a href="https://listingcenter.nasdaq.com/rulebook/mrx/rules">https://listingcenter.nasdaq.com/rulebook/mrx/rules</a>, at the 
principal office of the Exchange, and at the Commission's Public 
Reference Room.

II. Self-Regulatory Organization's Statement of the Purpose of, and 
Statutory Basis for, the Proposed Rule Change

    In its filing with the Commission, the Exchange included statements 
concerning the purpose of and basis for the proposed rule change and 
discussed any comments it received on the proposed rule change. The 
text of these statements may be examined at the places specified in 
Item IV below. The Exchange has prepared summaries, set forth in 
sections A, B, and C below, of the most significant aspects of such 
statements.

A. Self-Regulatory Organization's Statement of the Purpose of, and 
Statutory Basis for, the Proposed Rule Change

1. Purpose
    The purpose of the proposed rule change is to amend the Exchange's 
Pricing Schedule at Options 7, Section 3.
Maker/Taker Pricing
    Today, as set forth in Table 1 of Options 7, Section 3, the 
Exchange assesses Market Makers \3\ and Priority Customers \4\ the 
below tiered maker/taker fees and rebates in Penny and Non-Penny 
Symbols that are based on increasing volume requirements set forth in 
Table 3 of Options 7, Section 3.\5\
---------------------------------------------------------------------------

    \3\ A ``Market Maker'' is a market maker as defined in Nasdaq 
MRX Rule Options 1, Section 1(a)(21).
    \4\ A ``Priority Customer'' is a person or entity that is not a 
broker/dealer in securities, and does not place more than 390 orders 
in listed options per day on average during a calendar month for its 
own beneficial account(s), as defined in Nasdaq MRX Options 1, 
Section 1(a)(36).
    \5\ The tiered volume requirements are based on Total Customer 
ADV. Total Customer ADV is Priority Customer Total Consolidated 
Volume divided by Customer Total Consolidated Volume, including 
volume executed by Affiliated Members or Affiliated Entities. 
Priority Customer Total Consolidated Volume is a Member's total 
Priority Customer volume executed on MRX in that month, including 
volume executed by Affiliated Members or Affiliated Entities. All 
eligible volume from Affiliated Members or an Affiliated Entity will 
be aggregated in determining applicable tiers.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
                                                                                                       Taker fee/   Taker fee/   Taker fee/   Taker fee/

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Penny Symbols:
    Market Maker................................        $0.50        $0.50        $0.50        $0.50        $0.35        $0.35        $0.35        $0.35
    Priority Customer...........................         0.00         0.00         0.00         0.00       (0.31)       (0.36)       (0.41)       (0.44)
Non-Penny Symbols:
    Market Maker................................         1.25         1.25         1.25         1.25         1.10         1.10         1.10         1.10
    Priority Customer...........................         0.00         0.00         0.00         0.00       (0.80)       (0.90)       (1.00)       (1.10)
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

    Additionally, for SPY, QQQ, and IWM, the Exchange currently 
assesses $0.00 per contract for Market Maker Tier 1 through Tier 4 
Maker Fees and Priority Customer Tier 1 through Tier 4 Taker Fees/
Rebates in Penny Symbols.\6\ In other words, Market Makers can provide 
liquidity in these symbols at no cost (instead of paying the $0.50 
Tiers 1-4 Maker Fee in Penny Symbols), and Priority Customers can 
remove liquidity in these symbols at no cost (instead of receiving the 
Tiers 1-4 Taker Rebates in Penny Symbols ranging from $0.31-$0.44 per 
contract).
---------------------------------------------------------------------------

    \6\ See note 6, Options 7, Section 3, Table 1.
---------------------------------------------------------------------------

    The Exchange now proposes to amend the pricing for SPY, QQQ, and 
IWM as described above to begin charging $0.02 per contract for Market 
Maker Tier 1 through Tier 4 Maker Fees in these symbols. Further, the 
Exchange proposes to begin providing $0.02 per contract for Priority 
Customer Tier 1

[[Page 67131]]

through Tier 4 Taker Rebates in these symbols. As proposed, note 6 will 
provide: ``Market Maker Tier 1 through Tier 4 Maker Fees in Penny 
Symbols will be $0.02 per contract for the following option symbols: 
SPY, QQQ and IWM. Priority Customer Tier 1 through Tier 4 Taker Rebates 
in Penny Symbols will be ($0.02) per contract for the following option 
symbols: SPY, QQQ and IWM.''
    The Exchange also proposes to modify the Priority Customer Tiers 1-
4 Taker Rebates in Penny and Non-Penny Symbols as described above. 
Specifically, the Exchange proposes in new note 7 of Options 7, Section 
3, Table 1 that Priority Customer orders will not receive any Taker 
Rebates in Penny and Non-Penny Symbols for trades executed against 
another Priority Customer order. Instead, the Priority Customer order 
will be assessed $0.00 per contract.
PIM Break-Up Rebates
    Today, as set forth in Options 7, Section 3.A, the Exchange pays a 
PIM break-up rebate to an originating Priority Customer PIM order that 
executes with a response (order or quote), other than the PIM contra-
side order, of $0.25 per contract in Penny Symbols and $0.60 per 
contract in Non-Penny Symbols.\7\ The Exchange also offers additional 
break-up rebates in note 3 of Options 7, Section 3.A for Members that 
meet certain volume requirements or alternatively, that enter into 
Affiliated Member \8\ or Affiliated Entity \9\ relationships. In 
particular, note 3 currently provides: ``Break-up Rebates are provided 
for an originating Priority Customer PIM Order that executes with any 
response (order or quote) other than the PIM contra-side order. Members 
that are not in an Affiliated Member or Affiliated Entity relationship 
and that execute 0.05% or greater of Customer Total Consolidated Volume 
\10\ which adds liquidity in non-PIM Priority Customer contracts within 
a month will receive an additional rebate of: (i) $0.20 per contract in 
Penny Symbols for Complex PIM Orders only, (ii) $0.15 per contract in 
Penny Symbols for Regular PIM Orders only, and (iii) $0.45 per contract 
in Non-Penny Symbols for both Regular and Complex PIM Orders. 
Alternatively, Affiliated Members or Affiliated Entities will be 
eligible to receive the rebates in this note 3 without any additional 
volume requirements. The Exchange will provide the rebate to the OFP 
arm of an Affiliated Member relationship, or the Appointed OFP arm of 
an Affiliated Entity relationship.''
---------------------------------------------------------------------------

    \7\ Break-up rebates apply only to regular PIM orders of 500 or 
fewer contracts and to complex PIM orders where the largest leg is 
500 or fewer contracts.
    \8\ An ``Affiliated Member'' is a Member that shares at least 
75% common ownership with a particular Member as reflected on the 
Member's Form BD, Schedule A.
    \9\ An ``Affiliated Entity'' is a relationship between an 
Appointed Market Maker and an Appointed OFP for purposes of 
qualifying for certain pricing specified in the Pricing Schedule. 
Market Makers and OFPs are required to send an email to the Exchange 
to appoint their counterpart, at least 3 business days prior to the 
last day of the month to qualify for the next month. The Exchange 
will acknowledge receipt of the emails and specify the date the 
Affiliated Entity is eligible for applicable pricing, as specified 
in the Pricing Schedule. Each Affiliated Entity relationship will 
commence on the 1st of a month and may not be terminated prior to 
the end of any month. An Affiliated Entity relationship will 
automatically renew each month until or unless either party 
terminates earlier in writing by sending an email to the Exchange at 
least 3 business days prior to the last day of the month to 
terminate for the next month. Affiliated Members may not qualify as 
a counterparty comprising an Affiliated Entity. Each Member may 
qualify for only one (1) Affiliated Entity relationship at any given 
time.
    \10\ ``Customer Total Consolidated Volume'' means the total 
volume cleared at The Options Clearing Corporation in the Customer 
range in equity and ETF options in that month.
---------------------------------------------------------------------------

    The Exchange now proposes to modify the note 3 rebate 
qualifications only for those Members that are not in Affiliated Member 
or Affiliated Entity relationships. Under this proposal, Affiliated 
Members or Affiliated Entities will continue to be eligible to receive 
the note 3 rebates without any additional volume requirements. 
Specifically, the Exchange proposes to require Members not in 
Affiliated Member or Affiliated Entity relationships to execute 0.04% 
or greater of Customer Total Consolidated Volume which adds liquidity 
in non-PIM Priority Customer contracts in regular orders within a month 
to receive the additional rebates in note 3.
2. Statutory Basis
    The Exchange believes that its proposal is consistent with Section 
6(b) of the Act,\11\ in general, and furthers the objectives of 
Sections 6(b)(4) and 6(b)(5) of the Act,\12\ in particular, in that it 
provides for the equitable allocation of reasonable dues, fees, and 
other charges among members and issuers and other persons using any 
facility, and is not designed to permit unfair discrimination between 
customers, issuers, brokers, or dealers.

    \12\ 15 U.S.C. 78f(b)(4) and (5).
---------------------------------------------------------------------------

    The Exchange's proposed changes to its schedule of credits are 
reasonable in several respects. As a threshold matter, the Exchange is 
subject to significant competitive forces in the market for options 
securities transaction services that constrain its pricing 
determinations in that market. The fact that this market is competitive 
has long been recognized by the courts. In NetCoalition v. Securities 
and Exchange Commission, the D.C. Circuit stated as follows: ``[n]o one 
disputes that competition for order flow is `fierce.' . . . As the SEC 
explained, `[i]n the U.S. national market system, buyers and sellers of 
securities, and the broker-dealers that act as their order-routing 
agents, have a wide range of choices of where to route orders for 
execution'; [and] `no exchange can afford to take its market share 
percentages for granted' because `no exchange possesses a monopoly, 
regulatory or otherwise, in the execution of order flow from broker 
dealers'. . . .'' \13\
---------------------------------------------------------------------------

    \13\ NetCoalition v. SEC, 615 F.3d 525, 539 (D.C. Cir. 2010) 
(quoting Securities Exchange Act Release No. 59039 (December 2, 
2008), 73 FR 74770, 74782-83 (December 9, 2008) (SR-NYSEArca-2006-
21)).
---------------------------------------------------------------------------

    The Commission and the courts have repeatedly expressed their 
preference for competition over regulatory intervention in determining 
prices, products, and services in the securities markets. In Regulation 
NMS, while adopting a series of steps to improve the current market 
model, the Commission highlighted the importance of market forces in 
determining prices and SRO revenues and, also, recognized that current 
regulation of the market system ``has been remarkably successful in 
promoting market competition in its broader forms that are most 
important to investors and listed companies.'' \14\
---------------------------------------------------------------------------

    \14\ Securities Exchange Act Release No. 51808 (June 9, 2005), 
70 FR 37496, 37499 (June 29, 2005) (``Regulation NMS Adopting 
Release'').
---------------------------------------------------------------------------

    Numerous indicia demonstrate the competitive nature of this market. 
For example, clear substitutes to the Exchange exist in the market for 
options security transaction services. The Exchange is only one of 
seventeen options exchanges to which market participants may direct 
their order flow. Within this environment, market participants can 
freely and often do shift their order flow among the Exchange and 
competing venues in response to changes in their respective pricing 
schedules. As such, the proposal represents a reasonable attempt by the 
Exchange to increase its liquidity and market share relative to its 
competitors.
Maker/Taker Pricing
    The Exchange believes that the proposed changes to the maker/taker 
pricing for Market Makers and Priority Customers in the manner 
described above are reasonable, equitable and not unfairly 
discriminatory for the reasons that follow.

[[Page 67132]]

SPY, QQQ, IWM Pricing
    The Exchange believes that it is reasonable to begin charging $0.02 
per contract for Market Maker Tier 1 through Tier 4 Maker Fees in SPY, 
QQQ, and IWM, and to begin providing $0.02 per contract for Priority 
Customer Tier 1 through Tier 4 Taker Rebates in these symbols. As it 
relates to Market Makers, the Exchange notes that it is only increasing 
the Tier 1 through Tier 4 Maker Fees by a small amount (i.e., from 
$0.00 to $0.02). Further, Market Makers will continue to be charged 
significantly less for adding liquidity in SPY, QQQ, and IWM ($0.02) 
than for adding liquidity in other Penny Symbols ($0.50). As it relates 
to Priority Customers, the Exchange will begin providing Tier 1 through 
Tier 4 Taker Rebates of $0.02 whereas today, Priority Customers do not 
receive any Taker Rebates for removing liquidity in SPY, QQQ, and IWM. 
The Exchange therefore believes that with the proposed changes, Market 
Makers and Priority Customers will continue to be incentivized to bring 
SPY, QQQ, and IWM order flow to MRX, which benefits all market 
participants by providing more trading opportunities. The Exchange also 
believes that assessing different pricing for SPY, QQQ, and IWM, as 
compared to other symbols, is reasonable because trading in SPY, QQQ, 
and IWM is different from trading in other symbols in that they are 
more liquid, have higher volume and competition for executions is more 
intense.
    The Exchange believes that the proposed changes to the SPY, QQQ, 
and IWM pricing for Market Makers and Priority Customers are equitable 
and not unfairly discriminatory because they will apply uniformly to 
similarly situated market participants (i.e., the proposed Tier 1 
through Tier 4 Maker Fees in SPY, QQQ, and IWM will apply uniformly to 
Market Makers and the proposed Tier 1 through Tier 4 Taker Rebates in 
SPY, QQQ, and IWM will apply uniformly to Priority Customers). The 
Exchange believes that it is equitable and not unfairly discriminatory 
to apply the proposed changes to only Market Makers and Priority 
Customers. As it relates to Market Makers, the Exchange notes that they 
have different requirements and additional obligations that other 
market participants do not (such as quoting requirements).\15\ As such, 
the proposed Maker Fees of $0.02 per contract (which continue to be 
significantly lower than the $0.50 per contract Market Maker Maker Fees 
assessed for other Penny Symbols) are designed to continue to 
incentivize Market Maker add liquidity activity in SPY, QQQ, and IWM. 
As it relates to Priority Customers, the Exchange notes that these 
market participants have historically received more favorable pricing 
on the Exchange.\16\ Further, an increase in the activity of Priority 
Customers benefits all market participants by providing more trading 
opportunities, which attracts Market Makers. An increase in the 
activity of these market participants, in turn, facilitates tighter 
spreads, which may cause an additional corresponding increase in order 
flow from other market participants, to the benefit of all market 
participants.
---------------------------------------------------------------------------

    \15\ See Options 2, Section 5.
    \16\ See, e.g., maker/taker pricing for Priority Customers in 
Options 7, Section 3, Table 1; and complex order fees for Priority 
Customers in Options 7, Section 4.
---------------------------------------------------------------------------

Priority Customer Taker Pricing
    As discussed above, the Exchange proposes in new note 7 of Options 
7, Section 3, Table 1 that Priority Customer orders will not receive 
the Tier 1 through Tier 4 Taker Rebates in Penny and Non-Penny Symbols 
for trades executed against another Priority Customer order. Instead, 
the Priority Customer order will be assessed $0.00 per contract. The 
Exchange believes that its proposal is reasonable because Priority 
Customers will continue to receive more favorable pricing for removing 
liquidity in Penny and Non-Penny Symbols compared to Non-Priority 
Customers.\17\ Specifically, as set forth in Table 1 of Options 7, 
Section 3, all Non-Priority Customers currently pay a $0.35 Taker Fee 
in Tiers 1-4 for removing liquidity in Penny Symbols, and a $1.10 Taker 
Fee in Tiers 1-4 for removing liquidity in Non-Penny Symbols. 
Additionally, Priority Customers will continue to receive the generous 
Taker Rebates in Penny and Non-Penny Symbols for trades executed 
against Non-Priority Customers. The Exchange notes that other options 
exchanges, including for example its affiliate Nasdaq GEMX (``GEMX''), 
assess different taker pricing depending on the counterparty.\18\
---------------------------------------------------------------------------

    \17\ ``Non-Priority Customers'' include Market Makers, Non-
Nasdaq MRX Market Makers (FarMMs), Firm Proprietary/Broker-Dealers, 
and Professional Customers.
    \18\ See GEMX Pricing Schedule at Options 7, Section 3, note 16.
---------------------------------------------------------------------------

    The Exchange believes that its proposal is equitable and not 
unfairly discriminatory because it will apply uniformly to all Priority 
Customers. The Exchange does not believe it is unfairly discriminatory 
to apply the proposed changes to only Priority Customers because 
Priority Customers will continue to receive more favorable pricing for 
removing liquidity in Penny and Non-Penny Symbols compared to Non-
Priority Customers, as discussed above. The Exchange has historically 
provided more favorable pricing to Priority Customers.\19\ Furthermore, 
Priority Customer order flow enhances liquidity on the Exchange for the 
benefit of all market participants by providing more trading 
opportunities, which in turn attracts Market Makers and other market 
participants that may trade with this order flow.
---------------------------------------------------------------------------

    \19\ See supra note 16.
---------------------------------------------------------------------------

PIM Break-Up Rebates
    The Exchange believes that the proposed changes to the 
qualifications for receiving the additional PIM break-up rebates in 
note 3 of Options 7, Section 3.A are reasonable, equitable, and not 
unfairly discriminatory for the reasons that follow. As discussed 
above, the Exchange is proposing to require Members not in Affiliated 
Member or Affiliated Entity relationships to execute 0.04% or greater 
of Customer Total Consolidated Volume which adds liquidity in non-PIM 
Priority Customer contracts in regular orders within a month to receive 
the additional rebates in note 3. With the proposed changes, the 
Exchange is effectively lowering the volume requirement and narrowing 
the scope of the rebate qualifications to regular orders. The Exchange 
believes that the lower volume requirement of 0.04% (versus the current 
0.05%) is reasonable because it will further incentivize Members to 
bring liquidity adding non-PIM regular order flow for execution on the 
Exchange for the same rebate amounts, which the Exchange believes may 
result in tighter spreads, thereby making the Exchange a more 
attractive trading venue to the benefit of all market participants. The 
Exchange also believes it is reasonable to narrow the scope of the 
rebate qualifications in note 3 to only non-PIM regular orders because 
the Exchange believes that market participants are already sufficiently 
incentivized to bring Priority Customer non-PIM complex order flow to 
MRX through the Exchange's existing pricing schedule.\20\
---------------------------------------------------------------------------

    \20\ Specifically, the Exchange does not assess any complex 
order fees for Priority Customers today. See Options 7, Section 4.
---------------------------------------------------------------------------

    The Exchange also believes that the proposed changes to the 
additional PIM break-up rebate qualifications are equitable and not 
unfairly discriminatory because the changes will apply uniformly to all 
similarly situated market participants. While the rebates

[[Page 67133]]

will continue to apply only to Priority Customers, the Exchange 
believes that the application of this rebate program is equitable and 
not unfairly discriminatory because the Exchange has historically 
provided more favorable pricing for Priority Customers.\21\ 
Furthermore, Priority Customer order flow benefits all market 
participants by providing more trading opportunities, which attracts 
Market Makers. An increase in the activity of these market participants 
in turn facilitates tighter spreads, which may cause an additional 
corresponding increase in order flow from other market participants, to 
the benefit of all market participants.
---------------------------------------------------------------------------

    \21\ See supra note 16.
---------------------------------------------------------------------------

B. Self-Regulatory Organization's Statement on Burden on Competition

    The Exchange does not believe that the proposed rule change will 
impose any burden on competition not necessary or appropriate in 
furtherance of the purposes of the Act.
    In terms of intra-market competition, the Exchange does not believe 
that its proposal will place any category of market participants at a 
competitive disadvantage. The Exchange believes that all of the changes 
proposed above will incentivize market participants to direct more 
order flow to the Exchange, to the benefit of all market participants 
who may interact with this order flow. While some aspects of the 
proposal apply directly to Market Makers (through the Market Maker Tier 
1 through Tier 4 Maker Fees for SPY, QQQ, and IWM) or Priority 
Customers (through the Priority Customer Tier 1 through Tier 4 Taker 
Rebates for SPY, QQQ, and IWM; the $0.00 Taker Fee in Penny and Non-
Penny Symbols when trading against another Priority Customer order; and 
the PIM break-up rebate qualification changes), the Exchange believes 
that the proposed changes taken together will fortify and encourage 
activity, especially Market Maker and Priority Customer activity, on 
the Exchange. As discussed above, all market participants will benefit 
from any increase in market activity that the proposal effectuates.
    In terms of inter-market competition, the Exchange notes that it 
operates in a highly competitive market in which market participants 
can readily favor competing venues if they deem fee levels at a 
particular venue to be excessive, or rebate opportunities available at 
other venues to be more favorable. In such an environment, the Exchange 
must continually adjust its fees to remain competitive with other 
options exchanges. Because competitors are free to modify their own 
fees in response, and because market participants may readily adjust 
their order routing practices, the Exchange believes that the degree to 
which fee changes in this market may impose any burden on competition 
is extremely limited. In sum, if the changes proposed herein are 
unattractive to market participants, it is likely that the Exchange 
will lose market share as a result. Accordingly, the Exchange does not 
believe that the proposed changes will impair the ability of members or 
competing order execution venues to maintain their competitive standing 
in the financial markets.
