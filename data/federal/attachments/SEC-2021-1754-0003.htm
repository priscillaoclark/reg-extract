SECURITIES AND EXCHANGE COMMISSION

[SEC File No. 270-135, OMB Control No. 3235-0175]


Proposed Collection; Comment Request; Extension: Form N-8A

Upon Written Request, Copies Available From: Securities and Exchange 
Commission, Office of FOIA Services, 100 F Street NE, Washington, DC 
20549-2736

    Notice is hereby given that, pursuant to the Paperwork Reduction 
Act of 1995 (44 U.S.C. 3501 et seq.), the Securities and Exchange 
Commission (the ``Commission'') is soliciting comments on the 
collection of information summarized below. The Commission plans to 
submit this existing collection of information to the Office of 
Management and Budget (``OMB'') for extension and approval.
    The Investment Company Act of 1940 (``Investment Company Act'') (15 
U.S.C. 80a-1 et seq.) requires investment companies to register with 
the Commission before they conduct any business in interstate commerce. 
Section 8(a) of the Investment Company Act provides that an investment 
company shall be deemed to be registered upon receipt by the Commission 
of a notification of registration in such form as the Commission 
prescribes. Form N-8A (17 CFR 274.10) is the form for notification of 
registration that the Commission has adopted under section 8(a). The 
purpose of such notification of registration provided on Form N-8A is 
to notify the Commission of the existence of investment companies 
required to be registered under the Investment Company Act and to 
enable the Commission to administer the provisions of the Investment 
Company Act with respect to those companies. After an investment 
company has filed its notification of registration under

[[Page 99320]]

section 8(a), the company is then subject to the provisions of the 
Investment Company Act which govern certain aspects of its organization 
and activities, such as the composition of its board of directors and 
the issuance of senior securities. Form N-8A requires an investment 
company to provide its name, state of organization, form of 
organization, classification, the name and address of each investment 
adviser of the investment company, the current value of its total 
assets, and certain other information readily available to the 
investment company. If the investment company is filing a registration 
statement as required by Section 8(b) of the Investment Company Act 
concurrently with its notification of registration, Form N-8A requires 
only that the registrant file the cover page (giving its name, address, 
and agent for service of process) and sign the form in order to effect 
registration.
    Based on recent filings of notifications of registration on Form N-
8A, we estimate that about 99 investment companies file such 
notifications each year. An investment company must only file a 
notification of registration on Form N-8A once. The currently approved 
average hour burden per investment company of preparing and filing a 
notification of registration on Form N-8A is one hour. Based on the 
Commission staff's experience with the requirements of Form N-8A and 
with disclosure documents generally--and considering that investment 
companies that are filing notifications of registration on Form N-8A 
simultaneously with the registration statement under the Investment 
Company Act are only required by Form N-8A to file a signed cover 
page--we continue to believe that this estimate is appropriate. 
Therefore, we estimate that the total annual hour burden to prepare and 
file notifications of registration on Form N-8A is 99 hours. The 
currently approved cost burden of Form N-8A is $496. We are updating 
the estimated costs burden to $562 to account for the effects of 
inflation. Therefore, we estimate that the total annual cost burden 
associated with preparing and filing notifications of registration on 
Form N-8A is about $55,638.
    Estimates of average burden hours and costs are made solely for the 
purposes of the Paperwork Reduction Act, and are not derived from a 
comprehensive or even representative survey or study of the costs of 
Commission rules and forms. Compliance with the collection of 
information requirements of Form N-8A is mandatory. Responses to the 
collection of information will not be kept confidential. An agency may 
not conduct or sponsor, and a person is not required to respond to, a 
collection of information unless it displays a currently valid OMB 
control number.
    Written comments are invited on: (a) whether the proposed 
collection of information is necessary for the proper performance of 
the functions of the Commission, including whether the information 
shall have practical utility; (b) the accuracy of the Commission's 
estimate of the burden of the collection of information; (c) ways to 
enhance the quality, utility, and clarity of the information collected; 
and (d) ways to minimize the burden of the collection of information on 
respondents, including through the use of automated collection 
techniques or other forms of information technology. Consideration will 
be given to comments and suggestions submitted by February 10, 2025.
    An agency may not conduct or sponsor, and a person is not required 
to respond to, a collection of information under the PRA unless it 
displays a currently valid OMB control number.

Chief Data Officer, Securities and Exchange Commission, c/o Tanya 
Ruttenberg, 100 F Street NE, Washington, DC 20549 or send an email to:
