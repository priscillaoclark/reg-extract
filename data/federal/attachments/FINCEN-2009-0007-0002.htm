    Inspection of Comments: Public comments received electronically or 
through the U.S. Postal Service sent in response to a ``Notice and 
Request for Comment'' will be made available for public review as soon

SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION: FinCEN issued a notice of proposed 
rulemaking (75 FR 36589) on June 28, 2010 proposing to revise the Bank 
Secrecy Act (``BSA'') regulations applicable to Money Services 
Businesses with regard to stored value or prepaid access. More 
specifically, the proposed changes include the following: renaming 
``stored value'' as ``prepaid access'' and defining that term; deleting 
the terms ``issuer and redeemer'' of stored value; imposing suspicious 
activity reporting, customer information and transaction information 
recordkeeping requirements on both providers and sellers of prepaid 
access and, additionally, imposing a registration requirement on 
providers only; and exempting certain categories of prepaid access 
products and services posing lower risks of money laundering and 
terrorist financing from certain requirements.
    We have received a number of comments to date, including a request 
to extend the deadline for comments in order to allow interested 
parties more time in which to comment on the proposals in the notice.
    In light of the fact that an extension of time will not impede any 
imminent rulemaking and will allow additional interested parties to 
respond to the issues raised in the advance notice, we have determined 
that it is appropriate to extend the comment period until August 27, 
2010.

    Dated: July 13, 2010.
Charles M. Steele,
Deputy Director, Financial Crimes Enforcement Network.
