Section 3506(c)(2)(A) of the PRA, 44 U.S.C. 3506(c)(2)(A), requires

the CFTC is publishing notice of the proposed collection of information 
listed below.

    Title: Market Surveys (OMB Control No. 3038-0017). This is a 
request for extension of a currently approved information collection.
    Abstract: Under Commission Rule 21.02, 17 CFR 21.02, upon call by 
the Commission, information must be furnished related to futures or 
options positions held or introduced by futures commission merchants, 
members of contract markets, introducing brokers, foreign brokers, and 
for options positions, by each reporting market. This rule is designed 
to assist the Commission in prevention of market manipulation and is 
promulgated pursuant to the Commission's rulemaking authority contained 
in section 8a of the Commodity Exchange Act, 7 U.S.C. 12a (2010). An 
agency may not conduct or sponsor, and a person is not required to 
respond to, a collection of information unless it displays a currently 
valid OMB control number.
    With respect to the collection of information, the CFTC invites 
comments on:
    <bullet> Whether the proposed collection of information is 
necessary for the proper performance of the functions of the 
Commission, including whether the information will have a practical 
use;
    <bullet> The accuracy of the Commission's estimate of the burden of 
the proposed collection of information, including the validity of the 
methodology and assumptions used;
    <bullet> Ways to enhance the quality, usefulness, and clarity of 
the information to be collected; and
    <bullet> Ways to minimize the burden of collection of information 
on those who are to respond, including through the use of appropriate 
automated electronic, mechanical, or other technological collection 
techniques or other forms of information technology; e.g., permitting 
electronic submission of responses.
    You should submit only information that you wish to make available 
publicly. If you wish the Commission to consider information that you 
believe is exempt from disclosure under the Freedom of Information Act, 
a petition for confidential treatment of the exempt information may be 
submitted according to the procedures established in Sec.  145.9 of the 
Commission's regulations.\2\

    The Commission reserves the right, but shall have no obligation, to 
review, pre-screen, filter, redact, refuse or remove any or all of your 
submission from <a href="https://www.cftc.gov">https://www.cftc.gov</a> that it may deem to be 
inappropriate for publication, such as obscene language. All 
submissions that have been redacted or removed that contain comments on 
the merits of the Information Collection Request will be retained in 
the public comment file and will be considered as required under the 
Administrative Procedure Act and other applicable
