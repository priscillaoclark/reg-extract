SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION: Under the PRA, Federal agencies must obtain 
approval from the Office of Management and Budget (``OMB'') for each 
collection of information the agency conducts or sponsors. ``Collection 
of Information'' is defined in 44 U.S.C. 3502(3) and 5 CFR 1320.3(c) 
and includes agency requests or requirements that members of the public 
submit reports, keep records, or provide information to a third party. 
Section 3506(c)(2)(A) of the PRA, 44 U.S.C. 3506(c)(2)(A), requires 
Federal agencies to provide a 60-day notice in the Federal Register 
concerning each proposed collection of information, including each 
proposed extension of an existing collection of information, before 
submitting the collection to OMB for approval. To comply with this 
requirement, the CFTC is publishing notice of the proposed collection 
of information listed below.\1\
---------------------------------------------------------------------------

    \1\ An agency may not conduct or sponsor, and a person is not 
required to respond to, a collection of information unless it 
displays a currently valid OMB control number. 44 U.S.C. 3512, 5 CFR 
1320.5(b)(2)(i) and 1320.8(b)(3)(vi).
---------------------------------------------------------------------------

    With respect to the following collection of information, the CFTC 
invites comments on:
    <bullet> Whether the proposed collection of information is 
necessary for the proper performance of the functions of the 
Commission, including whether the information will have a practical 
use;
    <bullet> The accuracy of the Commission's estimate of the burden of 
the proposed collection of information, including the validity of the 
methodology and assumptions used;
    <bullet> Ways to enhance the quality, usefulness, and clarity of 
the information to be collected; and
    <bullet> Ways to minimize the burden of collection of information 
on those who choose to respond, including through the use of 
appropriate automated electronic, mechanical, or other technological 
collection techniques or other forms of information technology; e.g., 
permitting electronic submission of responses.
    Title: The Whistleblower Provision of Section 23 of the Commodity 
Exchange Act (``CEA''), OMB Control Number 3038-0082. This is a request 
for extension of a currently approved information collection.
    Abstract: 17 CFR 165.3(a) requires the submission of information to 
the Commission on a Form TCR. The Form TCR, ``Tip, Complaint, or 
Referral,'' and the instructions thereto, are designed to capture basic 
identifying information about a complainant and elicit sufficient 
information to determine whether the conduct alleged suggests a 
violation of the Commodity Exchange Act. 17 CFR 165.7(b)(1) requires 
the submission of information to the Commission on a Form WB-APP. The 
Form WB-APP, ``Application for Award for Original Information Provided 
Pursuant to Section 23 of the Commodity Exchange Act,'' and the 
instructions thereto, are designed to elicit sufficient information to 
determine whether and to what extent a claimant qualifies for a 
whistleblower award.
    You should submit only information that you wish to make available 
publicly. If you wish the Commission to consider information that you 
believe is exempt from disclosure under the Freedom of Information Act, 
a petition for confidential treatment of the exempt information may be 
submitted according

[[Page 81065]]

to the procedures established in Sec.  145.9 of the Commission's 
regulations.\2\
---------------------------------------------------------------------------

    \2\ 17 CFR 145.9.
---------------------------------------------------------------------------

    The Commission reserves the right, but shall have no obligation, to 
review, pre-screen, filter, redact, refuse or remove any or all of your 
submission from <a href="https://www.cftc.gov">https://www.cftc.gov</a> that it may deem to be 
inappropriate for publication, such as obscene language. All 
submissions that have been redacted or removed that contain comments on 
the merits of the Information Collection Review will be retained in the 
public comment file and will be considered as required under the 
Administrative Procedure Act and other applicable laws, and may be 
accessible under the Freedom of Information Act.
    Burden Statement: The respondent burden for this collection is 
estimated to be 0.5 hours per response.
    <bullet> Respondents/Affected Entities: Individuals.
    <bullet> Estimated number of respondents: 1800 per year.
    <bullet> Estimated total annual burden on respondents: 900 hours.
    <bullet> Frequency of collection: Once.
    There are no capital costs or operating and maintenance costs 
associated with this collection.

    (Authority: 44 U.S.C. 3501 et seq.)

    Dated: November 16, 2023.
Robert Sidman,
Deputy Secretary of the Commission.
