SECURITIES AND EXCHANGE COMMISSION

[SEC File No. 270-668, OMB Control No. 3235-0751]


Submission for OMB Review; Comment Request; Extension: Rule 18a-6

Upon Written Request, Copies Available From: Securities and Exchange 
Commission, Office of FOIA Services, 100 F Street NE, Washington, DC 
20549-2736

    Notice is hereby given that, pursuant to the Paperwork Reduction 
Act of 1995 (44 U.S.C. 3501 et seq.), the Securities and Exchange 
Commission (``Commission'') has submitted to the Office of Management 
and Budget (``OMB'') a request for extension of the previously approved 
collection of information discussed below.
    Rule 18a-6, which is modeled on Rule 17a-4, establishes record 
maintenance and preservation requirements for stand-alone and bank 
security-based swap dealers (``SBSDs'') and major security-based swap 
participants (``MSBSPs'') (collectively, ``SBS entities''). 
Specifically, Rule 18a-6 prescribes the period of time the records 
required to be made and kept current under Rule 18a-5 must be preserved 
by stand-alone SBSDs and MSBSPs and the manner in which the records 
must be preserved. Rule 18a-6 also identifies additional types of 
records that must be preserved (e.g., written communications and 
agreements relating to the firm's business) if the record is made or 
received by the SBS entity.
    The Commission estimates that the total hour burden under Rule 18a-
6 is approximately 15,626 burden hours per year, and the total cost 
burden is approximately $1,349,098 per year. Since the last approval of 
this information collection, the estimated total burden hours per year 
has decreased due to a decrease in the number of respondents subject to 
the requirements of the Rule. The estimated total cost burden per year, 
however, increased due to changes in the number of respondents with 
respect to certain provisions of Rule 18a-6.
    An agency may not conduct or sponsor, and a person is not required 
to respond to, a collection of information under the PRA unless it 
displays a currently valid OMB control number.
    The public may view background documentation for this information 
collection at the following website: <a href="http://www.reginfo.gov">www.reginfo.gov</a>. Find this 
particular information collection by selecting ``Currently under 30-day 
Review--Open for Public Comments'' or by using the search function. 
Written comments and recommendations for the proposed information 
collection should be sent by June 24, 2024 to (i) <a href="http://www.reginfo.gov/public/do/PRAMain">www.reginfo.gov/public/do/PRAMain</a> and (ii) David Bottom, Director/Chief Information 
Officer, Securities and Exchange Commission, c/o John Pezzullo, 100 F 
Street NE, Washington, DC 20549, or by sending an email to:

    Dated: May 20, 2024.
Sherry R. Haywood,
Assistant Secretary.
