I. Self-Regulatory Organization's Statement of the Terms of Substance 
of the Proposed Rule Change

    The Exchange proposes to amend the Connectivity Fee Schedule (``Fee 
Schedule'') to make clarifying changes with respect to the wireless 
connections to third party data in co-location. The proposed rule 
change is available on the Exchange's website at <a href="http://www.nyse.com">www.nyse.com</a>, at the 
principal office of the Exchange, and at the Commission's Public 
Reference Room.

II. Self-Regulatory Organization's Statement of the Purpose of, and 
Statutory Basis for, the Proposed Rule Change

    In its filing with the Commission, the self-regulatory organization 
included statements concerning the purpose of, and basis for, the 
proposed rule change and discussed any comments it received on the 
proposed rule change. The text of those statements may be examined at 
the places specified in Item IV below. The Exchange has prepared 
summaries, set forth in sections A, B, and C below, of the most 
significant parts of such statements.

A. Self-Regulatory Organization's Statement of the Purpose of, and the 
Statutory Basis for, the Proposed Rule Change

1. Purpose
    The Exchange proposes to amend the Fee Schedule to make clarifying 
changes with respect to the wireless connections to third party data in 
co-location.
    The Exchange currently provides Users \4\ with wireless connections 
to ten market data feeds or combinations of feeds from third-party 
markets (the ``Existing Third Party Data'').\5\
---------------------------------------------------------------------------

    \4\ For purposes of the Exchange's colocation services, a 
``User'' means any market participant that requests to receive 
colocation services directly from the Exchange. See Securities 
Exchange Act Release No. 76008 (September 29, 2015), 80 FR 60190 
(October 5, 2015) (SR-NYSE-2015-40). As specified in the Fee 
Schedule, a User that incurs colocation fees for a particular 
colocation service pursuant thereto would not be subject to 
colocation fees for the same colocation service charged by the 
Exchange's affiliates NYSE American LLC, NYSE Arca, Inc., NYSE 
Chicago, Inc., and NYSE National, Inc. (together, the ``Affiliate 
SROs''). Each Affiliate SRO has submitted substantially the same 
proposed rule change to propose the changes described herein. See 
SR-NYSEAMER-2024-33, SR-NYSEARCA-2024-42, SR-NYSECHX-2024-19, and 
SR-NYSENAT-2024-16.
    \5\ See Securities Exchange Act Release No. 99806 (March 20. 
2024), 89 FR 21055 (March 26, 2024) (SR-NYSE-2024-15).
---------------------------------------------------------------------------

    The Exchange recently filed to provide wireless connection to MEMX 
Memoir Depth market data feed (``MEMX Data''), noting that the wireless 
connection to MEMX Data would lead to the data center pole.\6\ For all 
the Existing Third Party Data that leads to that pole,\7\ the monthly 
charge for wireless connections is subject to a 30-day testing period, 
during which the monthly charge per connection would be waived. 
Consistent with that fact, the Exchange proposes to amend the Fee 
Schedule to clarify that this provision is applicable to wireless 
connections to MEMX Data.
---------------------------------------------------------------------------

    \6\ See id.
    \7\ See Securities Exchange Act Release No. 76748 (December 23, 
2015), 80 FR 81609 (December 30, 2015) (SR-NYSE-2015-52).
---------------------------------------------------------------------------

    In addition, the Exchange proposes to make the following non-
substantive changes to the Fee Schedule:
    <bullet> Move the existing service for a wireless connection of 
NASDAQ BX-Totalview-ITCH data to place the wireless connections in 
alphabetical order.
    <bullet> To conform to the corporate branding of Nasdaq, amend 
``NASDAQ'' to ``Nasdaq'' and delete ``OMX'' and ``Ultra'' throughout 
the Fee Schedule.\8\
---------------------------------------------------------------------------

    \8\ See Securities Exchange Act Release No. 801917 (October 23, 
2017), 82 FR 49879 (October 27, 2017) (SR-NASDAQ-2017-111). See also 
<a href="https://www.nasdaq.com/solutions/nasdaq-canada">https://www.nasdaq.com/solutions/nasdaq-canada</a>, and <a href="https://www.nasdaq.com/solutions/nasdaq-ise">https://www.nasdaq.com/solutions/nasdaq-ise</a>.
---------------------------------------------------------------------------

    <bullet> To conform to Nasdaq's usage of the term, amend 
``Totalview'' to ``TotalView'' in the Existing Third Party Services.\9\
---------------------------------------------------------------------------

    \9\ See <a href="https://www.nasdaqtrader.com/Trader.aspx?id=DPUSdata">https://www.nasdaqtrader.com/Trader.aspx?id=DPUSdata</a>.
---------------------------------------------------------------------------

    These changes are typographical in nature and are not intended to 
change the substance or meaning of the Fee Schedule.
    The proposed changes would not apply differently to distinct types 
or sizes of market participants. Rather, they would apply to all Users 
equally. As is currently the case, the purchase of any colocation 
service is completely voluntary and the Fee Schedule is applied 
uniformly to all Users.
    The Exchange does not believe that it would obtain any new 
customers due to the proposed change.
    The proposed change is not otherwise intended to address any other 
issues relating to colocation services or related fees, and the 
Exchange is not aware of any problems that Users would have in 
complying with the proposed change.
Timing and Implementation
    The proposed change to the Fee Schedule to clarify the provisions 
regarding the MEMX Memoir Depth market feed would become operative when 
the wireless connection to MEMX Memoir Depth market data feed becomes 
operative. The Exchange expects that to be no later than the third 
quarter of 2024.
2. Statutory Basis
    The Exchange believes that the proposed rule change is consistent 
with section 6(b) of the Act,\10\ in general, and furthers the 
objectives of section 6(b)(5) of the Act,\11\ in particular, because it 
is designed to prevent fraudulent and manipulative acts and practices, 
to promote just and equitable principles of trade, to foster 
cooperation and coordination with persons engaged in regulating, 
clearing, settling, processing information with respect to, and 
facilitating transactions in securities, to remove impediments to and 
perfect the mechanism of a free and open market and a national market 
system, and, in general, to protect investors and the public interest 
and because it is not designed to permit unfair discrimination between 
customers, issuers, brokers, or dealers. The Exchange further believes 
that the proposed rule change is consistent with section 6(b)(4) of the 
Act,\12\ because it provides for the equitable allocation of reasonable 
dues, fees, and other charges among its members and issuers and other 
persons using its facilities and does not unfairly discriminate between 
customers, issuers, brokers, or dealers.

    \12\ 15 U.S.C. 78f(b)(4).
---------------------------------------------------------------------------

    The Exchange believes that the proposed changes would remove 
impediments to and perfect the mechanism of a free and open market and 
a national market system, and, in general, protect investors and the 
public interest. With respect to the wireless connection to MEMX Memoir 
Depth data, the proposed change simply would clarify that the terms on 
which it is offered are the same as those of the Existing Third Party 
Data feeds that also connect to the data center pole. With respect to 
the other changes, putting the existing services in alphabetical order 
and conforming the descriptions to Nasdaq's usage would make the Fee 
Schedule easier to read, understand, and administer, alleviating any 
possible market participant confusion.

dealers. The proposed rule change would clarify that the terms under 
which the wireless connection to the MEMX Memoir Depth data is offered 
are the same as those of the Existing Third Party Data feeds that also

With respect to the other changes, putting the existing services in 
alphabetical order and conforming the descriptions to Nasdaq's usage 
would make the Fee Schedule easier to read, understand, and administer, 
alleviating any possible market participant confusion. The proposed 
changes would not alter any of the fees charged.

B. Self-Regulatory Organization's Statement on Burden on Competition

    The Exchange believes that the proposal will not impose any burden 
on competition that is not necessary or appropriate in furtherance of 
the purposes of section 6(b)(8) of the Act.\13\
---------------------------------------------------------------------------

    \13\ 15 U.S.C. 78f(b)(8).
---------------------------------------------------------------------------

    The proposed change would not affect competition among national 
securities exchanges or among members of the Exchange. The proposed 
rule change is not designed to address any competitive issues but 
rather to enhance the clarity and transparency of the Fee Schedule and 
alleviate possible customer confusion that may arise. The proposed rule 
change would have no impact on pricing or existing services. Rather, 
the changes would clarify the Fee Schedule, making it easier to 
understand and alleviating any possible market participant confusion.

C. Self-Regulatory Organization's Statement on Comments on the Proposed 
Rule Change Received From Members, Participants, or Others

    No written comments were solicited or received with respect to the 
proposed rule change.

III. Date of Effectiveness of the Proposed Rule Change and Timing for 
Commission Action

    The Exchange has filed the proposed rule change pursuant to section 
19(b)(3)(A)(iii) of the Act \14\ and Rule 19b-4(f)(6) thereunder.\15\ 
Because the proposed rule change does not: (i) significantly affect the 
protection of investors or the public interest; (ii) impose any 
significant burden on competition; and (iii) become operative prior to 
30 days from the date on which it was filed, or such shorter time as 
the Commission may designate, if consistent with the protection of 
investors and the public interest, the proposed rule change has become 
effective pursuant to section 19(b)(3)(A) of the Act and Rule 19b-
4(f)(6)(iii) thereunder.\16\
---------------------------------------------------------------------------

    \14\ 15 U.S.C. 78s(b)(3)(A)(iii).
    \15\ 17 CFR 240.19b-4(f)(6).
    \16\ 17 CFR 240.19b-4(f)(6)(iii). In addition, Rule 19b-4(f)(6) 
requires a self-regulatory organization to give the Commission 
written notice of its intent to file the proposed rule change at 
least five business days prior to the date of filing of the proposed 
rule change, or such shorter time as designated by the Commission. 
The Exchange has satisfied this requirement.
---------------------------------------------------------------------------

    A proposed rule change filed under Rule 19b-4(f)(6) \17\ normally 
does not become operative prior to 30 days after the date of the 
filing. However, pursuant to Rule 19b4(f)(6)(iii),\18\ the Commission 
may designate a shorter time if such action is consistent with the 
protection of investors and the public interest. The Exchange has asked 
the Commission to waive the 30-day operative delay so that the proposal 
may become operative immediately upon filing.
---------------------------------------------------------------------------

    \17\ 17 CFR 240.19b-4(f)(6).
    \18\ 17 CFR 240.19b-4(f)(6)(iii).
---------------------------------------------------------------------------

    The Commission agrees with the Exchange that waiver of the 30-day 
operative delay would be consistent with the protection of investors 
and the public interest because it would allow the Exchange to 
implement this proposed change immediately, ensuring that Users could 
benefit from the 30-day testing period for the existing service for a 
wireless connection of MEMX Memoir Depth data. Investors and the public 
interest would also benefit from the increased clarity and transparency 
the other amendments would provide to the Fee Schedule. The Commission 
therefore believes that waiver of the 30-day operative delay is 
appropriate.
    At any time within 60 days of the filing of such proposed rule 
change, the Commission summarily may temporarily suspend such rule 
change if it appears to the Commission that such action is necessary or 
appropriate in the public interest, for the protection of investors, or 
otherwise in furtherance of the purposes of the Act. If the Commission 
takes such action, the Commission shall institute proceedings under 
section 19(b)(2)(B) \19\ of the Act to determine whether the proposed 
rule change should be approved or disapproved.
