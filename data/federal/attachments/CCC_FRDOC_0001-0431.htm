Domestic Sugar Program--Overall Sugar Marketing Allotment, Cane 
Sugar and Beet Sugar Marketing Allotments and Company Allocations

AGENCY: Commodity Credit Corporation, USDA.

ACTION: Notice.

-----------------------------------------------------------------------

SUMMARY: The United States Department of Agriculture (USDA) is issuing 
this notice to announce the fiscal year (FY) 2023 (2022 crop year) 
overall sugar marketing allotment quantity (OAQ), State cane sugar 
allotments, and sugar beet and sugarcane processor allocations, which 
apply to all domestic beet and cane sugar marketed for human 
consumption in the United States from October 1, 2022, through 
September 30, 2023.

FOR FURTHER INFORMATION CONTACT: Kent Lanclos, telephone, (202) 720-
0114; or email, <a href="/cdn-cgi/l/email-protection#6d0608031943010c030e01021e2d181e090c430a021b"><span class="__cf_email__" data-cfemail="bfd4dad1cb91d3ded1dcd3d0ccffcaccdbde91d8d0c9">[email&#160;protected]</span></a>. Persons with disabilities who 
require alternative means for communication should contact the USDA 
Target Center at (202) 720-2600 (voice).

SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION: The Agricultural Adjustment Act of 1938, as 
amended, requires USDA to establish the OAQ at a quantity not less than 
85 percent of the estimated quantity of sugar for domestic human 
consumption for the crop year. USDA is establishing the initial FY 2023 
(2022 crop year) OAQ at 10,646,250 short tons, raw value (STRV), which 
is equal to 85 percent of 12,525,000 STRV, the estimated quantity of 
sugar for domestic human consumption for FY 2023 as forecast in the 
September 2022 World Agricultural Supply and Demand Estimates report. 
The Agricultural Adjustment Act of 1938, as amended, requires that 
54.35 percent of the OAQ be distributed among beet processors and 45.65 
percent be distributed among the sugarcane States and cane processors. 
The beet and cane sector allotments are distributed to individual 
processors according to formulas set out in law.\1\ Although the 
Agricultural Adjustment Act of 1938, as amended directs USDA to assign 
325,000 STRV of the cane sector allotment to ``offshore States,'' CCC 
has determined that no offshore States exist. While sugar cane was 
formerly produced in Puerto Rico and Hawaii, CCC has determined that 
both states have permanently exited sugarcane production. As a result, 
CCC

[[Page 59391]]

has allocated the 325,000 STRV of the cane sector allotment previously 
reserved for offshore States to the mainland sugarcane producing 
States. The initial FY 2023 sugar marketing State allotments and 
processor allocations are listed in the table below.
