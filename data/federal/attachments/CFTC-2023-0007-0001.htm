SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION:
    Title: Privacy of Consumer Financial Information (OMB Control No. 
3038-0055). This is a request for an extension of a currently approved 
information collection.
    Abstract: Section 124 of the Commodity Futures Modernization Act of 
2000 \2\ amended the Commodity Exchange Act (the ``Act'') and added a 
new Section 5g \3\ to the Act to (i) provide that futures commission 
merchants, commodity trading advisors, commodity pool operators, and 
introducing brokers that are subject to CFTC jurisdiction with respect 
to any financial activity shall be treated as a financial institution 
for purposes of Title V, Subtitle A of the Gramm-Leach-Bliley Act 
(``GLB Act''), (ii) treat the Commission as a Federal functional 
regulator for purposes of applying the provisions of the GLB Act, and 
(iii) direct the Commission to prescribe regulations under Title V of 
the GLB Act. The Commission adopted regulations for these entities 
under part 160 and later extended them to retail foreign exchange 
dealers, swap dealers, and major swap participants.\4\ Part 160 
requires those subject to the regulations, among other things, to 
provide privacy and opt out notices to customers and to adopt 
appropriate policies and procedures to safeguard customer records and 
information. In April 2019, the Commission adopted amendments to its 
regulations to provide an exception to its annual privacy notice 
requirement under certain conditions.\5\
