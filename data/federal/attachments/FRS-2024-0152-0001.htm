SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION: On June 15, 1984, OMB delegated to the Board 
authority under the Paperwork Reduction Act (PRA) to approve and assign 
OMB control numbers to collections of information conducted or 
sponsored by the Board. In exercising this delegated authority, the 
Board is directed to take every reasonable step to solicit comment. In 
determining whether to approve a collection of information, the Board 
will consider all comments received from the public and other agencies.
    During the comment period for this proposal, a copy of the proposed 
PRA OMB submission, including the draft reporting form and 
instructions, supporting statement (which contains more detail about 
the information collection and burden estimates than this notice), and 
other documentation, will be made available on the Board's public 
website at <a href="https://www.federalreserve.gov/apps/reportingforms/home/review">https://www.federalreserve.gov/apps/reportingforms/home/review</a> or may be requested from the agency clearance officer, whose 
name appears above. Final versions of these documents will be made 
available at <a href="https://www.reginfo.gov/public/do/PRAMain">https://www.reginfo.gov/public/do/PRAMain</a>, if approved.

Request for Comment on Information Collection Proposal

    The Board invites public comment on the following information 
collection, which is being reviewed under authority delegated by the 
OMB under the PRA. Comments are invited on the following:
    a. Whether the proposed collection of information is necessary for 
the proper performance of the Board's functions, including whether the 
information has practical utility;
    b. The accuracy of the Board's estimate of the burden of the 
proposed information collection, including the validity of the 
methodology and assumptions used;
    c. Ways to enhance the quality, utility, and clarity of the 
information to be collected;
    d. Ways to minimize the burden of information collection on 
respondents, including through the use of automated collection 
techniques or other forms of information technology; and
    e. Estimates of capital or startup costs and costs of operation, 
maintenance, and purchase of services to provide information.
    At the end of the comment period, the comments and recommendations 
received will be analyzed to determine the extent to which the Board 
should modify the proposal.

Proposal Under OMB Delegated Authority To Extend for Three Years, With 
Revision, the Following Information Collection

    Collection title: Financial Statements for Holding Companies.
    Collection identifier: FR Y-9 reports.
    OMB control number: 7100-0128.
    General description of collection: The Board requires bank holding 
companies, most savings and loan holding companies, securities holding 
companies, and U.S. intermediate holding companies (collectively, HCs) 
to provide standardized financial statements through one or more of the 
FR Y-9 reports. The information collected on the FR Y-9 reports is 
necessary for the Board to identify emerging financial risks and 
monitor the safety and soundness of HC operations.
    The Consolidated Financial Statements for Holding Companies (FR Y-
9C) consists of standardized financial statements for HCs similar to 
the Call Reports filed by commercial banks. The FR Y-9C collects 
consolidated data and is filed quarterly by top-tier HCs with total 
consolidated assets of $3 billion or more.
    The Parent Company Only Financial Statements for Large Holding 
Companies (FR Y-9LP), must be submitted quarterly by each HC that files 
the FR Y-9C, as well as by each of its subsidiary HCs. The report 
consists of standardized financial statements, including the following 
schedules: Income Statement, Cash Flow Statement, Balance Sheet, 
Investments in Subsidiaries and Associated Companies, Memoranda, and 
Notes to the Parent Company Only Financial Statements.
    The Parent Company Only Financial Statements for Small Holding 
Companies (FR Y-9SP), is filed semiannually by HCs with total 
consolidated assets of less than $3 billion. In a banking organization 
with total consolidated assets of less than $3 billion that has tiered 
HCs, each HC in the organization must submit, or have the top-tier HC 
submit on its behalf, a separate FR Y-9SP. This report collects basic 
balance sheet and income data for the parent company, as well as data 
on its intangible assets and intercompany transactions.
    The Financial Statements for Employee Stock Ownership Plan Holding 
Companies (FR Y-9ES) is filed annually by each employee stock ownership 
plan (ESOP) that is also an HC. The report collects financial data on 
the ESOP's benefit plan activities. The FR Y-9ES consists of four 
schedules: Statement of Changes in Net Assets Available for Benefits, 
Statement of Net Assets Available for Benefits, Memoranda, and Notes to 
the Financial Statements.
    The instructions to each of the FR Y-9C, FR Y-9LP, FR Y-9SP, and FR 
Y-9ES state that respondent HCs should retain workpapers and other 
records used in the preparation of the reports for a period of three 
years following submission. In addition, HCs must maintain in their 
files a manually signed and attested printout of the data submitted 
under each form for a period of three years.

[[Page 48639]]

    The Supplement to the Consolidated Financial Statements for Holding 
Companies (FR Y-9CS) is a voluntary, free-form supplemental report that 
the Board may utilize to collect critical additional data deemed to be 
needed from HCs in an expedited manner. The FR Y-9CS data collections 
are used to assess and monitor emerging issues related to HCs, and the 
report is intended to supplement the other FR Y-9 reports. The data 
requested by the FR Y-9CS would depend on the Board's data needs in any 
given situation. For example, changes made by the Financial Accounting 
Standards Board may introduce into generally accepted accounting 
principles new data items that are not currently collected by the other 
FR Y-9 reports. The Board could use the FR Y-9CS report to collect 
these data until the items are implemented into the other FR Y-9 
reports.
    Proposed revisions: The Board proposes to revise the FR Y-9C and FR 
Y-9LP to align with the definition of loan modifications to borrowers 
experiencing financial difficulty, as described in Accounting Standards 
Update 2022-02, ``Financial Instruments--Credit Losses (Topic 326): 
Troubled Debt Restructurings and Vintage Disclosures''. Additionally, 
the Board proposes to replace, as appropriate, references to ``troubled 
debt restructurings'' with ``modifications to borrowers experiencing 
financial difficulty'' in the FR Y-9C and FR Y-9LP. All of the proposed 
changes to the FR Y-9C and FR Y-9LP would take effect as of the 
December 31, 2024, report date. There are no proposed revisions at this 
time for the FR Y-9SP, FR Y-9ES, or FR Y-9CS.
    The Board invites comment on this proposal and acknowledges that 
this proposal to report ``loan modifications to borrowers experiencing 
financial difficulty'' may diverge from the proposed changes to the 
Call Report.\1\ Therefore, the Board is specifically interested in the 
following:
---------------------------------------------------------------------------

    \1\ See 88 FR 66933 (September 28, 2023)
---------------------------------------------------------------------------

    1. What challenges, if any, would HCs face if the FR Y-9C and FR Y-
9LP reporting definitions were out of sync with the Call Report?
    2. What challenges, if any, would HCs face if loan modifications to 
borrowers experiencing financial difficulty were reported on the FR Y-
9C and FR Y-9LP using a 12-month lookback, and different lookback 
criteria were used on the Call Report? If the Call Report used 
different lookback criteria, would it be preferable for the FR Y-9C and 
FR Y-9LP to adopt the same definition?
    Frequency: Quarterly, semiannual, annual, and as needed.
    Respondents: HCs.
    Total estimated number of respondents:
    Reporting: FR Y-9C (non-advanced approaches holding companies with 
less than $5 billion in total assets): 107; FR Y-9C (non-advanced

9ES: 73; FR Y-9CS: 236.
    Estimated average hours per response:
    Reporting: FR Y-9C (non-advanced approaches holding companies with 
less than $5 billion in total assets): 35.34; FR Y-9C (non-advanced 
approaches holding companies with $5 billion or more in total assets): 
44.54; FR Y-9C (advanced approaches holding companies): 49.76; FR Y-
9LP: 5.27; FR Y-9SP: 5.45; FR Y-9ES: 0.50; FR Y-9CS: 0.50.
    Recordkeeping: FR Y-9C: 1; FR Y-9LP: 1; FR Y-9SP: 0.50; FR Y-9ES: 
0.50; FR Y-9CS: 0.50.
    Total estimated change in burden: 0.
    Total estimated annual burden hours: 114,489.

    Board of Governors of the Federal Reserve System, June 4, 2024.
Benjamin W. McDonough,
Deputy Secretary and Ombuds of the Board.
