SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION:

Background

    On August 5, 2004, the governments of Costa Rica, the Dominican 
Republic, El Salvador, Guatemala, Honduras, Nicaragua, and the United 
States signed the Dominican Republic--Central America--United States 
Free Trade Agreement (``CAFTA-DR'' or ``Agreement'').
    The provisions of the CAFTA-DR were adopted by the United States 
with the enactment on August 2, 2005, of the Dominican Republic--
Central America--United States Free Trade Agreement Implementation Act 
(the ``Act''), Public Law 109-53, 119 Stat. 462 (19 U.S.C. 4001 et 
seq.). Section 210 of the Act requires that regulations be prescribed 
as necessary to implement these provisions of the CAFTA-DR.
    On June 13, 2008, CBP published CBP Dec. 08-22 in the Federal 
Register (73

[[Page 50696]]

FR 33673), setting forth interim amendments to implement the 
preferential tariff treatment and customs-related provisions of the 
CAFTA-DR. In order to provide transparency and facilitate their use, 
the majority of the CAFTA-DR implementing regulations set forth in CBP 
Dec. 08-22 were included within subpart J in part 10 of the CBP 
regulations (19 CFR subpart J, part 10). However, in those cases in 
which CAFTA-DR implementation was more appropriate in the context of an 
existing regulatory provision, the CAFTA-DR regulatory text was 
incorporated in an existing part within the CBP regulations.
    Although the interim regulatory amendments were promulgated without 
prior public notice and comment procedures and took effect on June 13, 
2008, CBP Dec. 08-22 provided for the submission of public comments 
that would be considered before adopting the interim regulations as a 
final rule. The prescribed public comment period closed on August 12, 
2008.

Discussion of Comment Received in Response to CBP Dec. 08-22

    Only one response was received to the solicitation of comments on 
the interim rule set forth in CBP Dec. 08-22. The points raised by the 
commenter are discussed below.
    Comment: The commenter referenced Sec.  10.584(a)(4) of the interim 
regulations which sets forth a statement that must be included as part 
of the certification on which an importer may rely in making a 
preference claim under the CAFTA-DR. In regard to the second sentence 
of the statement, concerning the maintenance and presentation of 
documentation in support of representations made in the certification, 
the commenter recommended that this language be amended to provide a 
time period within which the documentation must be maintained. The 
commenter recommends a time period of 18 months from the date of 
execution of the certification.
    CBP's Response: Section 10.587(a) of the CBP regulations, 
concerning the maintenance of records, implements Article 4.19.2 of the 
CAFTA-DR by providing that all records and documents that an importer 
has in support of a claim for preferential tariff treatment under the 
CAFTA-DR must be maintained for a minimum of five years after the date 
of importation. CBP believes it is unnecessary to repeat this time 
period for the retention of records in the statement set forth in Sec.  
10.584(a)(4).
    Comment: The commenter requested a clarification of Sec.  
10.584(f), which states that a properly completed, signed, and dated 
certification will be accepted as valid for four years following the 
date on which it was signed.
    CBP's Response: Section 10.584(f) reflects Article 4.16.5 of the 
CAFTA-DR which provides that the ``* * * certification shall be valid 
for four years after the date it was issued.'' CBP believes that this 
provision potentially impacts upon the acceptability of CAFTA-DR 
preference claims made by U.S. importers that are based on 
certifications. An importer may make such a claim based either on a 
certification or on the importer's knowledge that the good qualifies as 
an originating good. See Sec.  10.583(a). If the certification forms 
the basis for the claim, Sec.  10.584(a)(2) requires that the 
certification be in the possession of the importer at the time the 
claim is made. A certification will not be accepted as a valid basis 
for a preference claim if it predates the date of the claim by more 
than four years; however, it may serve as the basis for a new 
certification that would be acceptable.
    It should be noted that the four-year limitation on the validity of 
a certification will not be a factor in any subsequent verification by 
CBP of a CAFTA-DR preference claim, assuming that the claim was based 
on a properly completed and timely certification. For example, if CBP 
conducts a verification of a CAFTA-DR claim more than four years after 
the date of the certification upon which the claim was based, the fact 
that the four-year period has expired at that point will not serve as a 
basis for CBP to deny the claim. Again, this assumes that the 
certification was valid in all respects at the time the claim for 
preferential tariff treatment was made to CBP.
    Comment: The commenter asserted that Sec.  10.585(a)(1) and (a)(2) 
impose impossible obligations on the importer. These provisions state 
that an importer who makes a claim for preferential tariff treatment 
under the CAFTA-DR (1) will be deemed to have ``certified'' that the 
good is eligible for such treatment; and (2) is responsible for the 
truthfulness of the claim and the information in the certification. 
According to the commenter, unless the importer has conducted an audit 
of the producer's books and records, it cannot ``certify'' that the 
good is eligible for preference or attest to the truthfulness of the 
claim and the information in the certification. In this regard, the 
commenter noted that some producers may be reluctant to open their 
books and records to their customers, including U.S. importers.
    CBP's Response: CBP disagrees with the commenter's assertion that 
the importer should not be responsible for certifying that the goods 
are eligible for preference or for the truthfulness of the claim and 
the information in the certification. It is the responsibility of the 
U.S. importer of the goods for which preference is sought to file the 
appropriate entry with CBP and make the claim for preferential tariff 
treatment for the goods. In making this claim, the importer is 
responsible for exercising reasonable care to ensure that the goods are 
entitled to such treatment. CBP acknowledges that some producers may be 
reluctant to open their books to importers, but notes that an importer 
who has not acted fraudulently but nevertheless made an incorrect 
claim, is not subject to penalties if the importer promptly and 
voluntarily makes a corrected declaration and pays any duties owing. 
(19 CFR 10.585, 10.621, 10.623)
    Comment: The commenter objected to the requirement in Sec.  
10.587(a) that an importer claiming CAFTA-DR preference must maintain, 
for a minimum of five years after the date of importation, all records 
and documents that the importer has demonstrating that the goods 
qualify for such treatment. According to the commenter, it is not 
reasonable or necessary to require that the importer maintain non-entry 
type documents for a five year period. The commenter recommended that 
the five-year record retention requirement be limited only to the 
certification.
    CBP's Response: As previously indicated, Sec.  10.587(a) implements 
Article 4.19.2 of the CAFTA-DR which requires each Party to the 
Agreement to provide that an importer claiming preference under the 
Agreement for a good imported into its territory ``shall maintain, for 
a minimum of five years from the date of importation of the good, all 
records and documents necessary to demonstrate the good qualified for 
the preferential tariff treatment.'' CBP believes that adopting the 
commenter's recommended change to Sec.  10.587(a) would be contrary to 
the specific language of the CAFTA-DR set forth above.
    Comment: The commenter requested that CBP clarify in the preamble 
to this final rule document that the word ``transshipment'', as used in 
Sec. Sec.  10.588(b), 10.604, 10.609, and 10.610, is not intended to 
refer to ``illegal transshipment'', which is the meaning sometimes 
associated with term ``transshipment'' when used in the context of 
textile and apparel imports.
    CBP's Response: In the context in which the word ``transshipment'' 
is used

[[Page 50697]]

in the above-referenced provisions, CBP doubts that it would be 
misinterpreted as suggested by the commenter. However, to avoid any 
potential confusion in this regard, CBP confirms that the word 
``transshipment'', as used in the above-referenced provisions, is not 
intended to mean ``illegal transshipment''.
    Comment: The commenter recommended that, to avoid confusion, the 
heading ``Rules of Origin'' immediately preceding Sec.  10.593 be 
replaced with ``Preference Rules of Origin'' or some other similar 
wording.
    CBP's Response: CBP does not believe that the heading ``Rules of 
Origin'' requires any clarification in this context. The provisions set 
forth in subpart J, part 10 of the CBP regulations exclusively concern 
and implement the preferential tariff treatment provisions of the 
CAFTA-DR. Additionally, CBP notes that the same heading appears in the 
CBP regulations implementing a number of other free trade agreements 
(``FTAs''), including, for example, the United States-Chile Free Trade 
Agreement (see 19 CFR subpart H, part 10) and the United States-
Singapore Free Trade Agreement (see 19 CFR subpart I, part 10).
    Comment: The commenter referenced Sec.  10.617, which sets forth a 
special rule for verifications conducted in an exporting CAFTA-DR Party 
relating to textile and apparel goods imported into the United States. 
The commenter asked that CBP amend this section to require that the 
U.S. importer be notified when a request for a verification is made by 
CBP to the government of an exporting Party. According to the 
commenter, advising U.S. importers that such a request has been made 
will help to ensure that the foreign producer or exporter takes the 
inquiry seriously and provides the appropriate information without 
undue delay and confusion.
    CBP's Response: Section 10.617 implements Article 3.24 of the 
CAFTA-DR which sets forth detailed procedures for conducting 
verifications in an exporting CAFTA-DR Party at the request of the 
importing Party and does not require the notification requested by the 
commenter. However, we do note that Sec.  10.585 of the CBP regulations 
provides an importer the opportunity to arrange to have an exporter or 
producer provide to CBP any information relied upon in making a 
certification.

Changes to the Regulations

    The final rulemaking text set forth below incorporates the 
following changes which CBP believes are necessary as result of further 
internal review of the interim regulatory text:
    1. In Sec.  10.31, relating to temporary importations under bond, 
the last sentence in paragraph (f) has been revised to add Costa Rica 
to the list of countries. The CAFTA-DR entered into force with respect 
to Costa Rica on January 1, 2009 (see Presidential Proclamation 8331 
dated December 23, 2008, published in the Federal Register on December 
30, 2008 (73 FR 79585));
    2. In Sec.  10.582, the portion of the definition of ``Customs 
duty'' set forth in paragraph (d)(2) has been revised to correct an 
error by changing the first letter of the word ``Domestic'' from 
uppercase to lowercase;
    3. In Sec.  10.583, concerning the filing of a CAFTA-DR preference 
claim upon importation, the first sentence in paragraph (c) has been 
revised to replace the cross-reference to ``paragraph (a)'' with the 
correct cross-reference, ``paragraph (b)'';
    4. In Sec.  10.592, relating to the processing procedures for post-
importation duty refund claims:
    a. Paragraph (d)(1) has been revised to add a reference to ``Sec.  
10.588'' immediately preceding the second reference to ``Sec.  10.591'' 
to clarify that the failure of an importer to satisfy the requirements 
of Sec.  10.588 may be the basis for a denial of a post-importation 
duty refund claim; and
    b. Paragraph (d)(1) has been further revised to remove the words 
``initiation of'' in the phrase ``following initiation of an origin 
verification'' to more accurately reflect when determinations are made 
by CBP based upon the results of origin verifications;
    5. In Sec.  10.593, which sets forth definitions relating to the 
rules of origin:
    a. The portion of the definition of ``Class of motor vehicles'' set 
forth in paragraph (b)(3) has been revised to remove the unnecessary 
word ``provided'' immediately preceding the words ``for the transport 
of''; and
    b. The definition of ``reasonably allocate'' in paragraph (p) has 
been revised to capitalize the first letter in each of the words 
``generally accepted accounting principles'', consistent with the 
manner in which those words appear in other provisions in 19 CFR 
subpart J, part 10 (see, for example, Sec. Sec.  10.593(e) and 
10.596(d));
    6. In Sec.  10.595, concerning the regional value content test, 
paragraph (d)(2) has been revised to capitalize the first letter in 
each of the words ``generally accepted accounting principles'', 
consistent with the manner in which those words are used elsewhere in 
19 CFR subpart J, part 10;
    7. In Sec.  10.598, which sets forth the de minimis rules and 
exceptions:
    a. Paragraph (c)(1)(ii) has been revised to update four of the 
HTSUS subheadings referenced in that paragraph: 5402.10.30, 5402.10.60, 
5402.41.10, and 5402.41.90. These subheadings, which encompass nylon 
filament yarns, were replaced by subheadings 5402.11.30, 5402.11.60, 
5402.45.10, and 5402.45.90, respectively (see Presidential Proclamation 
8097 dated December 27, 2006, published in the Federal Register on 
January 4, 2007 (72 FR 453)); and
    b. Paragraph (c)(3) has been revised to replace the first reference 
to the words ``group of fibers'' with ``fiber'' and to replace the 
words ``yarn, fabric, or group of fibers'' at the end of the paragraph 
with the word ``good''. These changes more closely conform this 
provision to the wording in section 203(f)(3)(C) of the Act;
    8. Section 10.606, concerning the filing of tariff preference level 
(TPL) claims for certain non-originating apparel goods, has been 
revised to reflect the addition of certain apparel articles that may be 
entitled to preferential tariff treatment under applicable TPLs (see 
Presidential Proclamation 8213 dated December 20, 2007, published in 
the Federal Register on December 27, 2007 (72 FR 73555), as modified by 
Presidential Proclamation 8272 dated June 30, 2008, published in the 
Federal Register on July 3, 2008 (73 FR 38297); and Presidential 
Proclamation 8331 of December 23, 2008, published in the Federal 
Register on December 30, 2008 (73 FR 79585));
    9. Section 10.607, which sets forth the apparel goods eligible for 
TPL claims, has been revised consistent with the updates described 
above in regard to Sec.  10.606;
    10. Section 10.608, concerning the submission of a certificate of 
eligibility in support of a TPL claim, has been revised to clarify that 
the certificate is required only in connection with TPL claims for 
certain qualifying apparel goods from Nicaragua;
    11. In Sec.  10.616, concerning verifications by CBP of CAFTA-DR 
preference claims:
    a. The introductory text of paragraph (a) has been revised to add a 
reference to ``Sec.  10.591'' immediately after the reference to 
``Sec.  10.583(b)'' to clarify that a post-importation duty refund 
claim may also be subject to a verification by the port director; and
    b. Paragraph (a)(4) has been revised to replace the word 
``Parties'' with the words '' United States and the exporting Party'', 
which more closely conform to the wording in Article 4.20.1(e) of the 
CAFTA-DR;

[[Page 50698]]

    12. In Sec.  10.617, which sets forth a special rule for 
verifications in an exporting Party relating to U.S. imports of textile 
and apparel goods, paragraph (b)(3)(ii) has been revised to correct an 
error by replacing the words ``to any to any'' with the words ``to 
any'';
    13. In Sec.  10.625, relating to the retroactive application of the 
CAFTA-DR for textile and apparel goods:
    a. The paragraph (b) introductory text has been revised to replace 
the words ``the date of the entry into force of the Agreement with 
respect to the last CAFTA-DR country'' with ``January 1, 2009'' to 
reflect the date on which the CAFTA-DR entered into force with respect 
to Costa Rica. Of the six foreign signatories to the CAFTA-DR, Costa 
Rica was the last country for which the Agreement entered into force;
    b. The paragraph (c) introductory text has been revised to replace 
the words ``within 90 days after the date of the entry into force of 
the Agreement for the last CAFTA-DR country'' with ``April 1, 2009'', 
consistent with the change discussed above in regard to paragraph (b); 
and
    c. Paragraph (d) has been revised to remove the definition of 
``last CAFTA-DR country'' in paragraph (d)(2) since those words no 
longer appear in Sec.  10.625 as a result of the changes to paragraphs 
(b) and (c). The definition of ``textile or apparel good'' in paragraph 
(d)(3) also has been removed as these words are already defined in 
Sec.  10.582, which sets forth general definitions for purposes of the 
CAFTA-DR;
    14. In Sec.  24.23, which concerns merchandise processing fees and 
exemptions from the application of those fees, paragraph (c)(9) has 
been revised to replace ``January 1, 2005'' with the correct date on 
which the CAFTA-DR first entered into effect, ``March 1, 2006'' (see 
Presidential Proclamation 7987 dated February 28, 2006, published in 
the Federal Register on March 2, 2006 (71 FR 10827)); and
    15. In Sec.  163.1, relating to recordkeeping requirements, 
paragraph (a)(2)(x) has been revised to correct an error by replacing 
``an'' with ``a''.

Conclusion

    Accordingly, based on the analysis of the comment received and the 
additional considerations discussed above, CBP believes that the 
interim regulations published as CBP Dec. 08-22 should be adopted as a 
final rule with certain changes as discussed above and as set forth 
below.

Executive Order 12866

    CBP has determined that this document is not a regulation or rule 
subject to the provisions of Executive Order 12866 of September 30, 
1993 (58 FR 51735, October 1993), because it pertains to a foreign 
affairs function of the United States and implements an international 
agreement and therefore is specifically exempted by section 3(d)(2) of 
Executive Order 12866.

Regulatory Flexibility Act

    CBP Dec. 08-22 was issued as an interim rule rather than a notice 
of proposed rulemaking because CBP had determined that the interim 
regulations involve a foreign affairs function of the United States 
pursuant to section 553(a)(1) of the Administrative Procedure Act. 
Because no notice of proposed rulemaking was required, the provisions 
of the Regulatory Flexibility Act, as amended (5 U.S.C. 601 et seq.), 
do not apply to this rulemaking. Accordingly, this final rule is not 
subject to the regulatory analysis requirements or other requirements 
of 5 U.S.C. 603 and 604.

Paperwork Reduction Act

    The collections of information in this final rule have previously 
been reviewed and approved by the Office of Management and Budget in 
accordance with the requirements of the Paperwork Reduction Act (44 
U.S.C. 3507) under control number 1651-0125.
    The collections of information in these regulations are in 
Sec. Sec.  10.583 and 10.584. This information is required in 
connection with claims for preferential tariff treatment under the 
CAFTA-DR and the Act and will be used by CBP to determine eligibility 
for tariff preference under the CAFTA-DR and the Act. The likely 
respondents are business organizations including importers, exporters, 
and manufacturers.
    The estimated average annual burden associated with the collection 
of information in this final rule is 0.2 hours per respondent or record 
keeper. Under the Paperwork Reduction Act, an agency may not conduct or 
sponsor, and a person is not required to respond to, a collection of 
information unless it displays a valid OMB control number.

Signing Authority

    This document is being issued in accordance with Sec.  0.1(a)(1) of 
the CBP regulations (19 CFR 0.1(a)(1)) pertaining to the authority of 
the Secretary of the Treasury (or his/her delegate) to approve 
regulations related to certain customs revenue functions.
