Proposed Rule Change To Adopt a Provision That the Exchange Will Not

pursuant to Section 19(b)(1) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 
(``Act'') \1\ and Rule 19b-4 thereunder,\2\ a proposed rule change to 
amend Sections 802.02 and 802.03 of the NYSE Listed Company Manual 
(``Manual'') to provide that the Exchange will not review a compliance 
plan submitted by a domestic or non-U.S. listed company that is 
determined to be below compliance with a continued listing standard 
unless the company has paid in full all outstanding listing or annual 
fees due to the Exchange and will immediately commence suspension and 
delisting procedures in accordance with Section 804.00 of the Manual if 
such fees are not paid in full by the plan submission deadline or, with 
respect to any unpaid fees that have become due and payable since the 
commencement of its plan period, if such fees are not paid in full at 
the time of any required periodic review of such plan. The proposed 
rule change was published for comment in the Federal Register on 
October 16, 2024.\3\ The Commission has received no comment letters on
