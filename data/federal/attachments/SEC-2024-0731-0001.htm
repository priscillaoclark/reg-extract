I. Self-Regulatory Organization's Statement of the Terms of Substance 
of the Proposed Rule Change

    The Exchange proposes to toestablish fees for the NYSE Arca 
Aggregated Lite data feed. The proposed rule change is available on the 
Exchange's website at <a href="http://www.nyse.com">www.nyse.com</a>, at the principal office of the 
Exchange, and at the Commission's Public Reference Room.

II. Self-Regulatory Organization's Statement of the Purpose of, and 
Statutory Basis for, the Proposed Rule Change

    In its filing with the Commission, the self-regulatory organization 
included statements concerning the purpose of, and basis for, the 
proposed rule change and discussed any comments it received on the 
proposed rule change. The text of those statements may be examined at 
the places specified in Item IV below. The Exchange has prepared 
summaries, set forth in sections A, B, and C below, of the most 
significant parts of such statements.

A. Self-Regulatory Organization's Statement of the Purpose of, and the 
Statutory Basis for, the Proposed Rule Change

1. Purpose
    The Exchange proposes to amend the NYSE Arca Equities Proprietary 
Market Data Fees Schedule (``Fee Schedule'') and establish fees for the 
NYSE Arca Aggregated Lite (``NYSE Arca Agg Lite'') data feed that would 
be effective May 13, 2024.\4\
---------------------------------------------------------------------------

    \4\ The proposed rule change establishing the NYSE Arca Agg Lite 
data feed was immediately effective on February 27, 2024. See 
Securities Exchange Act Release No. 99713 (March 12, 2024), 89 FR 
19381 (March 18, 2024) (SR-NYSEARCA-2024-22) (Notice of Filing and 
Immediate Effectiveness of Proposed Rule Change To Establish the 
NYSE Arca Aggregated Lite Market Data Feed).
---------------------------------------------------------------------------

    In summary, the NYSE Arca Agg Lite is a NYSE Arca-only frequency-
based depth of book market data feed of the NYSE Arca's limit order 
book for up to ten (10) price levels on both the bid and offer sides of 
the order book for securities traded on the Exchange and for which the 
Exchange reports quotes and trades under the Consolidated Tape 
Association (``CTA'') Plan or the Nasdaq/UTP Plan. The NYSE Arca Agg 
Lite is a compilation of limit order data that the Exchange provides to 
vendors and subscribers. The NYSE Arca Agg Lite includes depth of book 
order data as well as security status messages. The security status 
message informs subscribers of changes in the status of a specific 
security, such as trading halts, short sale restriction, etc. In 
addition, the NYSE Arca Agg Lite includes order imbalance information 
prior to the opening and closing of trading.
Background
    The Exchange operates in a highly competitive market. The 
Commission has repeatedly expressed its preference for competition over 
regulatory intervention in determining prices, products, and services 
in the securities markets. In Regulation NMS, the Commission 
highlighted the importance of market forces in determining prices and 
SRO revenues and, also, recognized that current regulation of the 
market system ``has been remarkably successful in promoting market 
competition in its broader forms that are most important to investors 
and listed companies.'' \5\
---------------------------------------------------------------------------

    \5\ See Securities Exchange Act Release No. 51808 (June 9, 
2005), 70 FR 37496, 37499 (June 29, 2005) (File No. S7-10-04) (Final 
Rule) (``Regulation NMS'').
---------------------------------------------------------------------------

    While Regulation NMS has enhanced competition, it has also fostered 
a ``fragmented'' market structure where trading in a single stock can 
occur across multiple trading centers. When multiple trading centers 
compete for order flow in the same stock, the Commission has recognized 
that ``such competition can lead to the fragmentation of order flow in 
that stock.'' \6\ Indeed, cash equity trading is currently dispersed 
across 16 exchanges,\7\ numerous alternative trading systems,\8\ and 
broker-dealer internalizers and wholesalers, all competing for order 
flow. Based on publicly-available information, no single exchange 
currently has more than 20% market share (whether including or 
excluding auction volume).\9\

---------------------------------------------------------------------------

Proposed NYSE Arca Agg Lite Data Feed Fees
    To reflect the value of NYSE Arca's market data, the Exchange 
proposes to establish the fees listed below for the NYSE Arca Agg Lite 
data feed, operative on May 13, 2024. The Exchange proposes to charge 
fees for the same categories of market data use as its affiliated 
exchanges (namely, NYSE, NYSE American and NYSE National) currently 
charge. The Exchange believes that adopting the same fee structure as 
its affiliated exchanges would reduce administrative burdens on market 
data subscribers that also currently subscribe to market data feeds 
from the Exchange's affiliates.
    1. Access Fee. For the receipt of access to the NYSE Arca Agg Lite 
data feed, the Exchange proposes to charge $1,500 per month. This 
proposed Access Fee would be charged to any data recipient that 
receives the NYSE Arca Agg Lite data feed. Data recipients that only 
use display devices to view NYSE Arca Agg Lite market data and do not 
separately receive a data feed would not be charged an Access Fee. The 
proposed Access Fee would be charged only once per firm.
    2. User Fees. The Exchange proposes to charge a Professional User 
Fee (Per User) of $30 per month and a Non-Professional User Fee (Per 
User) of $4 per month. These user fees would apply to each display 
device that has access to the NYSE Arca Agg Lite data feed.

[[Page 47640]]

    3. Redistribution Fee. For redistribution of the NYSE Arca Agg Lite 
data feed, the Exchange proposes to establish a fee of $250 per month. 
The proposed Redistribution Fee would be charged to any Redistributor 
of the NYSE Arca Agg Lite data feed, which is defined to mean a vendor 
or any person that provides a real-time NYSE Arca market data product 
externally to a data recipient that is not its affiliate or wholly-
owned subsidiary, or to any system that an external data recipient 
uses, irrespective of the means of transmission or access. The proposed 
Redistribution Fee would be charged only once per Redistributor 
account. As an incentive to potential Redistributors to subscribe to 
the NYSE Arca Agg Lite data feed, the Exchange proposes to waive the 
Access Fee and Redistribution Fee for a Redistributor if the 
Redistributor provides NYSE Arca Agg Lite externally to at least one 
data feed recipient and reports such data feed recipient or recipients 
to the Exchange. For example, a Redistributor that subscribes to the 
NYSE Arca Agg Lite data feed will have the Access Fee and 
Redistribution Fee waived if such Redistributor provides NYSE Arca Agg 
Lite externally to at least one data feed recipient and reports such 
data feed recipient to the Exchange.
    By targeting this proposed fee waiver to Redistributors that 
provide external distribution of NYSE Arca Agg Lite, the Exchange 
believes that this would provide an incentive for Redistributors to 
make the NYSE Arca Agg Lite market data product available to its 
customers. Specifically, if a data recipient is interested in 
subscribing to NYSE Arca Agg Lite and relies on a Redistributor to 
obtain market data products from the Exchange, that data recipient 
would need its Redistributor to subscribe to and redistribute NYSE Arca 
Agg Lite. The Exchange believes that this proposed fee waiver for 
Redistributors of NYSE Arca Agg Lite would provide an incentive for 
Redistributors to make NYSE Arca Agg Lite available to their customers, 
which will increase the availability of the Exchange's market data 
products to a larger potential population of data recipients.
    Further, the Exchange proposes to adopt a credit that would be 
applicable to Redistributors that provide external distribution of NYSE 
Arca Agg Lite to Professional and Non-Professional Users. As proposed, 
such Redistributors would receive a credit equal to the amount of the 
monthly Professional User and Non-Professional User Fees for such 
external distribution, up to a maximum of the combination of the Access 
Fee and Redistribution Fee for NYSE Arca Agg Lite that the 
Redistributor would otherwise be required to pay to the Exchange. For 
example, a Redistributor that reports external Professional Users and 
Non-Professional Users in a month totaling $1,750 or more would receive 
a maximum credit of $1,750 for that month, which could effectively 
reduce its monthly fee for access and redistribution to zero. If that 
same Redistributor were to report external User quantities in a month 
totaling $600 of monthly usage, that Redistributor would receive a 
credit of $600. The Exchange believes the proposed credit would provide 
Redistributors with an incentive to increase their redistribution of 
NYSE Arca Agg Lite because the credit they would be eligible to receive 
would increase if they report additional external User quantities.
4. Enterprise Fees
    The Exchange proposes to establish an enterprise license that will 
reduce Exchange fees and administrative costs for subscribers that 
disseminate NYSE Arca Agg Lite. Subscribers that are broker-dealers 
will be able to distribute the NYSE Arca Agg Lite data feed for display 
usage to an unlimited number of non-professional users for a monthly 
fee of $35,000, with an opportunity to lower that fee to $31,500 per 
month if they contract for twelve months of service in advance. 
Alternatively, subscribers that are broker-dealers will be able to 
distribute the NYSE Arca Agg Lite data feed for display usage to an 
unlimited number of recipients (professional users and non-professional 
users) for a monthly fee of $110,000, with an opportunity to lower that 
fee to $99,000 per month if they contract for twelve months of service 
in advance.
    As proposed, the NYSE Arca Agg Lite data feed may be distributed 
pursuant to the proposed market data enterprise license only for 
display usage and in the context of a brokerage relationship with a 
broker-dealer through such broker-dealer's own devices. Purchase of an 
enterprise license would eliminate per User subscriber fees for NYSE 
Arca Agg Lite. Further, the Exchange proposes to waive the Access Fee 
and the Redistribution Fee for NYSE Arca Agg lite for Redistributors 
that pay either the Non-Professional Enterprise Fee or the Professional 
and Non-Professional Enterprise Fee. The Exchange believes the proposed 
fee waiver would provide an incentive for Redistributors to subscribe 
to the NYSE Arca Agg Lite market data product at the enterprise level 
to reduce the fees it would pay to the Exchange and without having to 
report the number of users that receive the data feed from the 
Redistributor.
    Subscribers that intend to purchase a market data enterprise 
license for at least twelve months may elect to purchase this product 
in advance for a monthly fee of $31,500 for distribution of NYSE Arca 
Agg Lite to an unlimited number of non-professional users, or $99,000 
per month for distribution to an unlimited number of professional users 
and non-professional users. This feature is intended to simplify cost 
projections and budgeting for both subscribers and the Exchange. 
Subscribers that elect not to purchase this particular feature will 
nevertheless be able to obtain all of the market data information 
offered by NYSE Arca Agg Lite by paying the standard fee of $35,000 per 
month for distribution of NYSE Arca Agg Lite to an unlimited number of 
non-professional users, or $110,000 per month for distribution to an 
unlimited number of professional users and non-professional users. 
Subscribers that elect to pay the monthly fee will be able to switch to 
the annual fee at any time, and those that elect to purchase the annual 
contract would be able to change to the monthly contract, with notice, 
at the end of the twelve-month period.
    The Exchange believes that the proposed market data enterprise 
license will reduce exchange fees, lower administrative costs for 
subscribers, and help expand the availability of market information to 
investors, and thereby increase participation in financial markets.
5. Non-Display Use Fees
    The Exchange proposes to establish non-display fees for the NYSE 
Arca Agg Lite data feed that are based on the non-display use 
categories charged by NYSE, NYSE American, NYSE National, the CTA, and 
the UTP Plan for non-display use.\10\ Non-display use would mean

[[Page 47641]]

accessing, processing, or consuming the NYSE Arca Agg Lite data feed 
delivered directly or through a Redistributor, for a purpose other than 
in support of a data recipient's display or further internal or 
external redistribution (``Non-Display Use''). Non-Display Use would 
include trading uses such as high frequency or algorithmic trading as 
well as any trading in any asset class, automated order or quote 
generation and/or order pegging, price referencing for algorithmic 
trading or smart order routing, operations control programs, investment 
analysis, order verification, surveillance programs, risk management, 
compliance, and portfolio management.

Exchange Act Release Nos. 69315 (April 5, 2013), 78 FR 21668 (April 
11, 2013) (SR-NYSEArca-2013-37) and 73011 (September 5, 2014), 79 FR 
54315 (September 11, 2014) (SR-NYSEARCA-2014-93).
---------------------------------------------------------------------------

    Under the proposal, for Non-Display Use of NYSE Arca Agg Lite, 
there would be three categories of, and fees applicable, to, data 
recipients. One, two, or three categories of Non-Display Use may apply 
to a data recipient.
    <bullet> As proposed, the Category 1 Fee would be $4,500 per month 
and would apply when a data recipient's Non-Display Use of the NYSE 
Arca Agg Lite data feed is on its own behalf, not on behalf of its 
clients.
    <bullet> As proposed, Category 2 Fees would be $4,500 per month and 
would apply to a data recipient's Non-Display Use of the NYSE Arca Agg 
Lite data feed on behalf of its clients.
    <bullet> As proposed, Category 3 Fees would be $4,500 per month and 
would apply to a data recipient's Non-Display Use of the NYSE Arca Agg 
Lite data feed for the purpose of internally matching buy and sell 
orders within an organization, including matching customer orders for a 
data recipient's own behalf and/or on behalf of its clients. This 
category would apply to Non-Display Use in trading platforms, such as, 
but not restricted to, alternative trading systems (``ATSs''), broker 
crossing networks, broker crossing systems not filed as ATSs, dark 
pools, multilateral trading facilities, exchanges and systematic 
internalization systems. A data recipient will be charged $4,500 per 
month for each platform on which it uses the Non-Display data 
internally to match buy and sell orders, up to a cap of $13,500 per 
month; even if the data recipient uses the NYSE Arca Agg Lite data feed 
for more than three platforms, it will not pay more than $13,500 for 
such Category 3 use per month.
    The description of the three non-display use categories is set 
forth in the Fee Schedule in endnote 1 and that endnote would be 
referenced in the NYSE Arca Agg Lite data feed fees on the Fee 
Schedule. The text in the endnote would remain unchanged.
    Data recipients that receive the NYSE Arca Agg Lite data feed for 
Non-Display Use would be required to complete and submit a Non-Display 
Use Declaration before they would be authorized to receive the feed. A 
firm subject to Category 3 Fees would be required to identify each 
platform that uses the NYSE Arca Agg Lite data feed for a Category 3 
Non-Display Use basis, such as ATSs and broker crossing systems not 
registered as ATSs, as part of the Non-Display Use Declaration.
    6. Non-Display Use Declaration Late Fee. Data recipients that 
receive the NYSE Arca Agg Lite data feed for Non-Display Use would be 
required to complete and submit a Non-Display Use Declaration before 
they would be authorized to receive the feed. Beginning in 2025, NYSE 
Arca Agg Lite data feed recipients would be required to submit, by 
January 31 of each year, the Non-Display Use Declaration. The 
requirement to submit a Non-Display Use Declaration applies to all 
real-time NYSE Arca data feed product recipients. The Exchange proposes 
to charge a Non-Display Use Declaration Late Fee of $1,000 per month to 
any data recipient that pays an Access Fee for the NYSE Arca Agg Lite 
data feed that has failed to timely complete and submit a Non-Display 
Use Declaration. Specifically, with respect to the Non-Display Use 
Declaration due by January 31 of each year, the Non-Display Use 
Declaration Late Fee would apply to data recipients that fail to 
complete and submit the Non-Display Use Declaration by the January 31 
due date, and would apply beginning February 1 and for each month 
thereafter until the data recipient has completed and submitted the 
annual Non-Display Use Declaration.
    The proposed Non-Display Use Declaration Late Fee applicable to 
NYSE Arca Agg Lite data feed would be set forth in endnote 2 on the Fee 
Schedule. As proposed, endnote 2 would be amended with the proposed 
addition of the following new text: ``The Non-Display Declaration Late 
Fee will apply, beginning in 2025, to NYSE Arca Aggregated Lite data 
recipients that fail to complete and submit the annual Non-Display Use 
Declaration by the January 31st due date, and applies beginning 
February 1st and for each month thereafter until the data recipient has 
completed and submitted the annual Non-Display Use Declaration.''
    In addition, if a data recipient's use of the NYSE Arca Agg Lite 
data feed changes at any time after the data recipient submits a Non-
Display Use Declaration, the data recipient must inform the Exchange of 
the change by completing and submitting at the time of the change an 
updated declaration reflecting the change of use.
    7. Multiple Data Feed Fee. The Exchange proposes to establish a 
monthly fee, the ``Multiple Data Feed Fee,'' that would apply to data 
recipients that take a data feed for a market data product in more than 
two locations. Data recipients taking the NYSE Arca Agg Lite data feed 
in more than two locations would be charged $200 per additional 
location per month. No new reporting would be required.\11\
---------------------------------------------------------------------------

    \11\ Data vendors currently report a unique Vendor Account 
Number for each location at which they provide a data feed to a data 
recipient. The Exchange considers each Vendor Account Number a 
location. For example, if a data recipient has five Vendor Account 
Numbers, representing five locations, for the receipt of the NYSE 
Arca Agg Lite data feed, that data recipient will pay the Multiple 
Data Feed fee with respect to three of the five locations.
---------------------------------------------------------------------------

    8. Three-Month Fee Waiver. The Exchange currently provides a one-
month free trial to any firm that subscribes to a particular NYSE Arca 
market data product for the first time. Under the current one-month 
trial, a first-time subscriber is not charged the Access Fee, Non-
Display Fee, any applicable Professional and Non-Professional User Fee 
and Redistribution Fee for one calendar month.\12\ The Exchange now 
proposes an additional three-month fee waiver for any Redistributor 
that subscribes to a particular NYSE Arca market data product for the 
first time for external redistribution. As proposed, a first-time 
Redistributor would be any firm that has not previously subscribed to 
and externally redistributed a particular NYSE Arca market data product 
listed on the Fee Schedule. As proposed, a first-time Redistributor 
that subscribes to a particular NYSE Arca market data product would not 
be charged the Access Fee and the Redistribution Fee for that product 
for three calendar months. Any other fees, including but not limited 
to, Non-Display Fee, any applicable Professional and Non-Professional 
User Fee, and Enterprise Fee would be billable after the first calendar 
month after a first-time Redistributor subscribes to a particular NYSE 
Arca market data product. For example, a first-time Redistributor that 
chooses to subscribe to NYSE Arca Agg Lite on June 24, 2024 would not 
be charged the Access Fee and the Redistribution Fee for the months of 
July, August, and September 2024. The proposed fee waiver would be for 
the three calendar months following the date a Redistributor is 
approved to

[[Page 47642]]

receive access to the particular NYSE Arca market data product. The 
Exchange would provide the three-month fee waiver for each particular 
product to each Redistributor once.
---------------------------------------------------------------------------

    \12\ See Fee Schedule.
---------------------------------------------------------------------------

    The Exchange believes that providing a three-month fee waiver to 
NYSE Arca market data products listed on the Fee Schedule would enable 
potential Redistributors to determine whether a particular NYSE Arca 
market data product provides value to their business models before 
fully committing to expend development and implementation costs related 
to the receipt of that product, and is intended to encourage increased 
use of the Exchange's market data products by defraying some of the 
development and implementation costs Redistributors would ordinarily 
have to expend before using a product. The proposed three-month fee 
waiver would also provide Redistributors with time to begin onboarding 
new clients prior to being liable to the Access Fee and the 
Redistribution Fee, allowing time to choose how to allocate costs and 
increase revenues to defray costs associated with providing a new feed 
to its customers.
Application of Proposed Fees
    The Exchange is not required to make the NYSE Arca Agg Lite data 
feed available or to offer any specific pricing alternatives to any 
customers, nor is any firm required to purchase the NYSE Arca Agg Lite 
data feed. Firms that choose to purchase the NYSE Arca Agg Lite data 
feed do so for the primary goals of using it to increase their 
revenues, reduce their expenses, and in some instances to compete 
directly with the Exchange (including for order flow). Those firms are 
able to determine for themselves whether or not the NYSE Arca Agg Lite 
data feed or any other similar products are attractively priced.
    The Exchange believes that subscribers would use the price level 
detail information available in the NYSE Arca Agg Lite data feed to 
make trading decisions that directly benefit the transaction services 
that the Exchange offers. The Exchange determined the level of the fees 
to charge for the NYSE Arca Agg Lite data feed based on the value of 
the Exchange's transaction services.
    The Exchange believes the proposed rule change would provide an 
incentive both for data subscribers to subscribe to NYSE Arca Agg Lite 
and for Redistributors to subscribe to the product for purposes of 
providing external distribution of NYSE Arca Agg Lite. The Exchange 
believes that this proposed rule change also has the potential to 
attract new Redistributors for NYSE Arca Agg Lite.
    The proposed fee structure is not novel as it is based on the fee 
structure currently in place for the NYSE ArcaBook feed. The Exchange 
is proposing fees for the NYSE Arca Agg Lite data feed that are based 
on the existing fee structure and rates that data recipients already 
pay for the NYSE ArcaBook feed. Specifically, the fees for the NYSE 
ArcaBook feed--which like the NYSE Arca Agg Lite data feed, includes 
depth of book, auction imbalances, and security status messages--
consist of an Access Fee of $2,000 per month, a Professional User Fee 
(Per User) of $60 per month, a Non-Professional User Fee (Per User) 
that ranges between $3 per month to $10 per month, Non-Display Fees of 
$6,000 per month for each of Categories 1, 2 and 3, and a 
Redistribution Fee of $2,000 per month. The Exchange also charges a 
Non-Display Use Declaration Late Fee of $1,000 per month and a Multiple 
Data Feed Fee of $200 per month for NYSE ArcaBook.\13\

---------------------------------------------------------------------------

2. Statutory Basis
    The Exchange believes that the proposed rule change is consistent 
with the provisions of Section 6 of the Act,\14\ in general, and 
Sections 6(b)(4) and 6(b)(5) of the Act,\15\ in particular, in that it 
provides an equitable allocation of reasonable fees among users and 
recipients of the data and is not designed to permit unfair 
discrimination among customers, issuers, and brokers.

---------------------------------------------------------------------------

The Proposed Rule Change Is Reasonable
    In adopting Regulation NMS, the Commission granted SROs and broker-
dealers increased authority and flexibility to offer new and unique 
market data to the public. The Commission has repeatedly expressed its 
preference for competition over regulatory intervention in determining 
prices, products, and services in the securities markets. Specifically, 
in Regulation NMS, the Commission highlighted the importance of market 
forces in determining prices and SRO revenues, and also recognized that 
current regulation of the market system ``has been remarkably 
successful in promoting market competition in its broader forms that 
are most important to investors and listed companies.'' \16\
---------------------------------------------------------------------------

    \16\ See Regulation NMS Adopting Release, 70 FR 37495, at 37499.
---------------------------------------------------------------------------

    With respect to market data, the decision of the United States 
Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia Circuit in NetCoalition 
v. SEC upheld the Commission's reliance on the existence of competitive 
market mechanisms to evaluate the reasonableness and fairness of fees 
for proprietary market data:

    In fact, the legislative history indicates that the Congress 
intended that the market system ``evolve through the interplay of 
competitive forces as unnecessary regulatory restrictions are 
removed'' and that the SEC wield its regulatory power ``in those 
situations where competition may not be sufficient,'' such as in the 
creation of a ``consolidated transactional reporting system.'' \17\

(``NetCoalition I'') (quoting H.R. Rep. No. 94-229 at 92 (1975), as 
reprinted in 1975 U.S.C.C.A.N. 323).

    The court agreed with the Commission's conclusion that ``Congress 
intended that `competitive forces should dictate the services and 
practices that constitute the U.S. national market system for trading 
equity securities.' '' \18\

    More recently, the Commission confirmed that it applies a ``market-
based'' test in its assessment of market data fees, and that under that 
test:

the Commission considers whether the exchange was subject to 
significant competitive forces in setting the terms of its proposal 
for [market data], including the level of any fees. If an exchange 
meets this burden, the Commission will find that its fee rule is 
consistent with the Act unless there is a substantial countervailing 
basis to find that the terms of the rule violate the Act or the 
rules thereunder.\19\

16, 2020), 85 FR 67392 (October 22, 2020) (SR-NYSENAT-2020-05) 
(``National IF Approval Order'') (internal quotation marks omitted),

2008), 73 FR 74770, 74781 (December 9, 2008).

    An exchange may demonstrate that its fees are constrained by 
competitive forces by showing that platform competition applies.
    As the United States Supreme Court recognized in Ohio v. American 
Express, platforms are firms that act as intermediaries between two or 
more sets of agents, and typically the choices made on one side of the 
platform affect the results on the other side of the platform via 
externalities, or ``indirect network effects.'' \20\ Externalities are 
linkages between the different sides of

[[Page 47643]]

a platform such that one cannot understand pricing and competition for 
goods or services on one side of the platform in isolation; one must 
also account for the influence of the other sides. As the Supreme Court 
explained:
---------------------------------------------------------------------------

    \20\ Ohio v. American Express, 138 S. Ct. 2274, 2280-81 (2018).

    To ensure sufficient participation, two-sided platforms must be 
sensitive to the prices that they charge each side. . . . Raising 
the price on side A risks losing participation on that side, which 
decreases the value of the platform to side B. If the participants 
on side B leave due to this loss in value, then the platform has 
even less value to side A--risking a feedback loop of declining 
demand. . . . Two-sided platforms therefore must take these indirect 
network effects into account before making a change in price on 
either side.\21\
---------------------------------------------------------------------------

    \21\ Id. at 2281.

    The Exchange and its affiliated exchanges have long maintained that 
they function as platforms between consumers of market data and 
consumers of trading services. Proving the existence of linkages 
between the two sides of this platform requires an in-depth economic 
analysis of both public data and confidential exchange data about 
particular customers' trading activities and market data purchases. 
Exchanges, however, are prohibited from publicly sharing details about 
these specific customer activities and purchases. For example, pursuant 
to Exchange Rule 7.41-E, transactions executed on the Exchange are 
processed anonymously.
    Exchanges function as platforms for market data and transaction 
services mean that exchanges do not set fees for market data products 
without considering, and being constrained by, the effect the fees will 
have on the order-flow side of the platform. As the D.C. Circuit 
recognized in NetCoalition I, ``[n]o one disputes that competition for 
order flow is fierce.'' \22\ The court further noted that ``no exchange 
possesses a monopoly, regulatory or otherwise, in the execution of 
order flow from broker dealers,'' and that an exchange ``must compete 
vigorously for order flow to maintain its share of trading volume.'' 
\23\
---------------------------------------------------------------------------

---------------------------------------------------------------------------

    As noted above, while Regulation NMS has enhanced competition, it 
has also fostered a ``fragmented'' market structure where trading in a 
single stock can occur across multiple trading centers. When multiple 
trading centers compete for order flow in the same stock, the 
Commission has recognized that ``such competition can lead to the 
fragmentation of order flow in that stock.'' \24\ The Commission's 
Division of Trading and Markets has also recognized that with so many 
``operating equities exchanges and dozens of ATSs, there is vigorous 
price competition among the U.S. equity markets and, as a result, 
[transaction] fees are tailored and frequently modified to attract 
particular types of order flow, some of which is highly fluid and price 
sensitive.'' \25\ Indeed, today, equity trading is currently dispersed 
across 16 exchanges,\26\ numerous alternative trading systems,\27\ 
broker-dealer internalizers and wholesalers, all competing for order 
flow. Based on publicly-available information, no single exchange 
currently has more than 20% market share.\28\

    Further, low barriers to entry mean that new exchanges may rapidly 
and inexpensively enter the market and offer additional substitute 
platforms to compete with the Exchange. For example, since 2020, three 
new ones have entered the market: Long Term Stock Exchange (LTSE), 
which began operations as an exchange on August 28, 2020; \29\ Members 
Exchange (MEMX), which began operations as an exchange on September 29,

---------------------------------------------------------------------------

    These low barriers enable existing exchange customers to 
disintermediate and start their own exchanges if they think the prices 
charged for exchange proprietary market data products are too high. 
This is precisely the rationale behind the creation of MEMX, which was 
formed by some of the largest and most well capitalized financial firms 
that are also Exchange customers (including Bank of America, BlackRock, 
Charles Schwab, Citadel, Citi, E*Trade, Fidelity, Goldman Sachs, J.P. 
Morgan, Jane Street, Morgan Stanley, TD Ameritrade, and others).\32\

aims to drive simplicity, efficiency, and competition in equity 
markets.''), available at <a href="https://memx.com/">https://memx.com/</a>.
---------------------------------------------------------------------------

    For example, one of MEMX's founding principles is that exchange 
proprietary market data prices are too high, and that MEMX will benefit 
its members by offering ``[l]ower pricing on market data.'' \33\ Nor is 
this a new phenomenon: exchange customers formed BATS to compete with 
incumbent exchanges and once registered as an exchange in 2008, BATS 
did not initially charge for market data. The BATS venture was a 
financial success for its founders, first through recouping their 
investment in its initial public offering and then in the subsequent 
sale of BATS to Cboe, which now charges for market data from those 
exchanges. Notably, MEMX has some of the same founding broker-dealer 
customers, leading some to dub MEMX ``BATS 2.0.'' \34\

    The fact that this cycle is viable and repeatable by entities that 
both trade on and compete with existing exchanges confirms that 
barriers to entry are low and that these markets are competitive and 
contestable.\35\ And low barriers to

[[Page 47644]]

entry act as a market check on high prices.\36\

services of an external product with an internally-created system,

relevant product) should be included in the same market.''). In 
SunGard, the court rejected the Antitrust Division's attempt to 
block SunGuard's acquisition of the disaster recovery assets of 
Comdisco on the basis that the acquisition would ``substantially 
lessen competition in the market for shared hotsite disaster 
recovery services,'' when the evidence showed that ``internal 
hotsites'' created by customers competed with the ``external shared 
hotsite business'' engaged in by the merging parties. Id. at 173-74,

with Two-Sided Platforms, in 1 Issues In Competition Law And Policy 
667, 685 (ABA Section of Antitrust Law 2008) (noting that exchange 
mergers in 2005 and 2006 were approved by competition authorities in 
part in reliance on planned and likely entry of other firms).
---------------------------------------------------------------------------

    In sum, the fierce competition for order flow thus constrains any 
exchange from pricing its market data at a supracompetitive price and 
constrains the Exchange in setting its fees at issue here.
    The proposed fees are therefore reasonable because in setting them, 
the Exchange is constrained by the availability of numerous substitute 
platforms offering market data products and trading. Such substitutes 
need not be identical, but only substantially similar to the product at 
hand.
    More specifically, in setting fees for the NYSE Arca Agg Lite data 
feed, the Exchange is constrained by the fact that, if its pricing 
across the platform is unattractive to customers, customers have their 
pick of an increasing number of alternative platforms to use instead of 
the Exchange. The Exchange believes that it has considered all relevant 
factors and has not considered irrelevant factors in order to establish 
reasonable fees. The existence of numerous alternative platforms to the 
Exchange's platform ensures that the Exchange cannot set unreasonable 
market data fees without suffering the negative effects of that 
decision in the fiercely competitive market for trading order flow.
    Subscribing to the NYSE Arca Agg Lite is entirely optional. The 
Exchange is not required to make the NYSE Arca Agg Lite available to 
any customers, nor is any customer required to purchase the NYSE Arca 
Agg Lite market data feed. Unlike some other data products (e.g., the 
consolidated quotation and last-sale information feeds) that firms are 
required to purchase in order to fulfil regulatory obligations,\37\ a 
customer's decision whether to purchase the NYSE Arca Agg Lite is 
entirely discretionary. Most firms that choose to subscribe to the NYSE 
Arca Agg Lite would do so for the primary goals of using it to increase 
their revenues, reduce their expenses, and in some instances to compete 
directly with the Exchange for order flow. Such firms are able to 
determine for themselves whether the NYSE Arca Agg Lite data feed is 
necessary for their business needs, and if so, whether or not it is 
attractively priced. If the NYSE Arca Agg Lite data feed does not 
provide sufficient value to firms based on the uses those firms may 
have for it, such firms may simply choose to conduct their business 
operations in ways that do not use the NYSE Arca Agg Lite data feed.
---------------------------------------------------------------------------

    \37\ The Exchange notes that broker-dealers are not required to 
purchase proprietary market data to comply with their best execution 
obligations. See In the Matter of the Application of Securities 
Industry and Financial Markets Association for Review of Actions 
Taken by Self-Regulatory Organizations, Release Nos. 34-72182; AP-3-
15350; AP-3-15351 (May 16, 2014). Similarly, there is no requirement 
in Regulation NMS or any other rule that proprietary data be 
utilized for order routing decisions, and some broker-dealers and 
ATSs have chosen not to do so.
---------------------------------------------------------------------------

    Further, in the case of products that are also redistributed 
through market data vendors such as Bloomberg and Refinitiv, the 
vendors themselves provide additional price discipline for proprietary 
data products because they control the primary means of access to 
certain end users. These vendors impose price discipline based upon 
their business models. For example, vendors that assess a surcharge on 
data they sell are able to refuse to offer proprietary products that 
their end users do not or will not purchase in sufficient numbers. 
Vendors may elect not to make NYSE Arca Agg Lite available to its 
customers unless their customers request it, and customers will not 
elect to pay the proposed fees unless NYSE Arca Agg Lite can provide 
value by sufficiently increasing revenues or reducing costs in the 
customer's business in a manner that will offset the fees. All of these 
factors operate as constraints on pricing proprietary data products.
    In setting the proposed fees for the NYSE Arca Agg Lite data feed, 
the Exchange considered the competitiveness of the market for 
proprietary data and all of the implications of that competition.
    Even putting aside the facts that exchanges are platforms and that 
pricing decisions on the two sides of the platform are intertwined, the 
Exchange is constrained in setting the proposed market data fees by the 
availability of numerous substitute market data products. The 
Commission has been clear that substitute products need not be 
identical, but only substantially similar to the product at hand.\38\
---------------------------------------------------------------------------

    \38\ For example, in the National IF Approval Order, the 
Commission recognized that for some customers, the best bid and 
offer information from consolidated data feeds may function as a 
substitute for the NYSE National Integrated Feed product, which 
contains order by order information. See National IF Approval Order, 
supra note 19, at 67397 [release p. 21] (``[I]nformation provided by 
NYSE National demonstrates that a number of executing broker-dealers 
do not subscribe to the NYSE National Integrated Feed and executing 
broker-dealers can otherwise obtain NYSE National best bid and offer 
information from the consolidated data feeds.'' (internal quotations 
omitted)).
---------------------------------------------------------------------------

    The NYSE Arca Aggregated Lite market data feed is subject to 
significant competitive forces that constrain its pricing. 
Specifically, the NYSE Arca Agg Lite data feed competes head-to-head 
with similar market data products currently offered by the four U.S. 
equities exchanges operated by Cboe Exchange, Inc.--Cboe BZX Exchange, 
Inc. (``BZX''), Cboe BYX Exchange, Inc. (``BYX''), Cboe EDGA Exchange, 
Inc. (``EDGA''), and Cboe EDGX Exchange, Inc. (``EDGX''), each of which 
offers a market data product called BZX Summary Depth, BYX Summary 
Depth, EDGA Summary Depth and EDGX Summary Depth, respectively 
(collectively, the ``Cboe Summary Depth'').\39\ Similar to Cboe Summary 
Depth, NYSE Arca Agg Lite can be utilized by vendors and subscribers to 
quickly access and distribute aggregated order book data. As noted 
above, NYSE Arca Agg Lite, similar to Cboe Summary Depth, would provide 
aggregated depth per security, including the bid, ask and share 
quantity for orders received by NYSE Arca, except unlike Cboe Summary 
Depth, which provides aggregated depth per security for up to five 
price levels, NYSE Arca Agg Lite would provide aggregated depth per 
security for up to ten price levels on both the bid and offer sides of 
the NYSE Arca limit order book as well as auction imbalance data.
---------------------------------------------------------------------------

    \39\ See BZX Rule 11.22(m) BZX Summary Depth; BYX Rule 11.22(k) 
BYX Summary Depth; EDGA Rule 13.8(f) EDGA Summary Depth; and EDGX 
Rule 13.8(f) EDGX Summary Depth. The Cboe Summary Depth offered by 
BZX, BYX, EDGA and EDGX are each a data feed that offers aggregated 
two-sided quotations for all displayed orders for up to five (5) 
price levels and contains the individual last sale information, 
market status, trading status and trade break messages.
---------------------------------------------------------------------------

    The specific fees that the Exchange proposes for the NYSE Arca Agg 
Lite data feed are reasonable for the following additional reasons.
    Overall. The Exchange believes that the proposed fees for the NYSE 
Arca Agg Lite data feed are reasonable because they represent the value 
of the data available but also the value of receiving the data on an 
aggregated basis. The Exchange believes that providing vendors and 
subscribers with the option to subscribe to a market data product that 
integrates a subset of data from existing products and where such 
aggregated data is published at a pre-defined interval, thus lowering 
bandwidth, infrastructure and

[[Page 47645]]

operational requirements, would allow vendors and subscribers to choose 
the best solution for their specific business needs.
    The Exchange believes the proposed fees for the NYSE Arca Agg Lite 
data feed are also reasonable when compared to fees for comparable 
products, such as the Cboe Summary Depth.\40\ Additionally, the 
Exchange is proposing fees for the NYSE Arca Agg Lite data feed that 
are based on the existing fee structure that data recipients already 
pay for the NYSE Arca's other market data products. The Exchange 
believes that adopting the same fee structure would reduce 
administrative burdens on NYSE Arca data subscribers that also 
currently subscribe to market data feeds from NYSE Arca.

---------------------------------------------------------------------------

    Access Fee. The Exchange believes that is reasonable to charge 
access fees because of the value of the data to data recipients in 
their profit-generating activities. The Exchange believes that the 
proposed monthly Access Fee of $1,500 for the NYSE Arca Aggregated Lite 
data feed is reasonable because it is lower than the fees charged by 
BZX, BYX, EDGA, and EDGX, each of which charges between $2,500 per 
month to $5,000 per month for both Internal Distribution and External 
Distribution of the Cboe Summary Depth market data product.\41\
---------------------------------------------------------------------------

    \41\ Id.
---------------------------------------------------------------------------

    User Fees. The Exchange believes that having separate Professional 
and Non-Professional User fees for the NYSE Arca Agg Lite data feed is 
reasonable because it will make the product more affordable and result 
in greater availability to Professional and Non-Professional Users. 
Setting a modest Non-Professional User fee is reasonable because it 
provides an additional method for Non-Professional Users to access the 
NYSE Arca Agg Lite data feed by providing the same data that is 
available to Professional Users. The proposed monthly Professional User 
Fee (Per User) of $30 and monthly Non-Professional User Fee (Per User) 
of $4 are reasonable because they are comparable to user fees generally 
charged by exchanges. For example, NYSE Arca charges a monthly 
Professional User Fee (Per User) of $60 and a monthly Non-Professional 
User Fee (Per User) of up to $10 for the NYSE ArcaBook feed.\42\ 
Although the proposed User Fees for Professional and Non-Professional 
Users are higher than those charged by BZX, BYX, EDGA and EDGX, the 
Exchange notes that User fees are only a subset of the total fees that 
vendors and subscribers pay and the lower fees proposed to access and 
redistribute NYSE Arca Agg Lite would provide such market data 
recipients with a more affordable alternative to existing substitutes 
offered by the Exchange and its competitors.
---------------------------------------------------------------------------

    \42\ See Fee Schedule.
---------------------------------------------------------------------------

    Redistribution Fees. The Exchange believes that it is reasonable to 
charge redistribution fees because vendors receive value from 
redistributing the data in their business products for their customers. 
The Exchange believes that charging a Redistribution Fee is reasonable 
because the vendors that would be charged such a fee profit by re-
transmitting the Exchange's market data to their customers. This fee 
would be charged only once per month to each vendor account that 
redistributes the NYSE Arca Agg Lite data feed, regardless of the 
number of customers to which that vendor redistributes the data. The 
Exchange believes the proposed monthly Redistribution Fee of $250 for 
the NYSE Arca Agg Lite data feed is reasonable because it is nominal 
and lower than the fees charged by BZX, BYX, EDGA and EDGX, each of 
which charges considerably more for both Internal Distribution and 
External Distribution of the Cboe Summary Depth market data feed.\43\
---------------------------------------------------------------------------

    \43\ See supra, note 40.
---------------------------------------------------------------------------

    Enterprise Fees. The Exchange believes the proposed enterprise 
license is reasonable because it would reduce exchange fees, lower 
administrative costs for subscribers that are broker-dealers and help 
expand the availability of market information to investors, and thereby 
increase participation in financial markets. Subscribers that are 
broker-dealers would be able to disseminate the NYSE Arca Agg Lite data 
feed for display usage to an unlimited number of non-professional users 
for a monthly fee of $35,000, or $31,500 if they contract for twelve 
months of service in advance. Alternatively, subscribers that are 
broker-dealers would be able to disseminate the NYSE Arca Agg Lite data 
feed for display usage to an unlimited number of professional users and 
non-professional users for a monthly fee of $110,000, or $99,000 if 
they contract for twelve months of service in advance. The proposed 
enterprise license would result in lower fees for subscribers able to 
reach the largest audience of investors, including retail investors. 
Discounts for broader dissemination of market data information have 
routinely been adopted by exchanges and permitted by the Commission as 
equitable allocations of reasonable dues, fees and charges.\44\
---------------------------------------------------------------------------

    \44\ For example, the Commission has permitted pricing discounts 
for market data under Nasdaq Rules 7023(c) and 7047(b). See also 
Securities Exchange Act Release No. 82182 (November 30, 2017), 82 FR 
57627 (December 6, 2017) (SR-NYSE-2017-60) (changing an enterprise 
fee for NYSE BBO and NYSE Trades).
---------------------------------------------------------------------------

    Non-Display Use Fees. The Exchange believes the proposed Non-
Display Use fees are reasonable, because they reflect the value of the 
data to the data recipients in their profit-generating activities and 
do not impose the burden of counting non-display devices.
    The Exchange believes that the proposed Non-Display Use fees 
reflect the significant value of the non-display data use to data 
recipients, which purchase such data on an entirely voluntary basis. 
Non-display data can be used by data recipients for a wide variety of 
profit-generating purposes, including proprietary and agency trading 
and smart order routing, as well as by data recipients that operate 
order matching and execution platforms that compete directly with the 
Exchange for order flow. The data also can be used for a variety of 
non-trading purposes that indirectly support trading, such as risk 
management and compliance. Although some of these non-trading uses do 
not directly generate revenues, they can nonetheless substantially 
reduce a recipient's costs by automating such functions so that they 
can be carried out in a more efficient and accurate manner and reduce 
errors and labor costs, thereby benefiting recipients. The Exchange 
believes that charging for non-trading uses is reasonable because data 
recipients can derive substantial value from such uses, for example, by 
automating tasks so that can be performed more quickly and accurately 
and less expensively than if they were performed manually.
    Previously, the non-display use data pricing policies of many 
exchanges required customers to count, and the exchanges to audit the 
count of, the number of non-display devices used by a customer. As non-
display use grew more prevalent and varied, however, exchanges received 
an increasing number of complaints about the impracticality and 
administrative burden associated with that approach. In response, the 
Exchange and its affiliated exchanges developed a non-display use 
pricing structure that does not require non-display devices to be 
counted or those counts to be audited, and instead looks merely at the 
three following categories of potential use of non-display data: use of 
the data on the customer's own behalf (Category 1), use

[[Page 47646]]

on behalf of clients (Category 2), and use to internally match buy and 
sell orders within an organization (Category 3).
    The Exchange believes that it is reasonable to segment the fee for 
non-display use into these three categories. As noted above, the uses 
to which customers can put the NYSE Arca Agg Lite data feed are 
numerous and varied, and the Exchange believes that charging separate 
fees for these separate categories of use is reasonable because it 
reflects the actual value the customer derives from the data, based 
upon how many categories of use the customer makes of the data. 
Segmenting the fees for non-display data in this way avoids the 
unreasonable result of customers that make only limited non-display use 
of the data paying the same fees as customers that use the data for 
numerous different revenue-generating and cost-saving purposes.
    The Exchange believes that the proposed fees of $4,500 per month 
for each of Categories 1, 2, and 3 is reasonable. These fees are 
comparable to non-display use fees generally charged by exchanges. For 
example, the fees for Non-Display Use of NYSE ArcaBook for Categories 
1, 2 and 3 is $6,000 per month.\45\ The Exchange believes that the 
proposed fees directly and appropriately reflect the significant value 
of using non-display data in a wide range of computer-automated 
functions relating to both trading and non-trading activities and that 
the number and range of these functions continue to grow through 
innovation and technology developments.
---------------------------------------------------------------------------

    \45\ See Fee Schedule.
---------------------------------------------------------------------------

    The Exchange also believes that, regarding Category 3 fees, it is 
reasonable to charge $4,500 per month for each trading platform on 
which the data recipient uses the Non-Display data, because such use of 
the data is directly in competition with the Exchange and the Exchange 
should be permitted to recoup some of its lost trading revenue by 
charging for the data that makes such competition possible. The 
Exchange believes that it is reasonable to cap such fees for Category 3 
use at $13,500 per month per data recipient, because a higher monthly 
fee may potentially dissuade competitors from buying the NYSE Arca Agg 
Lite data feed for use by their trading platforms.
    The proposed Non-Display Use fees for the NYSE Arca Agg Lite data 
feed are also reasonable because they take into account the extra value 
of receiving the data for Non-Display Use on an integrated basis. The 
Exchange believes that the proposed fees directly and appropriately 
reflect the significant value of using the NYSE Arca Agg Lite data feed 
on a non-display basis in a wide range of computer-automated functions 
relating to both trading and non-trading activities and that the number 
and range of these functions continue to grow through innovation and 
technology developments.\46\
---------------------------------------------------------------------------

    \46\ See also Exchange Act Release No. 69157, March 18, 2013, 78 
FR 17946, 17949 (March 25, 2013) (SR-CTA/CQ-2013-01) (``[D]ata feeds 
have become more valuable, as recipients now use them to perform a 
far larger array of non-display functions. Some firms even base 
their business models on the incorporation of data feeds into black 
boxes and application programming interfaces that apply trading 
algorithms to the data, but that do not require widespread data 
access by the firm's employees. As a result, these firms pay little 
for data usage beyond access fees, yet their data access and usage 
is critical to their businesses.'').
---------------------------------------------------------------------------

    Non-Display Use Declaration Late Fee. The Exchange believes that it 
is reasonable to require annual submissions of the Non-Display Use 
Declaration so that the Exchange will have current and accurate 
information about the use of the NYSE Arca Agg Lite data feed and can 
correctly assess fees for the uses of the NYSE Arca Agg Lite data feed. 
Requiring annual submissions of such declarations is reasonable because 
it also allows users to re-assess their own usage each year.
    The Exchange believes that it is reasonable to impose a late fee in 
connection with the submission of the Non-Display Use Declaration. In 
order to correctly assess fees for the non-display use of the NYSE Arca 
Agg Lite data feed, the Exchange needs to have current and accurate 
information about the use of the NYSE Arca Agg Lite data feed. The 
failure of data recipients to submit the Non-Display Use Declaration on 
time leads to potentially incorrect billing and administrative burdens, 
including tracking and obtaining late Non-Display Use Declarations and 
correcting and following up on payments owed in connection with late 
Non-Display Use Declarations. The purpose of the late fee is to incent 
data recipients to submit the Non-Display Use Declaration promptly to 
avoid the administrative burdens associated with the late submission of 
Non-Display Use Declarations.
    Multiple Data Feed Fee. The Exchange believes that it is reasonable 
to require data recipients to pay a modest additional fee for taking a 
data feed for a market data product in more than two locations, because 
such data recipients can derive substantial value from being able to 
consume the product in as many locations as they want. In addition, 
there are administrative burdens associated with tracking each location 
at which a data recipient receives the product. The Multiple Data Feed 
Fee is designed to encourage data recipients to better manage their 
requests for additional data feeds and to monitor their usage of data 
feeds. The proposed fee is designed to apply to data feeds received in 
more than two locations so that each data recipient can have one 
primary and one backup data location before having to pay a multiple 
data feed fee.
    Three-Month Fee Waiver. The Exchange believes the proposal to waive 
the Access Fee and the Redistribution Fee for the NYSE Arca Agg Lite 
data feed to new Redistributors for three calendar months is reasonable 
because it would enable potential Redistributors to determine whether a 
particular NYSE Arca market data product provides value to their 
business models before fully committing to expend development and 
implementation costs related to the receipt of that product, and is 
intended to encourage increased use of the Exchange's market data 
products by defraying some of the development and implementation costs 
Redistributors would ordinarily have to expend before using a product. 
The proposed fee waiver would also allow Redistributors to become 
familiar with the feed and determine whether it suits their needs 
without incurring fees. Making a new market data product available 
without charging a fee for three months is consistent with offerings of 
other exchanges. For example, BZX offers subscribers of BZX Summary 
Depth a three-month credit for external distribution, which is akin to 
the three-month fee waiver proposed by the Exchange.\47\
---------------------------------------------------------------------------

16, 2022), 87 FR 16277 (March 22, 2022) (SR-CboeBZX-2022-015) 
(Notice of Filing and Immediate Effectiveness of a Proposed Rule 
Change To Amend the Fees Applicable to Various Market Data 
Products).
---------------------------------------------------------------------------

    For all of the foregoing reasons, the Exchange believes that the 
proposed fees for the NYSE Arca Agg Lite data feed are reasonable.
The Proposed Fees Are Equitably Allocated
    The Exchange believes the proposed fees for the NYSE Arca Agg Lite 
data feed are allocated fairly and equitably among the various 
categories of users of the feed, and any differences among categories 
of users are justified.
    Overall. The Exchange believes that the proposed fees are equitably 
allocated because they will apply to all data recipients that choose to 
subscribe to the NYSE Arca Agg Lite data feed. Any subscriber or vendor 
that chooses

[[Page 47647]]

to subscribe to the NYSE Arca Agg Lite data feed is subject to the same 
Fee Schedule, regardless of what type of business they operate or the 
use they plan to make of the data feed. Subscribers and vendors are not 
required to purchase the NYSE Arca Agg Lite data feed and may choose to 
receive the data on the NYSE Arca Agg Lite data feed regardless of what 
type of business they operate or the use they plan to make of the data 
feed.
    Access Fee. The Exchange believes the proposed monthly Access Fee 
of $1,500 for the NYSE Arca Agg Lite data feed is equitably allocated 
because it would be charged on an equal basis to all data recipients 
that receive a data feed of the NYSE Arca Agg Lite data feed, 
regardless of what type of business they operate or the use they plan 
to make of the data feed.
    User Fees. The Exchange believes that the fee structure 
differentiating Professional User fees ($30 per month per user) from 
Non-Professional User fees ($4 per month per user) for display device 
access to the NYSE Arca Agg Lite data feed is equitable. This structure 
has long been used by the Exchange to reduce the price of data to Non-
Professional Users and make it more broadly available.\48\ Offering the 
NYSE Arca Agg Lite data feed to Non-Professional Users with the same 
data as is available to Professional Users results in greater equity 
among data recipients. These user fees would be charged uniformly to 
all display devices that have access to the NYSE Arca Agg Lite data 
feed.
---------------------------------------------------------------------------

    \48\ See, e.g., Securities Exchange Act Release No. 72560 (July 
8, 2014), 79 FR 40801 (July 14, 2014) (SR-NYSEARCA-2014-72) 
(establishing tiered Non-Professional User Fees (Per User) for NYSE 
ArcaBook); Securities Exchange Act Release No. 20002, File No. S7-
433 (July 22, 1983), 48 FR 34552 (July 29, 1983) (establishing Non-
Professional fees for CTA data); NASDAQ BX Equity 7 Pricing 
Schedule, Section 123.
---------------------------------------------------------------------------

    Redistribution Fees. The Exchange believes the proposed monthly fee 
of $250 for redistributing the NYSE Arca Agg Lite data feed is 
equitably allocated because it would be charged on an equal basis to 
those Redistributors that choose to redistribute the feed.
    Enterprise Fees. The Exchange believes the proposed enterprise 
license is equitably allocated because it would be available on an 
equal basis to all subscribers that are broker-dealers, each of whom 
would benefit from reduced exchange fees and from lower administrative 
costs. Moreover, the specific feature of the proposed enterprise 
license that will allow subscribers to lower fees by subscribing to a 
twelve-month contract is also an equitable allocation because all 
subscribers will have the same option of choosing between the stability 
of a fixed, lower rate, and the more flexible option of maintaining the 
ability to change market data products after a month of service. 
Subscribers will be free to move from the monthly to the annual rate at 
any time, or from annual to a monthly fee, with notice, at the 
expiration of the twelve-month period.
    Non-Display Use Fees. The Exchange believes the proposed Non-
Display Use fees are equitably allocated because they would require 
subscribers to pay fees only for the uses they actually make of the 
data. As noted above, non-display data can be used by data recipients 
for a wide variety of profit-generating purposes (including trading, 
risk management, and compliance) as well as purposes that do not 
directly generate revenues but nonetheless substantially reduce the 
recipient's costs by automating certain functions. The Exchange 
believes that it is equitable to charge non-display data subscribers a 
$4,500 fee for each category of use they make of such data--namely, 
using the data on their own behalf (Category 1), on behalf of their 
clients (Category 2), and to internally match buy and sell orders 
within an organization (Category 3)--because this fee structure results 
in subscribers with greater uses of the data paying higher fees, and 
subscribers with fewer uses of the data paying lower fees. This 
segmented fee structure is also equitable because no subscriber of non-
display data would be charged a fee for a category of use in which it 
did not actually engage.
    The Exchange also believes that, regarding Category 3 fees, it is 
equitable to charge $4,500 per month for each trading platform on which 
the data recipient uses the Non-Display data, because such use of the 
data is directly in competition with the Exchange and the Exchange 
should be permitted to recoup some of its lost trading revenue by 
charging for the data that makes such competition possible. The 
Exchange believes that it is equitable to cap such fees for Category 3 
use at $13,500 per month per data recipient, because a higher monthly 
fee may potentially dissuade competitors from buying the NYSE Arca Agg 
Lite data feed for use by their trading platforms.
    Non-Display Use Declaration Late Fee. The Exchange believes that 
the proposed fee of $1,000 per month for a late Non-Display Use 
Declaration is equitably allocated because it applies to any data 
recipient that pays an Access Fee for the NYSE Arca Agg Lite data feed 
but has failed to complete and submit a Non-Display Use Declaration. In 
addition, the Exchange believes that it is equitable to charge a late 
fee to subscribers who fail to timely submit their Non-Display Use 
Declarations because their failure to do so leads to potentially 
incorrect billing and administrative burdens on the part of the 
Exchange. The Exchange believes it is equitable to defray these 
administrative costs by imposing a late fee only on subscribers' whose 
declarations were late, as opposed to all subscribers.
    Multiple Data Feed Fee. The Exchange believes that the $200 per 
month per location fee to data recipients taking the NYSE Arca Agg Lite 
data feed in more than two locations is equitable because it would 
apply to all such customers, regardless of what type of business they 
operate or the use they make of the data feed. In addition, the 
Exchange believes that it is equitable to charge a fee to subscribers 
for taking a data feed in more than two locations because there are 
administrative burdens on the part of the Exchange associated with 
tracking each location at which a data recipient receives the product. 
The Exchange believes that it is equitable for it to defray these 
administrative costs by imposing a modest fee only on subscribers who 
seek to take the feed in more than two locations, as opposed to all 
subscribers.
    Three-Month Fee Waiver. The Exchange believes the proposal to waive 
the Access Fee and the Redistribution Fee for the NYSE Arca Agg Lite 
data feed to new Redistributors for three calendar months is equitable 
because it would apply to any first-time Redistributor, regardless of 
the use they plan to make of the feed. As proposed, any first-time 
Redistributor of the NYSE Arca Agg Lite data feed would not be charged 
the Access Fee and the Redistribution Fee for three calendar months. 
The Exchange believes it is equitable to restrict the availability of 
this three-month fee waiver to Redistributors that have not previously 
subscribed to and redistributed the NYSE Arca Agg Lite data feed, since 
customers who are current or previous subscribers of the feed are 
already familiar with it and are able to determine whether it suits 
their needs.
    For all of the foregoing reasons, the Exchange believes that the 
proposed fees for the NYSE Arca Agg Lite data feed are equitably 
allocated.
The Proposed Fees Are Not Unfairly Discriminatory
    The Exchange believes the proposed fees for the NYSE Arca Agg Lite 
data feed are not unfairly discriminatory because any differences in 
the

[[Page 47648]]

application of the fees are based on meaningful distinctions between 
customers, and those meaningful distinctions are not unfairly 
discriminatory between customers.
    Overall. The Exchange believes that the proposed fees are not 
unfairly discriminatory because they would apply to all data recipients 
that choose to subscribe to the NYSE Arca Agg Lite data feed. Any 
subscriber, including Redistributor, that chooses to subscribe to the 
NYSE Arca Agg Lite data feed is subject to the same Fee Schedule, 
regardless of what type of business they operate or the use they plan 
to make of the data feed. Subscribers, including Redistributors, may 
choose to receive the data on the NYSE Arca Agg Lite data feed 
regardless of what type of business they operate or the use they plan 
to make of the data feed.
    Access Fee. The Exchange believes the proposed monthly Access Fee 
of $1,500 for the NYSE Arca Agg Lite data feed is not unfairly 
discriminatory because it would be charged on an equal basis to all 
data recipients that receive a data feed of the NYSE Arca Agg Lite, 
regardless of what type of business they operate or the use they plan 
to make of the data feed.
    User Fees. The Exchange believes that the fee structure 
differentiating Professional User fees ($30 per month per user) from 
Non-Professional User fees ($4 per month per user) for display device 
access to the NYSE Arca Agg Lite data feed is not unfairly 
discriminatory. This structure has long been used by the Exchange to 
reduce the price of data to Non-Professional Users and make it more 
broadly available.\49\ Offering the NYSE Arca Agg Lite data feed to 
Non-Professional Users with the same data as is available to 
Professional Users results in greater equity among data recipients. 
These user fees would be charged uniformly to all display devices that 
have access to the NYSE Arca Agg Lite data feed.

---------------------------------------------------------------------------

    Redistribution Fees. The Exchange believes the proposed monthly fee 
of $250 for redistributing the NYSE Arca Agg Lite data feed is not 
unfairly discriminatory because it would be charged on an equal basis 
to those Redistributors that choose to redistribute the feed.
    Enterprise Fees. The Exchange believes the proposed enterprise 
license will not unfairly discriminate between customers, issuers, 
brokers or dealers. The Act does not prohibit all distinctions among 
customers, but only discrimination that is unfair, and it is not unfair 
discrimination to charge those subscribers that are able to reach the 
largest audiences of investors, including retail investors, a lower fee 
for incremental investors in order to encourage the widespread 
distribution of market data. This principle has been repeatedly 
endorsed by the Commission, as evidenced by the approval of enterprise 
licenses for other market data products.\50\ Moreover, the proposed 
enterprise license will be subject to significant competition, and that 
competition will ensure that there is no unfair discrimination. Each 
subscriber will be able to accept or reject the license depending on 
whether it will or will not lower costs for that particular subscriber, 
and, if the license is not sufficiently competitive, the Exchange may 
lose market share. The proposed enterprise license will compete with 
other enterprise licenses of the Exchange, underlying fee schedules 
promulgated by the Exchange, and enterprise licenses and fee structures 
implemented by other exchanges. As such, it is a voluntary product for 
which market participants can readily find substitutes. Accordingly, 
the Exchange is constrained from introducing a fee that would be 
inequitable or unfairly discriminatory.
---------------------------------------------------------------------------

    \50\ See e.g., Securities Exchange Act Release No. 83751 (July 
31, 2018), 83 FR 38428 (August 6, 2018) (SR-NASDAQ-2018-058) (Notice 
of Filing and Immediate Effectiveness of Proposed Rule Change To 
Lower Fees and Administrative Costs for Distributors of Nasdaq 
Basic, Nasdaq Last Sale, NLS Plus and the Nasdaq Depth-of-Book 
Products Through a Consolidated Enterprise License).
---------------------------------------------------------------------------

    Non-Display Use Fees. The Exchange believes the proposed Non-
Display Use fees are not unfairly discriminatory because they would 
require subscribers for non-display use to pay fees only for the 
categories of use they actually make of the data. As noted above, non-
display data can be used by data recipients for a wide variety of 
profit-generating purposes (including trading, risk management, and 
compliance) as well as purposes that do not directly generate revenues 
but nonetheless substantially reduce the recipient's costs by 
automating certain functions. The Exchange believes that it is not 
unfairly discriminatory to charge non-display data subscribers a $4,500 
per month fee for each category of use they make of such data--namely, 
using the data on their own behalf (Category 1), on behalf of their 
clients (Category 2), and to internally match buy and sell orders 
within an organization (Category 3)--because this fee structure results 
in subscribers with greater uses for the data paying higher fees, while 
subscribers with fewer uses of the data pay lower fees. This segmented 
fee structure is not unfairly discriminatory because no subscriber of 
non-display data would be charged a fee for a category of use in which 
it did not actually engage.
    The Exchange also believes that, regarding Category 3 fees, it is 
not unreasonably discriminatory to charge $4,500 per month for each 
trading platform on which the data recipient uses the Non-Display data, 
because such use of the data is directly in competition with the 
Exchange and the Exchange should be permitted to recoup some of its 
lost trading revenue by charging for the data that makes such 
competition possible. The Exchange believes that it is not unreasonably 
discriminatory to cap such fees for Category 3 use at $13,500 per month 
per data recipient, because a higher monthly fee may potentially 
dissuade competitors from buying the NYSE Arca Agg Lite data feed for 
use by their trading platforms.
    Non-Display Use Declaration Late Fee. The Exchange believes that 
the proposed fee of $1,000 per month for a late Non-Display Use 
Declaration is not unfairly discriminatory because it applies to any 
data recipient that pays an Access Fee for the NYSE Arca Agg Lite data 
feed but has failed to complete and submit a Non-Display Use 
Declaration. In addition, the Exchange believes that it is not unfairly 
discriminatory to charge a late fee to subscribers who fail to timely 
submit their Non-Display Use Declarations because their failure to do 
so leads to potentially incorrect billing and administrative burdens on 
the part of the Exchange. Nor is it unfairly discriminatory for the 
Exchange to defray these administrative costs by imposing a late fee 
only on subscribers' whose declarations were late, as opposed to all 
subscribers.
    Multiple Data Feed Fee. The Exchange believes that the $200 per 
month per location fee to data recipients taking the NYSE Arca Agg Lite 
data feed in more than two locations is not unfairly discriminatory 
because it would apply to all such customers, regardless of what type 
of business they operate or the use they make of the data feed. In 
addition, the Exchange believes that it is not unfairly discriminatory 
to charge a fee to subscribers for taking a data feed in more than two 
locations because there are administrative burdens on the part of the 
Exchange associated with tracking each location at which a data 
recipient receives the product. The Exchange believes that it is not 
unfairly discriminatory for it to defray these administrative costs by 
imposing a modest fee only on subscribers who

[[Page 47649]]

seek to take the feed in more than two locations, as opposed to all 
subscribers.
    Three-Month Fee Waiver. The Exchange believes the proposal to waive 
the Access Fee and the Redistribution Fee for the NYSE Arca Agg Lite 
data feed to new Redistributors for three months is not unfairly 
discriminatory because it would apply to any first-time Redistributor, 
regardless of the use they plan to make of the feed. As proposed, any 
first-time Redistributor of the NYSE Arca Agg Lite data feed would not 
be charged the Access Fee and the Redistribution Fee for three calendar 
months. The Exchange believes it is not unfairly discriminatory to 
restrict the availability of this three-month fee waiver to 
Redistributors that have not previously subscribed to the NYSE Arca Agg 
Lite data feed, since Redistributors who are current or previous 
subscribers of the feed are already familiar with it and are able to 
determine whether it suits their needs.
    For all of the foregoing reasons, the Exchange believes that the 
proposed fees for the NYSE Arca Agg Lite data feed are not unfairly 
discriminatory.

B. Self-Regulatory Organization's Statement on Burden on Competition

    The Exchange does not believe that the proposed fees will impose 
any burden on competition that is not necessary or appropriate in 
furtherance of the purposes of the Act.
    Intramarket Competition. The Exchange believes that the proposed 
fees do not put any market participants at a relative disadvantage 
compared to other market participants. As noted above, the proposed fee 
schedule would apply to all subscribers, including Redistributors, of 
the NYSE Arca Agg Lite data feed, and customers may not only choose 
whether to subscribe to the feed at all, but may tailor their 
subscriptions by choosing particular uses of the feed but not others 
(e.g., Category 1 only versus all three categories; display device 
access only versus non-display use).
    The Exchange also believes that the proposed fees neither favor nor 
penalize one or more categories of market participants in a manner that 
would impose an undue market on competition. As shown above, to the 
extent that particular proposed fees apply to only a subset of 
subscribers (e.g., Category 2 fees apply only to those making non-
display use on behalf of clients; late fees apply only to customers who 
fail to timely submit their declarations), those distinctions are not 
unfairly discriminatory and do not unfairly burden one set of customers 
over another. To the contrary, by tailoring the proposed fees in this 
manner, the Exchange believes that it has eliminated the potential 
burden on competition that might result from unfairly asking 
subscribers to pay fees for services they did not use, or late fees 
they did not actually incur.
    Intermarket Competition. The Exchange believes that the proposed 
fees do not impose a burden on competition or on other SROs that is not 
necessary or appropriate. As noted above, exchanges are platforms for 
market data and trading. In setting the proposed fees, the Exchange was 
constrained by the availability of numerous substitute platforms also 
offering market data products and trading, and low barriers to entry 
mean new exchange platforms are frequently introduced. The fact that 
exchanges are platforms ensures that no exchange can make pricing 
decisions for one side of its platform without considering, and being 
constrained by, the effects that price will have on the other side of 
the platform. In setting fees for the NYSE Arca Agg Lite data feed, the 
Exchange is constrained by the fact that, if its pricing across the 
platform is unattractive to customers, customers will have its pick of 
an increasing number of alternative platforms to use instead of the 
Exchange. Given this intense competition between platforms, no one 
exchange's market data fees can impose an unnecessary burden on 
competition, and the Exchange's proposed fees do not do so here.
    In addition, the Exchange believes that the proposed fees do not 
impose a burden on competition or on other exchanges that is not 
necessary or appropriate because of the availability of numerous 
substitute market data products. Many other exchanges offer proprietary 
data feeds like the NYSE Arca Agg Lite data feed, supplying depth of 
book order data, security status updates, stock summary messages, and 
the exchange's best bid and offer at any given time, on a real-time 
basis. Because market data users can find suitable substitute feeds, an 
exchange that overprices its market data products stands a high risk 
that users may substitute another platform, in which case the platform 
would stand to lose both market data and trading fees. These 
competitive pressures ensure that no one exchange's market data fees 
can impose an unnecessary burden on competition, and the Exchange's 
proposed fees do not do so here.
