with respect to Syria and Iran, and certain provisions of the Iran 
Threat Reduction and Syria Human Rights Act of 2012, the Countering 
America's Adversaries Through Sanctions Act, and the Caesar Syria 
Civilian Protection Act of 2019. In addition to new prohibitions, OFAC

Background

    On April 5, 2005, OFAC issued the Syrian Sanctions Regulations, 31 
CFR part 542 (70 FR 17201, April 5, 2005) (the ``Regulations''), to 
implement Executive Order (E.O.) 13338 of May 11, 2004, ``Blocking 
Property of Certain Persons and Prohibiting the Export of Certain Goods 
to Syria'' (69 FR 26751, May 13, 2004), pursuant to authorities 
delegated to the Secretary of the Treasury in E.O. 13338. The 
Regulations were initially issued in abbreviated form for the purpose 
of providing immediate guidance to the public. On May 2, 2014, OFAC 
reissued the Regulations in their entirety (79 FR 25414, May 2, 2014), 
and, among other things, implemented E.O. 13399 of April 25, 2006 
(``Blocking Property of Additional Persons in Connection With the 
National Emergency With Respect to Syria'') (71 FR 25059, April 28, 
2006), E.O. 13460 of February 13, 2008 (``Blocking Property of 
Additional Persons in Connection With the National Emergency With 
Respect to Syria'') (73 FR 8991, February 15, 2008), E.O. 13572 of 
April 29, 2011 (``Blocking Property of Certain Persons With Respect to 
Human Rights Abuses in Syria'') (76 FR 24787, May 3, 2011), E.O. 13573 
of May 18, 2011 (``Blocking Property of Senior Officials of the 
Government of Syria '') (76 FR 29143, May 20, 2011), E.O. 13582 of 
August 17, 2011 (``Blocking Property of the Government of Syria and

[[Page 48311]]

Prohibiting Certain Transactions With Respect to Syria'') (76 FR 52209, 
August 22, 2011), and E.O. 13606 of April 22, 2012 (``Blocking the 
Property and Suspending Entry Into the United States of Certain Persons 
With Respect to Grave Human Rights Abuses by the Governments of Iran 
and Syria via Information Technology'') (77 FR 24571, April 24, 2012). 
OFAC has amended the Regulations several times, most recently on 
November 26, 2021 to expand an authorization related to certain 
activities of nongovernmental organizations in Syria (86 FR 67324, 
November 26, 2021).
    In this document, OFAC is further amending the Regulations to 
implement E.O. 13608 of May 1, 2012, ``Prohibiting Certain Transactions 
With and Suspending Entry Into the United States of Foreign Sanctions 
Evaders With Respect to Iran and Syria'' (77 FR 26409, May 3, 2012), 
the Syria Human Rights Accountability Act of 2012 (22 U.S.C. 8791 et 
seq.) (SHRAA), the Countering America's Adversaries Through Sanctions 
Act (22 U.S.C. 9401 et seq.) (CAATSA), and the Caesar Syria Civilian 
Protection Act of 2019 (Pub. L. 116-92, Div. F, Title LXXIV, 133 Stat. 
2290 (22 U.S.C. 8791 note)) (Caesar Act).

Executive and Statutory Authorities

    On May 11, 2004, the President, invoking the authority of, inter 
alia, the International Emergency Economic Powers Act (50 U.S.C. 1701 
et seq.) (IEEPA) and the Syria Accountability and Lebanese Sovereignty 
Restoration Act of 2003 (Pub. L. 108-175, 117 Stat. 2482 (22 U.S.C. 
2151 note)), issued E.O. 13338. In E.O. 13338, the President determined 
that the actions of the Government of Syria in supporting terrorism, 
continuing its occupation of Lebanon, pursuing weapons of mass 
destruction and missile programs, and undermining United States and 
international efforts with respect to the stabilization and 
reconstruction of Iraq constituted an unusual and extraordinary threat 
to the national security, foreign policy, and economy of the United 
States and declared a national emergency to deal with that threat.
    The national emergency declared in E.O. 13338 was subsequently 
modified in scope and relied upon for additional steps in E.O.s 13399, 
13460, 13572, 13573, 13582, 13606, and 13608, which were issued 
pursuant to, inter alia, IEEPA, and, among other things, blocked the 
property and interests in property that are or come within the United 
States or the possession or control of a U.S. person of the Government 
of Syria as well as of persons determined to meet certain criteria 
related to Syria, including persons engaged in human rights abuses. In 
addition, E.O. 13582 imposed new investment, services-related, and 
petroleum-related prohibitions involving Syria.
    E.O. 13608. On May 1, 2012, the President, invoking the authority 
of, inter alia, IEEPA, issued E.O. 13608, in which he found that 
efforts by foreign persons to engage in activities intended to evade 
U.S. economic and financial sanctions with respect to Iran and Syria 
undermine our efforts to address the national emergencies declared in, 
among others, E.O. 13338, as modified in scope and relied on for 
additional steps in subsequent Executive orders, and took additional 
steps pursuant to these national emergencies.
    Section 1(a) of E.O. 13608 authorizes the Secretary of the 
Treasury, in consultation with the Secretary of State, to impose the 
measures described in section 1(b) of E.O. 13608 on a foreign person 
upon determining that the foreign person: (i) has violated, attempted 
to violate, conspired to violate, or caused a violation of any license, 
order, regulation, or prohibition contained in, or issued pursuant to: 
(A) any Executive order relating to the national emergencies declared 
in E.O. 12957 of March 15, 1995, or in E.O. 13338 of May 11, 2004, as 
modified in scope in subsequent Executive orders; or (B) to the extent 
such conduct relates to property and interests in property of any 
person subject to United States sanctions concerning Iran or Syria, 
E.O. 13382 of June 28, 2005, any Executive order subsequent to E.O. 
13382 of June 28, 2005, that relates to the national emergency declared 
in E.O. 12938 of November 14, 1994, or any Executive order relating to 
the national emergency declared in E.O. 13224 of September 23, 2001; 
(ii) has facilitated deceptive transactions for or on behalf of any 
person subject to United States sanctions concerning Iran or Syria; or 
(iii) is owned or controlled by, or is acting or purporting to act for 
or on behalf of, directly or indirectly, any person determined to meet 
the criteria set forth in section 1(a) of E.O. 13608.
    Section 1(b) of E.O. 13608 describes the measures that the 
Secretary of the Treasury, in consultation with the Secretary of State, 
may impose on foreign persons determined to meet the criteria of 
section 1(a) of E.O. 13608. The measures that the Secretary of the 
Treasury may impose with respect to such foreign persons include 
prohibiting all transactions or dealings, whether direct or indirect, 
involving such person, including any exporting, reexporting, importing, 
selling, purchasing, transporting, swapping, brokering, approving, 
financing, facilitating, or guaranteeing, in or related to (i) any 
goods, services, or technology in or intended for the United States, or 
(ii) any goods, services, or technology provided by or to United States 
persons, wherever located.
    In section 2 of E.O. 13608, the President determined that the 
making of donations of the type of articles specified in section 
203(b)(2) of IEEPA (50 U.S.C. 1702(b)(2)), by, to, or for the benefit 
of any person subject to the measures described in section 1 of E.O. 
13608, would seriously impair the President's ability to deal with the 
national emergency declared in E.O. The President therefore prohibited 
the donation of such items except to the extent provided by statutes, 
or in regulations, orders, directives, or licenses that may be issued 
pursuant to E.O. 13608.
    Section 3 of E.O. 13608 provides that the prohibitions in section 1 
of E.O. 13608 include the making of any contribution or provision of 
funds, goods, or services by, to, or for the benefit of any person 
subject to the measures described in E.O. 13608, and the receipt of any 
contribution or provision of funds, goods, or services from any such 
person.
    Section 5 of E.O. 13608 prohibits any transaction by a U.S. person 
or within the United States that evades or avoids, has the purpose of 
evading or avoiding, causes a violation of, or attempts to violate any 
of the prohibitions set forth in E.O. 13608, as well as any conspiracy 
formed to violate such prohibitions.
    Section 6 of E.O. 13608 provides that nothing in section 1 of E.O. 
13608 shall prohibit transactions for the conduct of the official 
business of the United States government by employees, grantees, or 
contractors thereof.
    Section 9 of E.O. 13608 authorizes the Secretary of the Treasury, 
in consultation with the Secretary of State, to take such actions, 
including the promulgation of rules and regulations, and to employ all 
powers granted to the President by IEEPA, as may be necessary to carry 
out the purposes of the order. This section also provides that the 
Secretary of the Treasury may redelegate any of these functions to 
other officers and agencies of the U.S. government.
    Syria Human Rights Accountability Act of 2012 (SHRAA). On August 
10, 2012, the President signed the SHRAA into law as Title VII of the 
Iran Threat Reduction and Syria Human Rights Act of 2012 (Pub. L. 112-
158, Title VII, sec. 705, Aug. 10, 2012, 126 Stat. 1268.) (22

[[Page 48312]]

U.S.C. 8791 et seq.). Among other things, the SHRAA requires the 
President to impose sanctions including blocking of property, subject 
to such regulations as the President may prescribe, on persons included 
in a report to Congress that the President determined, among other 
things: (i) are officials of the Government of Syria or persons acting 
on behalf of the Government of Syria who are responsible for or 
complicit in, or responsible for ordering, controlling, or otherwise 
directing, the commission of serious human rights abuses against 
citizens of Syria or their family members, regardless of whether such 
abuses occurred in Syria; (ii) on or after August 10, 2012, have 
knowingly engaged in the transfer, or the facilitation of the transfer, 
to Syria of goods or technologies that the President determines are 
likely to be used by the Government of Syria or any of its agencies or 
instrumentalities to commit human rights abuses against the people of 
Syria, including certain firearms and ammunition, law enforcement 
equipment, surveillance technology, or sensitive technology, or have 
knowingly provided services with respect to such goods or technologies 
after such goods or technologies are transferred to Syria, as well as 
successor entities and certain persons that own or control or are owned 
or controlled by such persons, even if not included in the report; or 
(iii) have engaged in censorship, or activities relating to censorship, 
in a manner that prohibits, limits, or penalizes the legitimate 
exercise of freedom of expression by citizens of Syria.
    On October 9, 2012, the President delegated to the Secretary of the 
Treasury, in consultation with or at the recommendation of the 
Secretary of State, certain authorities with respect to the 
determinations and the imposition of IEEPA sanctions set out in the 
SHRAA. Further, the President delegated to the Secretary of State, in 
consultation with the Secretary of the Treasury, certain authorities 
with respect to the submission of reports set out in the SHRAA.
    Countering America's Adversaries Through Sanctions Act. On August 
2, 2017, the President signed CAATSA into law. Section 234(a) of CAATSA 
(22 U.S.C. 9528(a)), requires the President to impose sanctions, 
including blocking of property, on any foreign person determined by the 
President to, on or after August 2, 2017, have knowingly exported, 
transferred, or otherwise provided to Syria significant financial, 
material, or technological support that contributes materially to the 
ability of the Government of Syria to acquire or develop certain 
weapons or defense articles, as well as on any foreign person that is a 
successor entity to, is owned or controlled by, or has acted for or on 
behalf of, a foreign person sanctioned for engaging in such activities.
    On September 29, 2017, the President delegated the functions and 
authorities vested in the President by section 234(a) of CAATSA to the 
Secretary of State and the Secretary of the Treasury, to be exercised 
commensurate with authorizations in previous Presidential actions. In 
addition, the President delegated the functions and authorities vested 
in the President by section 234(b)(1) of CAATSA (22 U.S.C. 9528(b)(1)), 
which sets forth the blocking of property as an available sanction, to 
the Secretary of the Treasury, in consultation with the Secretary of 
State.
    Caesar Syria Civilian Protection Act of 2019. On December 20, 2019, 
the President signed the Caesar Act into law as Title LXXIV of the 
National Defense Authorization Act for Fiscal Year 2020 (Pub. L. 116-
92, Div. F, Title LXXIV, 133 Stat. 2290 (22 U.S.C. 8791 note)). Among 
other things, section 7412 of the Caesar Act requires the President to 
impose sanctions, including blocking of property, on any foreign person 
determined by the President to knowingly, on or after June 17, 2020, 
engage in certain activities, including to knowingly provide 
significant financial, material, or technological support to, or 
knowingly engage in a significant transaction with, the Government of 
Syria, a senior political figure of the Government of Syria, a foreign 
person that is a military contractor, mercenary, or paramilitary force 
in certain cases, or a foreign person subject to U.S. sanctions laws 
with respect to Syria.
    On March 31, 2020, the President delegated to the Secretary of the 
Treasury, in consultation with Secretary of State, certain authorities 
with respect to the determinations and the imposition of IEEPA 
sanctions set out in the Caesar Act.

Current Regulatory Action

    OFAC is amending the Regulations to implement the provisions 
related to Syria of E.O. 13608, SHRAA, CAATSA, and the Caesar Act 
described above. In subpart B of the Regulations, which implements the 
prohibitions contained in the various Executive orders and statutes, 
OFAC is adding to Sec.  542.201 the prohibitions set forth pursuant to 
sections 702 through 704 of the SHRAA; section 234 of CAATSA; section 
7412 of the Caesar Act; and the prohibitions contained in any further 
Executive orders issued pursuant to the national emergency declared in 
E.O. 13338. In addition, OFAC is adding Sec.  542.212 to the 
Regulations to implement the restrictions on foreign persons determined 
to be foreign sanctions evaders pursuant to sections 1 and 5 of E.O. 
13608. Persons blocked pursuant to Sec.  542.201, including persons 
blocked pursuant to the criteria being added to Sec.  542.201 through 
this amendment, are referred to throughout the Regulations as ``persons 
whose property and interests in property are blocked pursuant to Sec.  
542.201.'' The names of persons designated or identified as blocked 
pursuant to Sec.  542.201 are published on OFAC's Specially Designated 
Nationals and Blocked Persons List (SDN List), which is accessible via 
OFAC's website, and published in the Federal Register. The names of 
persons who are determined to be subject to the prohibitions of Sec.  
542.212 are published on OFAC's Foreign Sanctions Evaders (FSE) List, 
which is also accessible via OFAC's website, and published in the 
Federal Register. Also in subpart B, OFAC is adding to Sec.  542.211 a 
paragraph that explains that the exemptions of the section do not apply 
to persons blocked pursuant to the authority of the United Nations 
Participation Act, as well as adding the exemption relating to the 
official business of the United States Government in section 6 of E.O. 
13608 and the exemption relating to the importation of goods in section 
7434 of the Caesar Act.
    In subpart C of the Regulations, new definitions are being added 
for the terms ``construction or engineering services,'' ``deceptive 
transaction,'' ``foreign person,'' ``knowingly,'' ``person subject to 
United States sanctions concerning Syria,'' and ``sensitive 
technology.'' Because these new definitions were inserted in 
alphabetical order, the definitions that were in the prior set of 
regulations have been renumbered. In subpart D, which contains 
interpretive sections regarding the Regulations, Sec.  542.405 has been 
renamed and updated to reflect that the receipt of services from a 
person whose property and interests in property are blocked pursuant to 
Sec.  542.201 is also prohibited pursuant to Sec.  542.201. OFAC is 
also adding two new interpretive sections: Sec.  542.414 provides 
guidance on significant or significance; and Sec.  542.415 clarifies 
that foreign persons will not be subject to sanctions pursuant to 
certain sections solely on the basis of a transaction for which a U.S. 
person would not require a specific license.
    In subpart E, which sets forth general licenses and statements of 
licensing

[[Page 48313]]

policy for transactions otherwise prohibited by the Regulations but 
found to be consistent with U.S. policy, OFAC is adding a new general 
license at Sec.  542.534 to authorize any transaction prohibited 
pursuant to Sec.  542.212 due to the involvement of a person determined 
to be subject to the prohibitions of Sec.  542.212, to the same extent 
such transaction would be authorized for a person whose property and 
interests in property are blocked pursuant to Sec.  542.201 by a 
general license issued pursuant to this part.
    OFAC is also incorporating, in new Sec.  542.533, Syria General 
License 22, which authorizes activities in certain economic sectors in 
non-regime held areas of northeast and northwest Syria and was 
previously issued only on OFAC's website. General License 22 was issued 
on May 12, 2022 and will be removed from OFAC's website upon 
publication of this rule.
    OFAC is also updating the general license at Sec.  542.511 for the 
export of certain services incident to internet-based communications to 
reflect changes in the technologies that underlie modern communication 
tools. These changes include listing additional technologies that are 
deemed incident to the exchange of communications over the internet and 
expanding the scope of the authorization to cover the exportation or 
reexportation of services incident to the exportation or reexportation 
of software or hardware incident to the exchange of communications over 
the internet. The authorization is also being updated to explicitly 
exclude the direct or indirect exportation of web-hosting services that 
are for websites of commercial entities located in Syria or of domain 
name registration services for or on behalf of the Government of Syria 
or a person whose property and interests in property are blocked 
pursuant to Sec.  542.201. The updated Sec.  542.511 also includes a 
statement of licensing policy providing a case-by-case review standard 
for applications for the exportation or reexportation of services, 
including services incident to the exportation or reexportation of 
software or hardware, that are incident to communications, involve the 
telecommunications sector, or that support internet freedom in Syria. 
Accordingly, OFAC is also removing the statement of licensing policy on 
activities related to the telecommunications sector that previously 
appeared at Sec.  542.527 and reserving the section.
    As a continuation of OFAC's efforts to ensure that humanitarian 
assistance and related trade continues to reach at-risk populations 
through legitimate and transparent channels, while maintaining the 
effective use of targeted sanctions, OFAC is amending two general 
licenses at Sec. Sec.  542.513 and 542.516. In Sec.  542.513, which 
authorizes official business of certain international organizations and 
entities, OFAC is removing the requirement that contractors or grantees 
must provide a copy of their contract or grant and identifying 
additional international organizations and entities covered. In Sec.  
542.516, which authorizes certain services in support of 
nongovernmental organizations' activities, OFAC is revising the 
authorization to align more closely with similar authorizations in 
other parts of 31 CFR chapter V.
    OFAC is also revising general licenses at: Sec.  542.507, to 
clarify that U.S. persons do not need to obtain specific authorization 
to provide services related to authorized legal services; Sec.  
542.508, to remove the requirements that U.S. persons provide a copy of 
the engagement letter to OFAC prior to receiving payment and submit 
quarterly reports, and to instead require U.S. persons to retain 
records of such payments for five years; and Sec.  542.531, to align 
the authorization for emergency medical services with similar 
authorizations in other parts of 31 CFR chapter V.
    OFAC is reissuing subpart G, Penalties, to add Sec.  542.705, which 
describes Findings of Violations, and make other technical updates to 
the subpart (for example, to account for submission by email). OFAC is 
also reorganizing the part by moving Sec. Sec.  542.601, 541.801, and 
542.901 to subpart A, revising and moving Sec.  542.802 to subpart A, 
renaming the subpart, reserving subpart F, and removing subparts H and 
I. Finally, throughout the part, OFAC is making technical and 
conforming updates to certain provisions and updating cross references.

Public Participation

    Because the Regulations involve a foreign affairs function, the 
provisions of E.O. 12866 of September 30, 1993, ``Regulatory Planning 
and Review'' (58 FR 51735, October 4, 1993), and the Administrative 
Procedure Act (5 U.S.C. 553) requiring notice of proposed rulemaking, 
opportunity for public participation, and delay in effective date are 
inapplicable. Because no notice of proposed rulemaking is required for 
this rule, the Regulatory Flexibility Act (5 U.S.C. 601-612) does not 
apply.

Paperwork Reduction Act

    The collections of information related to the Regulations are 
contained in 31 CFR part 501 (the ``Reporting, Procedures and Penalties 
Regulations''). Pursuant to the Paperwork Reduction Act of 1995 (44 
U.S.C. 3507), those collections of information have been approved by 
the Office of Management and Budget under control number 1505-0164. An 
agency may not conduct or sponsor, and a person is not required to 
respond to, a collection of information unless the collection of 
information displays a valid control number.

of any regulation, ruling, instruction, order, directive, or license 
issued by or pursuant to the direction or authorization of the 
Secretary of the Treasury pursuant to this part or otherwise under 
IEEPA.

    (2) IEEPA provides for a maximum civil penalty not to exceed the 
greater of $368,136 or an amount that is twice the amount of the 
transaction that is the basis of the violation with respect to which 
the penalty is imposed.
    (3) A person who willfully commits, willfully attempts to commit, 
willfully conspires to commit, or aids or abets in the commission of a

Government of the United States, knowingly and willfully falsifies, 
conceals, or covers up by any trick, scheme, or device a material fact; 
or makes any materially false, fictitious, or fraudulent statement or

[[Page 48323]]

or imprisoned for not more than 10 years, or both.
    (f) Violations of this part may also be subject to other applicable 
laws.


Sec.  542.702   Pre-Penalty Notice; settlement.

    (a) When required. If OFAC has reason to believe that there has 
occurred a violation of any provision of this part or a violation of 
the provisions of any regulation, ruling, instruction, order, 
directive, or license issued by or pursuant to the direction or 
authorization of the Secretary of the Treasury pursuant to this part or 
otherwise under the International Emergency Economic Powers Act (50 
U.S.C. 1701 et seq.) and determines that a civil monetary penalty is 
warranted, OFAC will issue a Pre-Penalty Notice informing the alleged 
violator of the agency's intent to impose a monetary penalty. A Pre-
Penalty Notice shall be in writing. The Pre-Penalty Notice may be 
issued whether or not another agency has taken any action with respect 
to the matter. For a description of the contents of a Pre-Penalty 
Notice, see appendix A to part 501 of this chapter.
    (b) Response--(1) Right to respond. An alleged violator has the 
right to respond to a Pre-Penalty Notice by making a written 
presentation to OFAC. For a description of the information that should 
be included in such a response, see appendix A to part 501 of this 
chapter.
    (2) Deadline for response. A response to a Pre-Penalty Notice must 
be made within 30 days as set forth in paragraphs (b)(2)(i) and (ii) of 
this section. The failure to submit a response within 30 days shall be 
deemed to be a waiver of the right to respond.
    (i) Computation of time for response. A response to a Pre-Penalty 
Notice must be postmarked or date-stamped by the U.S. Postal Service 
(or foreign postal service, if mailed abroad) or courier service 
provider (if transmitted to OFAC by courier), or dated if sent by 
email, on or before the 30th day after the postmark date on the 
envelope in which the Pre-Penalty Notice was mailed or date the Pre-
Penalty Notice was emailed. If the Pre-Penalty Notice was personally 
delivered by a non-U.S. Postal Service agent authorized by OFAC, a 
response must be postmarked or date-stamped on or before the 30th day 
after the date of delivery.
    (ii) Extensions of time for response. If a due date falls on a 
Federal holiday or weekend, that due date is extended to include the 
following business day. Any other extensions of time will be granted, 
at the discretion of OFAC, only upon specific request to OFAC.
    (3) Form and method of response. A response to a Pre-Penalty Notice 
need not be in any particular form, but it must be typewritten and 
signed by the alleged violator or a representative thereof (electronic 
signature is acceptable), contain information sufficient to indicate 
that it is in response to the Pre-Penalty Notice, and include the OFAC 
identification number listed on the Pre-Penalty Notice. The response 
must be sent to OFAC's Enforcement Division by mail or courier or email 
and must be postmarked or date-stamped in accordance with paragraph 
(b)(2) of this section.
    (c) Settlement. Settlement discussion may be initiated by OFAC, the 
alleged violator, or the alleged violator's authorized representative. 
For a description of practices with respect to settlement, see appendix 
A to part 501 of this chapter.
    (d) Guidelines. Guidelines for the imposition or settlement of 
civil penalties by OFAC are contained in appendix A to part 501 of this 
chapter.
    (e) Representation. A representative of the alleged violator may 
act on behalf of the alleged violator, but any oral communication with 
OFAC prior to a written submission regarding the specific allegations 
contained in the Pre-Penalty Notice must be preceded by a written 
letter of representation, unless the Pre-Penalty Notice was served upon 
the alleged violator in care of the representative.


Sec.  542.703  Penalty imposition.

    If, after considering any written response to the Pre-Penalty 
Notice and any relevant facts, OFAC determines that there was a 
violation by the alleged violator named in the Pre-Penalty Notice and 
that a civil monetary penalty is appropriate, OFAC may issue a Penalty 
Notice to the violator containing a determination of the violation and 
the imposition of the monetary penalty. For additional details 
concerning issuance of a Penalty Notice, see appendix A to part 501 of 
this chapter. The issuance of the Penalty Notice shall constitute final 
agency action. The violator has the right to seek judicial review of 
that final agency action in Federal district court.


Sec.  542.704   Administrative collection; referral to United States 
Department of Justice.

    In the event that the violator does not pay the penalty imposed 
pursuant to this part or make payment arrangements acceptable to OFAC, 
the matter may be referred for administrative collection measures by 
the Department of the Treasury or to the United States Department of 
Justice for appropriate action to recover the penalty in a civil suit 
in a Federal district court.


Sec.  542.705  Findings of Violation.

    (a) When issued. (1) OFAC may issue an initial Finding of Violation 
that identifies a violation if OFAC:
    (i) Determines that there has occurred a violation of any provision 
of this part, or a violation of the provisions of any regulation, 
ruling, instruction, order, directive, or license issued by or pursuant 
to the direction or authorization of the Secretary of the Treasury 
pursuant to this part or otherwise under the International Emergency 
Economic Powers Act (50 U.S.C. 1701 et seq.);
    (ii) Considers it important to document the occurrence of a 
violation; and
    (iii) Based on the Guidelines contained in appendix A to part 501 
of this chapter, concludes that an administrative response is warranted 
but that a civil monetary penalty is not the most appropriate response.
    (2) An initial Finding of Violation shall be in writing and may be 
issued whether or not another agency has taken any action with respect 
to the matter. For additional details concerning issuance of a Finding 
of Violation, see appendix A to part 501 of this chapter.
    (b) Response--(1) Right to respond. An alleged violator has the 
right to contest an initial Finding of Violation by providing a written 
response to OFAC.
    (2) Deadline for response; default determination. A response to an 
initial Finding of Violation must be made within 30 days as set forth 
in paragraphs (b)(2)(i) and (ii) of this section. The failure to submit 
a response within 30 days shall be deemed to be a waiver of the right 
to respond, and the initial Finding of Violation will become final and 
will constitute final agency action. The violator has the right to seek 
judicial review of that final agency action in Federal district court.
    (i) Computation of time for response. A response to an initial 
Finding of Violation must be postmarked or date-stamped by the U.S. 
Postal Service (or foreign postal service, if mailed abroad) or courier 
service provider (if transmitted to OFAC by courier), or dated if sent 
by email, on or before the 30th day after the postmark date on the 
envelope in which the initial Finding of Violation was served or date 
the Finding of Violation was sent by email. If the initial Finding of 
Violation was personally delivered by a non-U.S. Postal Service agent 
authorized by OFAC, a response must be postmarked

[[Page 48324]]

or date-stamped on or before the 30th day after the date of delivery.
    (ii) Extensions of time for response. If a due date falls on a 
Federal holiday or weekend, that due date is extended to include the 
following business day. Any other extensions of time will be granted, 
at the discretion of OFAC, only upon specific request to OFAC.
    (3) Form and method of response. A response to an initial Finding 
of Violation need not be in any particular form, but it must be 
typewritten and signed by the alleged violator or a representative 
thereof (electronic signature is acceptable), contain information 
sufficient to indicate that it is in response to the initial Finding of 
Violation, and include the OFAC identification number listed on the 
initial Finding of Violation. The response must be sent to OFAC's 
Enforcement Division by mail or courier or email and must be postmarked 
or date-stamped in accordance with paragraph (b)(2) of this section.
    (4) Information that should be included in response. Any response 
should set forth in detail why the alleged violator either believes 
that a violation of the regulations in this part did not occur and/or 
why a Finding of Violation is otherwise unwarranted under the 
circumstances, with reference to the General Factors Affecting 
Administrative Action set forth in the Guidelines contained in appendix 
A to part 501 of this chapter. The response should include all 
documentary or other evidence available to the alleged violator that 
supports the arguments set forth in the response. OFAC will consider 
all relevant materials submitted in the response.
    (c) Determination--(1) Determination that a Finding of Violation is 
warranted. If, after considering the response, OFAC determines that a 
final Finding of Violation should be issued, OFAC will issue a final 
Finding of Violation that will inform the violator of its decision. A 
final Finding of Violation shall constitute final agency action. The 
violator has the right to seek judicial review of that final agency 
action in Federal district court.
    (2) Determination that a Finding of Violation is not warranted. If, 
after considering the response, OFAC determines a Finding of Violation 
is not warranted, then OFAC will inform the alleged violator of its 
decision not to issue a final Finding of Violation.

    Note 1 to paragraph (c)(2).  A determination by OFAC that a 
final Finding of Violation is not warranted does not preclude OFAC 
from pursuing other enforcement actions consistent with the 
Guidelines contained in appendix A to part 501 of this chapter.

    (d) Representation. A representative of the alleged violator may 
act on behalf of the alleged violator, but any oral communication with 
OFAC prior to a written submission regarding the specific alleged 
violations contained in the initial Finding of Violation must be 
preceded by a written letter of representation, unless the initial 
Finding of Violation was served upon the alleged violator in care of 
the representative.
