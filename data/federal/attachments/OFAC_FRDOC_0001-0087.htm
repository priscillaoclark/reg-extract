Background

    The Cuban Assets Control Regulations, 31 CFR part 515 (``CACR''), 
were issued by the U.S. Government on July 8, 1963, under the Trading 
With the Enemy Act (50 U.S.C. App. 5 et seq.). Today, OFAC is amending 
the CACR to implement measures announced by the President on April 13, 
2009, to promote

[[Page 46001]]

greater contact between separated family members in the United States 
and Cuba and to increase the flow of remittances and information to the 
Cuban people. OFAC also is amending the CACR to implement certain 
provisions of the Omnibus Appropriations Act, 2009 (Pub. L. 111-8, 123 
Stat. 524) (``Appropriations Act''), as well as to make certain 
technical and conforming changes.
    Travel to visit close relatives in Cuba. Sections 515.560 and 
515.561 are amended to make a number of changes to the rules regarding 
travel-related transactions incident to visiting relatives in Cuba. 
Pursuant to July 2004 amendments to the CACR, and prior to March 11, 
2009, OFAC issued specific licenses on a case-by-case basis to persons 
subject to the jurisdiction of the United States for visits, no more 
than once every three years and for a period not to exceed 14 days, to 
a member of the person's ``immediate family'' (defined as any spouse, 
child, grandchild, parent, grandparent, or sibling of the traveler or 
the traveler's spouse, as well as any spouse, widow, or widower of any 
of the foregoing) who was a national of Cuba. A licensed traveler was 
authorized to spend up to $50 a day for living expenses in Cuba and an 
additional $50 per trip to cover transportation-related expenses within 
Cuba as necessary. Any individual accompanying a licensed family 
traveler had to separately qualify for a family travel specific 
license. Also pursuant to the July 2004 amendments to the CACR, and 
prior to March 11, 2009, persons subject to the jurisdiction of the 
United States who wished to visit a family member who was not a 
national of Cuba (e.g., a U.S. national traveling in Cuba pursuant to 
an OFAC license) had to obtain a specific license that would only be 
issued in certain exigent circumstances.
    In response to Section 621 of the Appropriations Act, which 
prohibited the expenditure of Fiscal Year 2009 appropriated funds to 
administer, implement, or enforce the July 2004 CACR amendments related 
to family travel, OFAC issued a general license and a new statement of 
specific licensing policy on its Web site. These new provisions, which 
were issued on March 11, 2009, reverted to the family travel policy 
that had been in place immediately prior to the July 2004 amendments. 
This March 11 general license authorized one trip per year to visit a 
broader category of ``close relatives'' (including, for example, aunts, 
uncles, cousins, and second cousins) who were nationals of Cuba. The 
March 11 general license contained no limit on the duration of such a 
visit and increased the authorized expenditures in Cuba to match the 
expenditures allowed for all other authorized categories of travel--the 
current State Department per diem for Havana (for use anywhere in Cuba) 
plus amounts for additional transactions directly incident to visiting 
close relatives in Cuba. The general license also authorized family 
travelers to be accompanied by persons who share a common dwelling as a 
family with them. For visits to family who were not nationals of Cuba, 
the March 11 statement of specific licensing policy provided for case-
by-case authorization of visits to the broader category of ``close 
relatives'' without the former exigent circumstances limitation.
    OFAC is amending section 515.561 to reflect the March 11 general 
license issued on OFAC's Web site and to further expand this 
authorization by removing the once per year frequency limitation, so 
that family travelers can now visit their close relatives as often as 
they wish. OFAC also is extending this authorization to close relatives 
of U.S. Government employees assigned to the U.S. Interests Section in 
Havana. Accordingly, prior paragraph (a) of section 515.561 is replaced 
by two new general licenses. New paragraph (a)(1) of section 515.561 
contains a general license authorizing the travel-related transactions 
set forth in section 515.560(c) and additional transactions that are 
directly incident to visiting a close relative who is a national of 
Cuba, as that term is defined in section 515.302. New paragraph (a)(2) 
of section 515.561 provides this same authorization for visits to a 
close relative who is a U.S. Government employee assigned to the U.S. 
Interests Section in Havana.
    The term ``close relative'' is defined in new section 515.339 as 
any individual related to a person by blood, marriage, or adoption who 
is no more than three generations removed from that person or from a 
common ancestor with that person. Both new general licenses contained 
in paragraphs (a)(1) and (a)(2) of section 515.561 authorize persons 
who share a common dwelling as a family with a licensed family traveler 
to accompany the licensed traveler on a family visit.
    OFAC also is amending section 515.561 to reflect the March 11 
statement of specific licensing policy published on OFAC's Web site 
with respect to visits to family members who are not nationals of Cuba. 
Accordingly, the specific licensing policy in paragraph (b) of section 
515.561 is amended to apply to visits to ``close relatives'' (as 
defined in new section 515.339) and to remove the requirement that 
certain exigent circumstances must exist for a license to be issued.
    OFAC is amending section 515.560(c)(2) by removing the $50 per day 
limit on living expenses in Cuba, as well as the $50 per trip limit on 
transportation-related expenses within Cuba, that formerly applied to 
licensed family visits. New section 515.560(c)(2) authorizes all 
transactions ordinarily incident to travel anywhere in Cuba, including 
payment of living expenses and the acquisition in Cuba of goods for 
personal consumption there, that do not exceed the ``maximum per diem 
rate,'' as established by the Department of State for Havana, Cuba, in 
effect at the time travel to Cuba takes place. The current ``maximum 
per diem rate'' may be found on the Department of State's Office of 
Allowances Web site (<A HREF="http://frwebgate.access.gpo.gov/cgi-bin/leaving.cgi?from=leavingFR.html&log=linklog&to=http://aoprals.state.gov">http://aoprals.state.gov</A>). Nothing in these 
amendments authorizes the importation into the United States of any 
merchandise purchased or otherwise acquired in Cuba. The Commerce 
Department's Bureau of Industry and Security is separately amending its 
regulations to remove the weight restriction on authorized baggage 
carried by travelers to Cuba.
    Remittances to nationals of Cuba. Prior to these amendments, 
remittances from persons subject to the jurisdiction of the United 
States to nationals of Cuba were limited to ``immediate family'' of the 
remitter and capped at $300 per recipient household in any consecutive 
three-month period. OFAC is amending paragraph (a) of section 515.570 
to remove all limitations on the amount and frequency with which 
persons subject to the jurisdiction of the United States may make 
authorized remittances to nationals of Cuba and to expand the category 
of permitted recipients to ``close relatives,'' as defined in new 
section 515.339. These amendments do not affect the prohibition on 
remittances to a ``prohibited official of the Government of Cuba'' or a 
``prohibited member of the Cuban Communist Party.'' The definitions of 
those terms have been moved to new sections 515.337 and 515.338, 
respectively. The general license that existed in paragraph (a) prior 
to these amendments authorizing periodic $300 remittances from a 
blocked account to a recipient in a third country in whose name, or for 
whose beneficial interest, the account is held has been moved to 
paragraph (c).
    OFAC is amending paragraph (b) of section 515.570, which authorizes 
two separate one-time emigration-related remittances, to increase the 
value limit of each of these remittances from $500

[[Page 46002]]

to $1,000. This change is being made to reflect increases in 
emigration-related expenses since the original $500 caps were set in 
1991.
    To track the amendments to paragraphs (a) and (b) of section 
515.570, and subject to certain conditions, OFAC is amending paragraph 
(c) of section 515.570 to authorize unlimited remittances from an 
inherited blocked account in a banking institution in the United States 
to the account holder if s/he is a close relative of the decedent, as 
defined in new section 515.339, as well as limited emigration-related 
remittances from inherited blocked accounts. As noted above, amended 
paragraph (c) also authorizes remittances of up to $300 in any 
consecutive three-month period from any blocked account (including an 
account with funds other than inherited funds) to a Cuban national in a 
third country who is an individual in whose name, or for whose 
beneficial interest, the account is held.
    OFAC also is amending paragraph (c)(4)(i) and paragraph (d)(2) of 
section 515.560. The changes to paragraph (c)(4)(i) of section 515.560 
increase from $300 to $3,000 the total amount of family remittances an 
authorized traveler may carry to Cuba. The changes to paragraph (d)(2) 
of section 515.560 increase from $300 to $3,000 the amount of funds 
received as remittances that a national of Cuba departing the United 
States may carry.
    Remittance-related transactions by banks and other depository 
institutions. A new general license in amended paragraph (a)(3) of 
section 515.572 authorizes depository institutions to act as forwarders 
for remittances. A depository institution, as defined in section 
515.333, no longer needs specific authorization from OFAC to provide 
services as a remittance forwarder. However, depository institutions 
and licensed remittance forwarders are required to collect from persons 
who use their services information showing compliance with the 
remittance provisions in this part. Depository institutions are 
permitted to set up testing arrangements and exchange authenticator 
keys with Cuban financial institutions to forward remittances 
authorized by or pursuant to section 515.570 but may not open or use 
direct correspondent accounts of their own with Cuban financial 
institutions.
    Certain telecommunications services, contracts, related payments, 
and travel-related transactions authorized. OFAC is making substantial 
revisions to section 515.542 to implement the President's directive 
related to increasing the flow of information to the Cuban people. 
Paragraph (b) is amended to authorize all transactions, including but 
not limited to payments, incident to the provision of 
telecommunications services between the United States and Cuba, the 
provision of satellite radio or satellite television services to Cuba, 
or the entry into and performance under roaming service agreements with 
telecommunications services providers in Cuba, by a telecommunications 
services provider that is a person subject to U.S. jurisdiction. Former 
paragraph (c), which set forth a case-by-case licensing policy for 
payments to Cuba for authorized telecommunications services, is removed 
in light of paragraph (b)'s new general license authorizing such 
payments. Paragraph (b) does not authorize the entry into or 
performance of a contract with or for the benefit of any particular 
individual in Cuba or any transactions incident to the establishment of 
facilities to provide telecommunications services linking the United 
States and Cuba or third countries and Cuba. These activities are 
covered instead by new paragraphs (c), (d)(1), and (d)(2).
    New paragraph (c) of section 515.542 authorizes all persons subject 
to U.S. jurisdiction to enter into, and make payments under, contracts 
with non-Cuban telecommunications services providers, or particular 
individuals in Cuba, for services provided to particular individuals in 
Cuba, such as a contract for cellular telephone service for a phone 
owned and used by a particular individual in Cuba, provided that the 
individual is not a prohibited official of the Government of Cuba or a 
prohibited member of the Cuban Communist Party, as defined in sections 
515.337 and 515.338, respectively. The authorization in new paragraph 
(c) includes, but is not limited to, payment for activation, 
installation, usage (monthly, pre-paid, intermittent, or other), 
roaming, maintenance, and termination fees.
    Newly added paragraph (d)(1) of section 515.542 contains a general 
license authorizing transactions incident to the establishment of 
facilities to provide telecommunications services linking the United 
States and Cuba, including but not limited to fiber-optic cable and 
satellite telecommunications facilities. Newly added paragraph (d)(2) 
provides a statement of specific licensing policy with respect to 
transactions incident to the establishment of facilities to provide 
telecommunications services linking third countries and Cuba, including 
but not limited to fiber-optic cable and satellite facilities, provided 
that such facilities are necessary to provide efficient and adequate 
telecommunications services between the United States and Cuba. 
Additional newly added paragraphs set out certain reporting 
requirements and clarifications.
    Travel-related transactions incident to these new authorizations in 
section 515.542 are addressed by amendments to sections 515.564 and 
515.533. New paragraph (a)(3) of section 515.564 provides a general 
license authorizing, with certain conditions, the travel-related 
transactions set forth in section 515.560(c) and additional 
transactions that are directly incident to participation in 
professional meetings for the commercial marketing of, sales 
negotiation for, or performance under contracts for the provision of 
the telecommunications services, or the establishment of facilities to 
provide telecommunications services, authorized by the general licenses 
in section 515.542. With respect to those commercial telecommunications 
transactions that will require Commerce-authorized exports of 
telecommunications-related items, new paragraph (f) of section 515.533 
provides a general license authorizing, with certain conditions, the 
travel-related transactions set forth in section 515.560(c) and 
additional transactions that are directly incident to the commercial 
marketing, sales negotiation, accompanied delivery, or servicing in 
Cuba of telecommunications-related items that have been authorized for 
commercial export or re-export to Cuba by the Department of Commerce.
    Travel-related transactions incident to agricultural and medical 
sales authorized. OFAC is amending section 515.533 of the CACR to add 
new paragraph (e) authorizing certain travel-related transactions 
(former paragraph (e) has been redesignated as paragraph (g)). Pursuant 
to Section 620 of the Appropriations Act, which amended section 910(a) 
of the Trade Sanctions Reform and Export Enhancement Act of 2000 (22 
U.S.C. 7209(a)), new paragraph (e) contains a general license 
authorizing, with certain conditions, the travel-related transactions 
set forth in section 515.560(c) and additional transactions that are 
directly incident to the commercial marketing, sales negotiation, 
accompanied delivery, or servicing in Cuba of agricultural commodities, 
medicine, or medical devices that appear consistent with the export or 
re-export licensing policy of the Department of Commerce.
    Authorization of most transactions of Cuban nationals lawfully 
present in the United States in a non-visitor status.

[[Page 46003]]

Amendments to the CACR published March 24, 2003 (68 FR 14141), added a 
new general license at paragraph (c) of section 515.505 authorizing 
most transactions with Cuban national individuals who are granted 
humanitarian or other parole into the United States and remain in the 
United States pursuant to that grant of parole. This general license 
was intended to apply to all Cuban nationals who are lawfully present 
in the United States other than those who are in the United States on a 
temporary basis (e.g., an individual on a non-immigrant visa valid only 
for a specified period). The requirement that a Cuban national 
individual be paroled into the United States in order to be covered by 
the general license resulted in the unintended exclusion of Cuban 
national individuals who are lawfully present in the United States in a 
non-visitor status but who are not in a paroled status (e.g., those 
granted refugee status).
    OFAC is amending paragraph (c) of section 515.505 to eliminate this 
unintended limitation by replacing the requirement that the individual 
be a national of Cuba ``who has been paroled into the United States'' 
with a requirement that the individual be a national of Cuba ``who is 
lawfully present in the United States in a non-visitor status.'' A 
sentence is added to paragraph (c) explaining that the term non-visitor 
status does not apply to an individual who is present in the United 
States on a non-immigrant visa valid only for a specified period of 
time. Conforming amendments are made to paragraph (e)(2), which 
contains an example of the application of the paragraph (c) general 
license.
    Additional forms of evidence accepted with applications for 
specific licenses unblocking Cuban nationals permanently resident 
outside of Cuba. Former paragraph (b) of section 515.505 contained a 
statement of licensing policy pursuant to which OFAC would issue a 
specific license unblocking a Cuban national who had taken up permanent 
residence in a third country. Historically, OFAC required that a Cuban 
national obtain a permanent residence status recognized by the 
government of the relevant third country in documents issued by that 
government. Accordingly, former paragraph (b) required the submission 
of at least two documents from a list of qualifying documents issued by 
that third-country government showing permanent resident status.
    In recent years, OFAC increasingly has had to address situations 
where Cuban nationals have permanently left Cuba, and in some cases 
have lived outside of Cuba for many years, but are unable to provide 
the type or quantity of evidence required by paragraph (b) of section 
515.505. In some of these cases, the relevant foreign government 
maintains a policy that allows the Cuban national to reside there 
permanently, but that government does not issue documentation 
officially recognizing the Cuban national as a ``permanent resident.'' 
In other cases, the Cuban national may have left Cuba too recently to 
establish permanent residence in a third country, but other evidence, 
such as the circumstances under which the Cuban national left Cuba, 
clearly demonstrates that s/he either does not intend to, or would not 
be welcome to, return to Cuba. To address the cases that may warrant 
the issuance of a license but where the applicant cannot meet the 
evidentiary burden required by former paragraph (b), OFAC is revising 
that paragraph to allow for increased consideration of, and favorable 
licensing actions based upon, other evidence.

Public Participation

    Because the amendments of the Regulations involve a foreign affairs 
function, Executive Order 12866 and the provisions of the 
Administrative Procedure Act (5 U.S.C. 553) requiring notice of 
proposed rulemaking, opportunity for public participation, and delay in 
effective date are inapplicable. Because no notice of proposed 
rulemaking is required for this rule, the Regulatory Flexibility Act (5 
U.S.C. 601-612) does not apply.

Paperwork Reduction Act

    The collections of information related to the Regulations are 
contained in 31 CFR part 501 (the ``Reporting, Procedures and Penalties 
Regulations''). Pursuant to the Paperwork Reduction Act of 1995 (44 
U.S.C. 3507), those collections of information have been approved by 
the Office of Management and Budget under control number 1505-0164. An 
agency may not conduct or sponsor, and a person is not required to 
respond to, a collection of information unless the collection of 
information displays a valid control number.

7. Amend Sec.  515.505 by italicizing the first sentence of paragraph 
(a) and by revising the section heading, paragraphs (b), (c), and 
(e)(2), and the notes to paragraphs (a) and (b) to read as follows:


Sec.  515.505  Certain Cuban nationals unblocked; transactions of 
certain other Cuban nationals lawfully present in the United States.

    (a) * * *

    Note to paragraph (a):  An individual unblocked pursuant to this 
paragraph does not become blocked again merely by leaving the United 
States. An individual unblocked national remains unblocked unless 
and until the individual thereafter becomes domiciled in or a 
permanent resident of Cuba, meets any of the criteria in Sec.  
515.302(a)(2) through (5), or is a ``specially designated national'' 
of Cuba, as that term is defined in Sec.  515.306 of this part.

    (b) Specific licenses unblocking certain individuals who have taken 
up permanent residence outside of Cuba. Individual nationals of Cuba 
who have taken up permanent residence outside of Cuba may apply to the 
Office of Foreign Assets Control to be specifically licensed as 
unblocked nationals. Applications for specific licenses under this 
paragraph should include copies of at least two documents issued by the 
government authorities of the new country of permanent residence, such 
as a passport, voter registration card, permanent resident alien card, 
or national identity card. In cases where two of such documents are not 
available, other information will be considered, such as evidence that 
the individual has been resident for the past two years without 
interruption in a single country outside of Cuba or evidence that the 
individual does not intend to, or would not be welcome to, return to 
Cuba.

    Note to paragraph (b): An individual unblocked pursuant to this 
paragraph remains unblocked unless and until the individual 
thereafter becomes domiciled in or a permanent resident of Cuba, 
meets any of the criteria in Sec.  515.302(a)(2) through (5), or is 
a ``specially designated national'' of Cuba, as that term is defined 
in Sec.  515.306 of this part.

    (c) General license authorizing certain transactions of individuals 
who are lawfully present in the United States in a non-visitor status. 
An individual national of Cuba who is lawfully present in the United 
States in a non-visitor status is authorized to engage in all 
transactions available to an unblocked national, as that term is 
defined in Sec.  515.307 of this part, except that all property in 
which the individual has an interest that was blocked pursuant to this 
part prior to the date on which the individual became lawfully present 
in the United States in a non-visitor status shall remain blocked. Such 
an individual is further authorized to withdraw a total amount not to 
exceed $250 in any one calendar month from any blocked accounts held in 
the individual's name. For the purposes of this section, the term 
``non-visitor status'' does not apply to an individual who is present 
in the United States on a non-immigrant visa valid only for a specified 
period of time.

    (e) * * *
    (2) Example 2: A national of Cuba with a blocked U.S. bank account 
arrives in the United States without a valid visa but is allowed by the 
U.S. Government to remain in the United States in a non-visitor status. 
One year later, he applies for and receives permanent resident alien 
status. From the date he was permitted to remain in the United States 
in a non-visitor status until the date he applies for permanent 
resident alien status, he qualifies for the general license contained 
in paragraph (c) of this section. During this time he can engage in all 
transactions as if he is an unblocked national, with the exception that 
he cannot gain access to his blocked bank account other than to 
withdraw $250 each month. Beginning at the point in time when he 
applies for permanent resident alien status, he is licensed as an 
unblocked national pursuant to paragraph (a) of this section. At this 
time, he can apply to OFAC for a specific license to have his blocked 
bank account unblocked.
