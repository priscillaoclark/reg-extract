SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION: 
    Title: Process for Review of Swaps for Mandatory Clearing (OMB 
Control No. 3038-0097). This is a request for extension of a currently 
approved information collection.
    Abstract: The Commodity Exchange Act and Commission regulations 
require a derivatives clearing organization (DCO) that wishes to accept 
a swap for clearing to be eligible to clear the swap and to submit the 
swap to the Commission for a determination as to whether the swap is 
required to be cleared. Commission Regulation 39.5 sets forth the 
process for these submissions. The Commission will use the information 
in this collection to determine whether a DCO that wishes to accept a 
swap for clearing is eligible to clear the swap and whether the swap 
should be required to be cleared. An agency may not conduct or sponsor, 
and a person is not required to respond to, a collection of information 
unless it displays a currently valid OMB control number. On June 28, 
2023, the Commission published in the Federal Register notice of the 
proposed extension of this information collection and provided 60 days 
for public comment on the proposed extension, 88 FR 41932 (``60-Day 
Notice''). The Commission did not receive any relevant comments that 
addressed its PRA burden estimates.
    Burden Statement: The respondent burden for this collection is 
estimated to be as follows:
    Estimated Number of Respondents: 15.
    Estimated Average Burden Hours per Respondent: 40.
    Estimated Total Annual Burden Hours: 600.
    Frequency of Collection: On occasion. A DCO is only required to 
make a one-time submission before it first accepts a swap for clearing.
    There are no capital costs or operating and maintenance costs 
associated with this collection.

(Authority: 44 U.S.C. 3501 et seq.)

    Dated: September 21, 2023.
Robert Sidman,
Deputy Secretary of the Commission.
