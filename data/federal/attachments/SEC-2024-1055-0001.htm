[[Page 64498]]

pursuant to Section 17(d) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 
(``Act''),\1\ approving and declaring effective an amendment to the 
plan for allocating regulatory responsibility (``Plan'') filed on July 
31, 2024, pursuant to Rule 17d-2 of the Act,\2\ by NYSE American LLC 
(``NYSE American''), Cboe BZX Exchange, Inc., (``BZX''), the Cboe EDGX 
Exchange, Inc. (``EDGX''), Cboe C2 Exchange, Inc. (``C2''), Cboe 
Exchange, Inc. (``Cboe''), Nasdaq ISE, LLC (``ISE''), Financial

---------------------------------------------------------------------------

I. Introduction

    Section 19(g)(1) of the Act,\3\ among other things, requires every 
self-regulatory organization (``SRO'') registered as either a national 
securities exchange or national securities association to examine for, 
and enforce compliance by, its members and persons associated with its 
members with the Act, the rules and regulations thereunder, and the 
SRO's own rules, unless the SRO is relieved of this responsibility 
pursuant to Section 17(d) \4\ or Section 19(g)(2) \5\ of the Act. 
Without this relief, the statutory obligation of each individual SRO 
could result in a pattern of multiple examinations of broker-dealers 
that maintain memberships in more than one SRO (``common members''). 
Such regulatory duplication would add unnecessary expenses for common 
members and their SROs.
---------------------------------------------------------------------------

    \4\ 15 U.S.C. 78q(d).
    \5\ 15 U.S.C. 78s(g)(2).
---------------------------------------------------------------------------

    Section 17(d)(1) of the Act \6\ was intended, in part, to eliminate 
unnecessary multiple examinations and regulatory duplication.\7\ With 
respect to a common member, Section 17(d)(1) authorizes the Commission, 
by rule or order, to relieve an SRO of the responsibility to receive 
regulatory reports, to examine for and enforce compliance with 
applicable statutes, rules, and regulations, or to perform other 
specified regulatory functions.
---------------------------------------------------------------------------

    \6\ 15 U.S.C. 78q(d)(1).
    \7\ See Securities Act Amendments of 1975, Report of the Senate 
Committee on Banking, Housing, and Urban Affairs to Accompany S. 
249, S. Rep. No. 94-75, 94th Cong., 1st Session 32 (1975).
---------------------------------------------------------------------------

    To implement Section 17(d)(1), the Commission adopted two rules: 
Rule 17d-1 and Rule 17d-2 under the Act.\8\ Rule 17d-1 authorizes the 
Commission to name a single SRO as the designated examining authority 
(``DEA'') to examine common members for compliance with the financial 
responsibility requirements imposed by the Act, or by Commission or SRO 
rules.\9\ When an SRO has been named as a common member's DEA, all 
other SROs to which the common member belongs are relieved of the 
responsibility to examine the firm for compliance with the applicable 
financial responsibility rules. On its face, Rule 17d-1 deals only with 
an SRO's obligations to enforce member compliance with financial 
responsibility requirements. Rule 17d-1 does not relieve an SRO from 
its obligation to examine a common member for compliance with its own 
rules and provisions of the federal securities laws governing matters 
other than financial responsibility, including sales practices and 
trading activities and practices.

1976), 41 FR 18808 (May 7, 1976).
---------------------------------------------------------------------------

    To address regulatory duplication in these and other areas, the 
Commission adopted Rule 17d-2 under the Act.\10\ Rule 17d-2 permits 
SROs to propose joint plans for the allocation of regulatory 
responsibilities with respect to their common members. Under paragraph 
(c) of Rule 17d-2, the Commission may declare such a plan effective if, 
after providing for notice and comment, it determines that the plan is 
necessary or appropriate in the public interest and for the protection 
of investors, to foster cooperation and coordination among the SROs, to 
remove impediments to, and foster the development of, a national market 
system and a national clearance and settlement system, and is in 
conformity with the factors set forth in Section 17(d) of the Act. 
Commission approval of a plan filed pursuant to Rule 17d-2 relieves an 
SRO of those regulatory responsibilities allocated by the plan to 
another SRO.

II. The Plan

    On December 11, 2007, the Commission declared effective the 
Participating Organizations' Plan for allocating regulatory 
responsibilities pursuant to Rule 17d-2.\11\ On April 11, 2008, the 
Commission approved an amendment to the Plan to include NASDAQ as a 
participant.\12\ On October 9, 2008, the Commission approved an 
amendment to the Plan to clarify that the term Regulatory 
Responsibility for options position limits includes the examination 
responsibilities for the delta hedging exemption.\13\ On February 25, 
2010, the Commission approved an amendment to the Plan to add Bats and 
C2 as SRO participants and to reflect the name changes of the American 
Stock Exchange LLC to the NYSE Amex LLC, and the Boston Stock Exchange, 
Inc. to the NASDAQ OMX BX, Inc.\14\ On May 11, 2012, the Commission 
approved an amendment to the Plan to add BOX as a participant to the 
Plan.\15\ On December 5, 2012, the Commission approved an amendment to 
the Plan to add MIAX as a participant to the Plan.\16\ On July 26, 
2013, the Commission approved an amendment to the Plan to add Topaz 
Exchange, LLC as a Participant to the Plan.\17\ On October 29, 2015, 
the Commission approved an amendment to add EDGX as a Participant to 
the Plan and to change the name of Topaz Exchange, LLC to ISE Gemini, 
LLC.\18\ On February 16, 2016, the Commission approved an amendment to 
add ISE Mercury, LLC as a Participant to the Plan.\19\ On February 2, 
2017, the Commission approved an amendment to add MIAX PEARL as a 
Participant to the Plan.\20\ On February 11, 2019, the Commission 
approved an amendment to add MIAX Emerald as a Participant to

[[Page 64499]]

the Plan.\21\ On November 23, 2022, the Commission approved a proposed 
amendment to the Plan to add MEMX as a Participant to the Plan, to 
reflect name changes of certain Participating Organizations, and update 
rule references.\22\

---------------------------------------------------------------------------

    The Plan is designed to reduce regulatory duplication for common 
members by allocating regulatory responsibility for certain options-
related market surveillance matters among the Participating 
Organizations. Generally, under the Plan, a Participating Organization 
will serve as the Designated Options Surveillance Regulator (``DOSR'') 
for each common member assigned to it and will assume regulatory 
responsibility with respect to that common member's compliance with 
applicable common rules for certain accounts. When an SRO has been 
named as a common member's DOSR, all other SROs to which the common 
member belongs will be relieved of regulatory responsibility for that 
common member, pursuant to the terms of the Plan, with respect to the 
applicable common rules specified in Exhibit A to the Plan.

III. Proposed Amendment to the Plan

    On July 31, 2024, the parties submitted a proposed amendment to the 
Plan. The primary purpose of the amendment is to add MIAX Sapphire as a 
Participant to the Plan. The text of the proposed amended 17d-2 plan is

2017, the 8th day of January 2019, [and] the 18th[th] day of October 
2022, and the 19th day of July 2024, pursuant to Section 17(d) of the 
Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended (the ``Exchange Act''), and 
Rule 17d-2 thereunder (``Rule 17d-2''), which allows for a joint plan 
among self-regulatory organizations (``SROs'') to allocate regulatory 
obligations with respect to brokers or dealers that are members of two 
or more of the parties to this Agreement (``Common Members''). NYSE 
American, BZX, C2, Cboe, EDGX, Gemini, ISE, Mercury, FINRA, Arca, 
Nasdaq, BOX, BX, PHLX, MIAX, MIAX PEARL, MIAX Emerald, MIAX Sapphire, 
and MEMX, are collectively referred to herein as the ``Participants'' 
and individually, each a ``Participant.'' This Agreement shall be 
administered by a committee known as the Options Surveillance Group 
(the ``OSG'' or ``Group''), as described in Section V hereof. Unless 
defined in this Agreement or the context otherwise requires, the terms 
used herein shall have the meanings assigned thereto by the Exchange 
Act and the rules and regulations thereunder.
    Whereas, the Participants desire to eliminate regulatory 
duplication with respect to SRO market surveillance of Common Member 
\1\ activities with regard to certain common rules relating to listed 
options (``Options''); and
---------------------------------------------------------------------------

    \1\ In the case of the BX and BOX, members are those persons who 
are Options Participants (as defined in the BOX Exchange LLC Rules 
and NASDAQ BX, Inc. Rules).
---------------------------------------------------------------------------

    Whereas, for this purpose, the Participants desire to execute and 
file this Agreement with the Securities and Exchange Commission (the 
``SEC'' or ``Commission'') pursuant to Rule 17d-2.
    Now, therefore, in consideration of the mutual covenants contained 
in this Agreement, the Participants agree as follows:
    I. Except as otherwise provided in this Agreement, each Participant 
shall assume Regulatory Responsibility (as defined below) for the 
Common Members that are allocated or assigned to such Participant in 
accordance with the terms of this Agreement and shall be relieved of 
its Regulatory Responsibility as to the remaining Common Members. For 
purposes of this Agreement, a Participant shall be considered to be the 
Designated Options Surveillance Regulator (``DOSR'') for each Common 
Member that is allocated to it in accordance with Section VII.
    II. As used in this Agreement, the term ``Regulatory 
Responsibility'' shall mean surveillance, investigation and enforcement 
responsibilities relating to compliance by the Common Members with such 
Options rules of the Participants as the Participants shall determine 
are substantially similar and shall approve from time to time, insofar 
as such rules relate to market surveillance (collectively, the ``Common 
Rules''). For the purposes of this Agreement the list of Common Rules 
is attached as Exhibit A hereto, which may only be amended upon 
unanimous written agreement by the Participants. The DOSR assigned to 
each Common Member shall assume Regulatory Responsibility with regard 
to that Common Member's compliance with the applicable Common Rules for 
certain accounts.\2\ A DOSR may perform its Regulatory Responsibility 
or enter an agreement to transfer or assign such responsibilities to a 
national securities exchange registered with the SEC under Section 6(a) 
of the Exchange Act or a national securities association registered 
with the SEC under Section 15A of the Exchange Act. A DOSR may not 
transfer or assign its Regulatory Responsibility to an association 
registered for the limited purpose of regulating the activities of 
members who are registered as brokers or dealers in security futures 
products.
---------------------------------------------------------------------------

    \2\ Certain accounts shall include customer (``C'' as classified 
by the Options Clearing Corporation (``OCC'')) and firm (``F'' as 
classified by OCC) accounts, as well as other accounts, such as 
market maker accounts as the Participants shall, from time to time, 
identify as appropriate to review.
---------------------------------------------------------------------------

    The term ``Regulatory Responsibility'' does not include, and each 
Participant shall retain full responsibility with respect to:

[[Page 64500]]

    (a) surveillance, investigative and enforcement responsibilities 
other than those included in the definition of Regulatory 
Responsibility;
    (b) any aspects of the rules of a Participant that are not 
substantially similar to the Common Rules or that are allocated for a 
separate surveillance purpose under any other agreement made pursuant 
to Rule 17d-2. Any such aspects of a Common Rule will be noted as 
excluded on Exhibit A.
    With respect to options position limits, the term Regulatory 
Responsibility shall include examination responsibilities for the delta 
hedging exemption. Specifically, the Participants intend that FINRA 
will conduct examinations for delta hedging for all Common Members that 
are members of FINRA notwithstanding the fact that FINRA's position 
limit rule is, in some cases, limited to only firms that are not 
members of an options exchange (i.e., access members). In such cases, 
FINRA's examinations for delta hedging options position limit 
violations will be for the identical or substantively similar position 
limit rule(s) of the other Participant(s). Examinations for delta 
hedging for Common Members that are non-FINRA members will be conducted 
by the same Participant conducting position limit surveillance. The 
allocation of Common Members to DOSRs for surveillance of compliance 
with options position limits and other agreed to Common Rules is 
provided in Exhibit B. The allocation of Common Members to DOSRs for 
examinations of the delta hedging exemption under the options position 
limits rules is provided in Exhibit C.
    III. Each year within 30 days of the anniversary date of the 
commencement of operation of this Agreement, or more frequently if 
required by changes in the rules of a Participant, each Participant 
shall submit to the other Participants, through the Chair of the OSG, 
an updated list of Common Rules for review. This updated list may add 
Common Rules to Exhibit A, shall delete from Exhibit A rules of that 
Participant that are no longer identical or substantially similar to 
the Common Rules, and shall confirm that the remaining rules of the 
Participant included on Exhibit A continue to be identically or 
substantially similar to the Common Rules. Within 30 days from the date 
that each Participant has received revisions to Exhibit A from the 
Chair of the OSG, each Participant shall confirm in writing to the 
Chair of the OSG whether that Participant's rules listed in Exhibit A 
are Common Rules.
    IV. Apparent violation of another Participant's rules discovered by 
a DOSR, but which rules are not within the scope of the discovering 
DOSR's Regulatory Responsibility, shall be referred to the relevant 
Participant for such action as is deemed appropriate by that 
Participant.
    Notwithstanding the foregoing, nothing contained herein shall 
preclude a DOSR in its discretion from requesting that another 
Participant conduct an investigative or enforcement proceeding 
(``Proceeding'') on a matter for which the requesting DOSR has 
Regulatory Responsibility. If such other Participant agrees, the 
Regulatory Responsibility in such case shall be deemed transferred to 
the accepting Participant and confirmed in writing by the Participants 
involved. Additionally, nothing in this Agreement shall prevent another 
Participant on whose market potential violative activity took place 
from conducting its own Proceeding on a matter. The Participant 
conducting the Proceeding shall advise the assigned DOSR. Each 
Participant agrees, upon request, to make available promptly all 
relevant files, records and/or witnesses necessary to assist another 
Participant in a Proceeding.
    V. The OSG shall be composed of one representative designated by 
each of the Participants (a ``Representative''). Each Participant shall 
also designate one or more persons as its alternate representative(s) 
(an ``Alternate Representative''). In the absence of the 
Representative, the Alternate Representative shall assume the powers, 
duties and responsibilities of the Representative. Each Participant may 
at any time replace its Representative and/or its Alternate 
Representative to the Group.\3\ A majority of the OSG shall constitute 
a quorum and, unless otherwise required, the affirmative vote of a 
majority of the Representatives present (in person, by telephone or by 
written consent) shall be necessary to constitute action by the Group.
---------------------------------------------------------------------------

    \3\ A Participant must give notice to the Chair of the Group of 
such a change.
---------------------------------------------------------------------------

    The Group will have a Chair, Vice Chair and Secretary. A different 
Participant will assume each position on a rotating basis for a one-
year term. In the event that a Participant replaces a Representative 
who is acting as Chair, Vice Chair or Secretary, the newly appointed 
Representative shall assume the position of Chair, Vice Chair, or 
Secretary (as applicable) vacated by the Participant's former 
Representative. In the event a Participant cannot fulfill its duties as 
Chair, the Participant serving as Vice Chair shall substitute for the 
Chair and complete the subject unfulfilled term. All notices and other 
communications for the OSG are to be sent in care of the Chair and, as 
appropriate, to each Representative.
    VI. The OSG shall determine the times and locations of Group 
meetings, provided that the Chair, acting alone, may also call a 
meeting of the Group in the event the Chair determines that there is 
good cause to do so. To the extent reasonably possible, notice of any 
meeting shall be given at least ten business days prior to the meeting 
date. Representatives shall always be given the option of participating 
in any meeting telephonically at their own expense rather than in 
person.
    VII. No less frequently than every two years, in such manner as the 
Group deems appropriate, the OSG shall allocate Common Members that 
conduct an Options business among the Participants (``Allocation''), 
and the Participant to which a Common Member is allocated will serve as 
the DOSR for that Common Member. Any Allocation shall be based on the 
following principles, except to the extent all affected Participants 
consent to one or more different principles:
    (a) The OSG may not allocate a Common Member to a Participant 
unless the Common Member is a member of that Participant.
    (b) To the extent practicable, Common Members that conduct an 
Options business shall be allocated among the Participants of which 
they are members in such manner as to equalize as nearly as possible 
the allocation among such Participants, provided that no Common Members 
shall be allocated to FINRA. For example, if sixteen Common Members 
that conduct an Options business are members only of three 
Participants, none of which is FINRA, those Common Members shall be 
allocated among the three Participants such that no Participant is 
allocated more than six such members and no Participant is allocated 
less than five such members. If, in the previous example, one of the 
three Participants is FINRA, the sixteen Common Members would be 
allocated evenly between the remaining Participants, so that the two 
non-FINRA Participants would be allocated eight Common Members each.
    (c) To the extent practicable, Allocation shall take into account 
the amount of Options activity conducted by each Common Member in order 
to most evenly divide the Common Members with the largest amount of 
activity among the Participants of which they are members. Allocation 
will also take into account similar allocations pursuant to other plans 
or agreements to which the Common Members are party

[[Page 64501]]

to maintain consistency in oversight of the Common Members.\4\
---------------------------------------------------------------------------

    \4\ For example, if one Participant was allocated a Common 
Member by another regulatory group that Participant would be 
assigned to be the DOSR of that Common Member, unless there is good 
cause not to make that assignment.
---------------------------------------------------------------------------

    (d) To the extent practicable, Allocation of Common Members to 
Participants will be rotated among the applicable Participants such 
that a Common Member shall not be allocated to a Participant to which 
that Common Member was allocated within the previous two years. The 
assignment of DOSRs pursuant to the Allocation is attached as Exhibit B 
hereto, and will be updated from time to time to reflect Common Member 
Allocation changes.
    (e) The Group may reallocate Common Members from time-to-time, as 
it deems appropriate.
    (f) Whenever a Common Member ceases to be a member of its DOSR, the 
DOSR shall promptly inform the Group, which shall review the matter and 
allocate the Common Member to another Participant.
    (g) A DOSR may request that a Common Member to which it is assigned 
be reallocated to another Participant by giving 30 days written notice 
to the Chair of the OSG. The Group, in its discretion, may approve such 
request and reallocate the Common Member to another Participant.
    (h) All determinations by the Group with respect to Allocation 
shall be made by the affirmative vote of a majority of the Participants 
that, at the time of such determination, share the applicable Common 
Member being allocated; a Participant shall not be entitled to vote on 
any Allocation relating to a Common Member unless the Common Member is 
a member of such Participant.
    VIII. Each DOSR shall conduct routine surveillance reviews to 
detect violations of the applicable Common Rules by each Common Member 
allocated to it with a frequency (daily, weekly, monthly, quarterly, 
semi-annually or annually as noted on Exhibit A) not less than that 
determined by the Group. The other Participants agree that, upon 
request, relevant information in their respective files relative to a 
Common Member will be made available to the applicable DOSR. In 
addition, each Participant shall provide, to the extent not otherwise 
already provided, information pertaining to its surveillance program 
that would be relevant to FINRA or the Participant(s) conducting 
routine examinations for the delta hedging exemption.
    At each meeting of the OSG, each Participant shall be prepared to 
report on the status of its surveillance program for the previous 
quarter and any period prior thereto that has not previously been 
reported to the Group. In the event a DOSR believes it will not be able 
to complete its Regulatory Responsibility for its allocated Common 
Members, it will so advise the Group in writing promptly. The Group 
will undertake to remedy this situation by reallocating the subject 
Common Members among the remaining Participants. In such instance, the 
Group may determine to impose a regulatory fee for services provided to 
the DOSR that was unable to fulfill its Regulatory Responsibility.
    IX. Each Participant will, upon request, promptly furnish a copy of 
the report or applicable portions thereof relating to any investigation 
made pursuant to the provisions of this Agreement to each other 
Participant of which the Common Member under investigation is a member.
    X. Each Participant will routinely populate a common database, to 
be accessed by the Group relating to any formal regulatory action taken 
during the course of a Proceeding with respect to the Common Rules 
concerning a Common Member.
    XI. Any written notice required or permitted to be given under this 
Agreement shall be deemed given if sent by certified mail, return 
receipt requested, to any Participant to the attention of that

compensate the other(s) for costs incurred.
    XIII. The Participants shall notify the Common Members of this

Agreement to the same effect as though it had originally signed this

V. Discussion

    The Commission finds that the proposed Amended Plan is consistent 
with the factors set forth in Section 17(d) of the Act \22\ and Rule 
17d-2(c) thereunder \23\ in that the proposed Amended Plan is necessary 
or appropriate in the public interest and for the protection of 
investors, fosters cooperation and coordination among SROs, and removes 
impediments to and fosters the development of the national market 
system. The Commission continues to believe that the Plan, as proposed 
to be amended, is an achievement in cooperation among the SRO 
participants. The Plan, as amended, will reduce unnecessary regulatory 
duplication by allocating to the designated SRO the responsibility for 
certain options-related market surveillance matters that would 
otherwise be performed by multiple SROs. The Plan promotes efficiency 
by reducing costs to firms that are members of more than one of the SRO 
participants. In addition, because the SRO participants coordinate 
their regulatory functions in accordance with the Plan, the Plan 
promotes, and will continue to promote, investor protection. Under 
paragraph (c) of Rule 17d-2, the Commission may, after appropriate 
notice and comment, declare a plan, or any part of a plan, effective. 
In this instance, the Commission believes that appropriate notice and 
comment can take place after the proposed amendment is effective. The 
primary purpose of the amendment is to add MIAX Sapphire as a 
Participant. By declaring it effective today, the amended Plan can 
become effective and be implemented without undue delay. In addition, 
the Commission notes that the prior version of this Plan was published 
for comment, and the Commission did not receive any comments 
thereon.\24\ Finally, the Commission does not believe that the 
amendment to the Plan raises any new regulatory issues that the 
Commission has not previously considered.

VI. Conclusion

    This order gives effect to the amended Plan submitted to the 
Commission that is contained in File No. 4-551.
    It is further ordered that those SRO participants that are not the 
DOSR as to a particular common member are relieved of those regulatory 
responsibilities allocated to the common member's DOSR under the 
amended Plan to the extent of such allocation.

    For the Commission, by the Division of Trading and Markets, 
pursuant to delegated authority.\25\
