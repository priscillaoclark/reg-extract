SECURITIES AND EXCHANGE COMMISSION

[SEC File No. 270-574, OMB Control No. 3235-0648]


Submission for OMB Review; Comment Request; Extension: Rule 498

Upon Written Request, Copies Available From: Securities and Exchange 
Commission, Office of FOIA Services, 100 F Street NE, Washington, DC 
20549-2736

    Notice is hereby given that, pursuant to the Paperwork Reduction 
Act of 1995 (44 U.S.C. 3501 et seq.) (``Paperwork Reduction Act''), the 
Securities and Exchange Commission (``the Commission'') has submitted 
to the Office of Management and Budget (``OMB'') a request for 
extension of the previously approved collection of information 
discussed below.
    Rule 498 (17 CFR 230.498) under the Securities Act of 1933 (15 
U.S.C. 77a et seq.) (``Securities Act'') permits open-end management 
investment companies (``funds'') to satisfy their prospectus delivery 
obligations under the Securities Act by sending or giving key 
information directly to investors in the form of a summary prospectus 
(``Summary Prospectus'') and providing the statutory prospectus on a 
website. Upon an investor's request, funds are also required to send 
the statutory prospectus to the investor. In addition, under rule 498, 
a fund that relies on the rule to meet its statutory prospectus 
delivery obligations must make available, free of charge, the fund's 
current Summary Prospectus, statutory prospectus, statement of 
additional information, and most recent annual and semi-annual reports 
to shareholders at the website address specified in the required 
Summary Prospectus legend (17 CFR 270.498(e)(1)). A Summary Prospectus 
that complies with rule 498 is deemed to be a prospectus that is 
authorized under Section 10(b) of the Securities Act and Section 24(g) 
of the Investment Company Act of 1940 (15 U.S.C. 80a-1 et seq.).
    The purpose of rule 498 is to enable a fund to provide investors 
with a Summary Prospectus containing key information necessary to 
evaluate an investment in the fund. Unlike many other federal 
information collections, which are primarily for the use and benefit of 
the collecting agency, this information collection is primarily for the 
use and benefit of investors. The information filed with the Commission 
also permits the verification of compliance with securities law 
requirements and assures the public availability and dissemination of 
the information.
    Based on an analysis of fund filings, the Commission estimates that 
approximately 11,241 funds are using a Summary Prospectus. The 
Commission estimates that the annual hourly burden per fund associated 
with the compilation of the information required on the cover page or 
the beginning of the Summary Prospectus is 0.5 hours, and estimates 
that the annual hourly burden per fund to comply with the website 
posting requirement is approximately 1 hour, requiring a total of 1.5 
hours per fund per year.\1\ Thus the total annual hour burden 
associated with these requirements of the rule is approximately 
16,862.\2\ The Commission estimates that the annual cost burden is 
approximately $21,400 per fund, for a total annual cost burden of 
approximately $240,557,400.\3\
---------------------------------------------------------------------------

    \1\ 0.5 hours per fund + 1 hour per fund = 1.5 hours per fund.
    \2\ 1.5 hours per fund x 11,241 funds = 16,862 hours.
    \3\ $21,400 per fund x 11,241 funds = $240,557,400.
---------------------------------------------------------------------------

    Estimates of the average burden hours are made solely for the 
purposes of the Paperwork Reduction Act and are not derived from a 
comprehensive or even a representative survey or study of the costs of 
Commission rules and forms. Under rule 498, use of the Summary 
Prospectus is voluntary, but the rule's requirements regarding 
provision of the statutory prospectus upon investor request are 
mandatory for funds that elect to send or give a Summary Prospectus in 
reliance upon rule 498. The information provided under rule 498 will 
not be kept confidential. An agency may not conduct or sponsor, and a 
person is not required to respond to, a collection of information 
unless it displays a currently valid OMB control number.

collection at the following website: <a href="http://www.reginfo.gov">www.reginfo.gov</a>. Find this
