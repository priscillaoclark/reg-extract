[[Page 37248]]

please reference ``FHFA-31, Biographies.'' FHFA will make all comments 
timely received available for examination by the public through the 
electronic comment docket for this notice, which is located on the FHFA 
website at <a href="https://www.fhfa.gov">https://www.fhfa.gov</a>. All comments received will be posted

such as name, address (mailing and email), telephone numbers, and any

II. Introduction

    This notice informs the public of FHFA's proposal to establish and 
maintain a new system of records. This notice satisfies the Privacy Act 
requirement that an agency publishes a system of records notice in the 
Federal Register when establishing a new or making a significant change 
to an agency's system of records. Congress has recognized that 
application of all requirements of the Privacy Act to certain 
categories of records may have an undesirable and often unacceptable 
effect upon agencies in the conduct of necessary public business. 
Consequently, Congress established general exemptions and specific 
exemptions that could be used to exempt records from provisions of the 
Privacy Act. Congress also required that exempting records from 
provisions of the Privacy Act would require the head of an agency to 
publish a determination to exempt a record from the Privacy Act as a 
rule in accordance with the Administrative Procedure Act. Records and 
information in this system of records are not exempt from the 
requirements of the Privacy Act.
    As required by the Privacy Act, 5 U.S.C. 552a(r), and pursuant to 
section 7 of Office of Management and Budget (OMB) Circular No. A-108, 
``Federal Agency Responsibilities for Review, Reporting, and 
Publication under the Privacy Act,'' prior to publication of this 
notice, FHFA submitted a report describing the system of records 
covered by this notice to the OMB, the Committee on Oversight and 
Government Reform of the House of Representatives, and the Committee on 
Homeland Security and Governmental Affairs of the Senate.

therein may specifically be disclosed outside of FHFA as a routine use 
pursuant to 5 U.S.C. 552a(b)(3) as follows, to the extent such 
disclosures are compatible with the purposes for which the information 
was collected:
    (1) To appropriate agencies, entities, and persons when--(a) FHFA 
suspects or has confirmed that there has been a breach of the system of 
records; (b) FHFA has determined that as a result of a suspected or 
confirmed breach there is a risk of harm to individuals, FHFA 
(including its information systems, programs, and operations), the

to such agencies, entities, and persons as reasonably necessary to 
assist with FHFA's efforts to (i) respond to a suspected or confirmed 
breach or (ii) prevent, minimize, or remedy harm caused by such breach.
    (2) To a Federal agency or Federal entity, when FHFA determines 
information from this system of records is reasonably necessary to

or confirmed breach or; (b) preventing, minimizing, or remedying the 
risk of harm to individuals, the recipient agency or entity (including 
its information systems, programs, and operations), the Federal 
Government, or to national security, resulting from a suspected or 
confirmed breach.
    (3) When there is an indication of a violation or potential 
violation of law (whether civil, criminal, or regulatory in nature, and 
whether arising by general statute or particular program statute or by 
regulation, rule or order issued pursuant thereto), the relevant 
records in the system of records may be referred, as a routine use, to 
the appropriate agency (e.g., Federal, State, local, Tribal, foreign or 
a financial regulatory organization) charged with the responsibility of 
investigating or prosecuting such violation or charged with enforcing 
or implementing a statute, rule, regulation or order issued pursuant 
thereto.
    (4) To any individual during the course of any inquiry or 
investigation conducted by FHFA, or in connection with civil 
litigation, if FHFA has reason to believe the individual to whom the 
record is disclosed may have further information about the matters 
related thereto, and those matters appeared to be relevant and 
necessary at the time to the subject matter of the inquiry.
    (5) To any contractor, agent, or other authorized individual 
performing work on a contract, service, cooperative agreement, job, or 
other activity on behalf of FHFA who has a need to access the 
information in the

mediation or other dispute resolution procedures or programs.

litigation or has an interest in such litigation, and FHFA determines 
that the records are both relevant and necessary to the litigation.
    (8) To the National Archives and Records Administration or other 
Federal agencies pursuant to records management inspections being 
conducted under the authority of 44 U.S.C. 2904 and 2906.
