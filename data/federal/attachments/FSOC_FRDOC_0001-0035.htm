prudential standards and supervision by the Board of Governors of the 
Federal Reserve System under section 113 of the Dodd-Frank Wall Street 
Reform and Consumer Protection Act.

of the General Counsel, Treasury, at (202) 622-3773.

SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION:

I. Background

    Section 111 of the Dodd-Frank Wall Street Reform and Consumer 
Protection Act (the Dodd-Frank Act) established the Financial Stability 
Oversight Council (the Council).\1\ The statutory purposes of the 
Council are ``(A) to identify risks to the financial stability of the 
United States that could arise from the material financial distress or 
failure, or ongoing activities, of large, interconnected bank holding 
companies or nonbank financial companies, or that could arise outside 
the financial services marketplace; (B) to promote market discipline, 
by eliminating expectations on the part of shareholders, creditors, and 
counterparties of such companies that the Government will shield them 
from losses in the event of failure; and (C) to respond to emerging 
threats to the stability of the United States financial system.'' \2\
---------------------------------------------------------------------------

    \1\ Dodd-Frank Act section 111, 12 U.S.C. 5321.
    \2\ Dodd-Frank Act section 112(a)(1), 12 U.S.C. 5322(a)(1).
---------------------------------------------------------------------------

    The Council's duties under section 112 of the Dodd-Frank Act 
reflect the range of approaches the Council may consider to respond to 
potential threats to U.S. financial stability, which include collecting 
information from regulators, requesting data and analyses from the 
Office of Financial Research (OFR), monitoring the financial services 
marketplace and financial regulatory developments, facilitating 
information sharing and coordination among regulators, recommending to 
the Council member agencies general supervisory priorities and 
principles, identifying regulatory gaps, making recommendations to the 
Board of Governors of the Federal Reserve System (Federal Reserve) or 
other primary financial regulatory agencies,\3\ and designating certain 
entities or payment, clearing, and settlement activities for additional 
regulation.
---------------------------------------------------------------------------

    \3\ ``Primary financial regulatory agency'' is defined in 
section 2(12) of the Dodd-Frank Act, 12 U.S.C. 5301(12). Primary 
financial regulatory agencies and home country supervisors are 
referred to collectively as ``primary financial regulators'' in this 
preamble.
---------------------------------------------------------------------------

    Section 113 of the Dodd-Frank Act authorizes the Council to 
determine that a nonbank financial company will be subject to 
supervision by the Federal Reserve and prudential standards and lists 
the considerations that the Council must take into account in making 
such a determination. Designation \4\ is authorized if the Council 
determines that either (1) material financial distress at the nonbank 
financial company could pose a threat to U.S. financial stability 
(referred to as the ``first determination standard''), or (2) the 
nature, scope, size, scale, concentration, interconnectedness, or mix 
of the activities of the nonbank financial company could pose a threat 
to U.S. financial stability (the ``second determination standard'').\5\ 
Under section 165 of the Dodd-Frank Act, the Federal Reserve is 
responsible for establishing the prudential standards that will be 
applicable to a nonbank financial company subject to a Council 
designation under section 113 of the Dodd-Frank Act.
---------------------------------------------------------------------------

    \4\ Section 113 of the Dodd-Frank Act, 12 U.S.C. 5323, refers to 
a Council ``determination'' regarding a nonbank financial company. 
This preamble and the following interpretive guidance refer to 
``determination'' and ``designation'' interchangeably for ease of 
reading.
    \5\ For ease of reading, this preamble often refers to the first 
and second determination standards together as whether a company's 
``material financial distress or activities'' could pose a threat to 
financial stability.
---------------------------------------------------------------------------

    The Council has previously issued rules, guidance, and other public 
statements regarding its process for evaluating nonbank financial 
companies for potential designation. On April 11, 2012, the Council 
issued a final rule at 12 CFR 1310.1 through 23 (the 2012 Rule) setting 
forth certain procedures related to designations under section 113 of 
the Dodd-Frank Act. Attached to the 2012 Rule as Appendix A was 
interpretive guidance (the 2012 Interpretive Guidance) setting forth 
additional information regarding the manner in which the Council made 
determinations under section 113 (together with the 2012 Rule, the 2012 
Rule and Guidance). On February 4, 2015, the Council adopted 
supplemental procedures (the 2015 Supplemental Procedures) to the 2012 
Rule and Guidance.\6\ On March 13, 2019, the Council amended the 2012 
Rule by adding a new provision at 12 CFR 1310.3.\7\ On December 30, 
2019, the Council replaced the 2012 Interpretive Guidance with revised 
interpretive guidance (the 2019 Interpretive Guidance).\8\ In 
connection with the adoption of the 2019 Interpretive Guidance, the 
Council rescinded the 2015 Supplemental Procedures.\9\

on May 22, 2012, the Council approved hearing procedures relating to 
the conduct of hearings before the Council in connection with 
proposed determinations regarding nonbank financial companies and 
financial market utilities and related emergency waivers or 
modifications under sections 113 and 804 of the Dodd-Frank Act, 12 
U.S.C. 5323 and 5463; see 77 FR 31,855 (May 30, 2012). The hearing

guidance does not amend the Council's hearing procedures.
---------------------------------------------------------------------------

    On April 21, 2023, the Council approved proposed interpretive 
guidance (the Proposed Guidance) to revise and update the 2019 
Interpretive Guidance.\10\ The comment period was initially set to 
close after 60 days; however, in response to public requests for 
additional time to review and comment on the Proposed Guidance, the 
Council extended the comment period by 30 days.\11\ The comment period 
closed on July 27, 2023.

    The Council received 47 comment letters in response to the Proposed 
Guidance, of which 13 were from various advocacy groups, 11 were from 
companies or trade associations in the investment management industry, 
six were from trade associations in the

insurance industry, seven were from other companies or trade 
associations, five were from current or former state or federal 
government officials, two were from groups of academics, and three were 
from other individuals.\12\

---------------------------------------------------------------------------

    Having carefully considered the comments it received, at a public 
meeting on November 3, 2023, the Council adopted the final interpretive 
guidance below (the Final Guidance), which replaces in its entirety the 
2019 Interpretive Guidance, found at Appendix A to 12 CFR part 1310. 
The Council's rules at 12 CFR 1310.1 through 23 remain in effect.
    Also on November 3, 2023, the Council adopted a separate document 
explaining the Council's substantive approach to identifying, 
assessing, and responding to certain potential risks to U.S. financial 
stability (the Analytic Framework). The Analytic Framework describes 
the Council's analytic approach without regard to the origin of a 
particular risk, including whether the risk arises from widely 
conducted activities or from individual entities, and regardless of 
which of the Council's authorities may be used to address the risk. The 
Council approved a proposed version of the Analytic Framework (the 
Proposed Analytic Framework) on April 21, 2023.\13\ The public comment 
period for the Proposed Analytic Framework ran concurrently with the 
comment period for the Proposed Guidance, including the 30-day 
extension, and most of the comment letters noted above also addressed 
the Proposed Analytic Framework.

---------------------------------------------------------------------------

II. Overview of the Final Guidance

A. Overview

    With the Final Guidance, the Council aims to establish a durable 
process for the Council's use of its nonbank financial company 
designation authority, maintain rigorous procedural protections for 
nonbank financial companies reviewed for potential designation, and 
remove unwarranted hurdles to designation imposed by the 2019 
Interpretive Guidance. Congress created the designation authority based 
on lessons learned from the financial crisis in 2007-09, when financial 
distress at large, complex, highly interconnected, highly leveraged, 
and inadequately regulated nonbank financial companies devastated the 
financial system. While the financial system, market participants, and 
risks can rapidly evolve, it remains the Council's statutory 
responsibility not only to monitor the financial services marketplace 
but to take action to respond to emerging threats to U.S. financial 
stability.\14\
---------------------------------------------------------------------------

    \14\ See Dodd-Frank Act sections 112(a)(1)(C), (a)(2)(C), and 
(a)(2)(H), 12 U.S.C. 5322(a)(1)(C), (a)(2)(C), and (a)(2)(H).
---------------------------------------------------------------------------

    Under the Final Guidance, the Council's designation process is 
built on transparency and engagement with a company under review and 
its existing primary financial regulator (if any) during the 
designation process. Through this process, any Council designation of a 
nonbank financial company will be based on data-driven analysis that 
reflects the distinctive aspects of the company, its market, and its 
existing regulation. Further, the approach adopted in the Final 
Guidance does not make designation the Council's default method of 
addressing risks to financial stability--and the Final Guidance does 
not eliminate the Council's use of an activities-based approach to 
address risks to financial stability when the Council finds it to be 
appropriate. Instead, the Final Guidance puts the Council's designation 
authority on equal footing with its other powers. The Council expects 
to continue addressing most risks through its collaboration with 
primary financial regulators.

B. Key Changes From the 2019 Interpretive Guidance

    The Final Guidance removes three significant but inappropriate 
prerequisites to the exercise of the Council's nonbank financial 
company designation authority that were created by the 2019 
Interpretive Guidance. In particular, the 2019 Interpretive Guidance 
stated that before considering a nonbank financial company for 
potential designation under section 113 of the Dodd-Frank Act, the 
Council would exhaust all available alternatives by prioritizing an 
``activities-based approach,'' perform a cost-benefit analysis, and 
assess a company's likelihood of material financial distress. As 
explained below, the Council has determined that these steps are not 
legally required, are not useful or appropriate, and would unduly 
hamper the Council's ability to use the statutory designation authority 
in relevant circumstances:
    <bullet> By prioritizing other approaches to mitigating risks to 
financial stability, the 2019 Interpretive Guidance generally allowed 
the Council to consider a nonbank financial company for potential 
designation only after the Council completed a multi-step process in 
which the Council would wait for existing regulators to address 
identified risks to financial stability, obstructing the Council's 
ability to respond to risks to financial stability in a timely fashion.
    <bullet> Cost-benefit analysis is not in the list of considerations 
Congress specifically required the Council to consider in a 
designation, and due to the unpredictability of financial crises, such 
an analysis is not reasonably estimable, useful, or warranted in this 
context.
    <bullet> Assessing a nonbank financial company's likelihood of 
material financial distress is not among the tasks Congress set for the 
Council and could undermine financial stability by spurring a run on a 
company that is designated or under review for potential designation.
    Unlike the 2012 Interpretive Guidance and the 2019 Interpretive 
Guidance, the Final Guidance is focused on the Council's procedures for 
nonbank financial company designations. It therefore does not discuss 
the substantive analytic factors the Council applies in its assessments 
of nonbank financial companies. The Council has issued a separate 
document--the Analytic Framework--regarding its approach to 
identifying, assessing, and responding to potential risks to U.S. 
financial stability. The Analytic Framework provides additional public 
transparency into how the Council expects to consider any type of risk 
to financial stability, regardless of which of the Council's 
authorities may be used to address the risk.
    Similarly, the Final Guidance does not include the 2019 
Interpretive Guidance's definition of ``threat to the financial 
stability of the United States'' as requiring ``severe damage on the 
broader economy.'' \15\ The Council has determined that this definition 
was overly restrictive and in conflict with the Council's statutory 
purpose ``to respond to emerging threats to the stability of the United 
States financial system.'' \16\ Instead, as described in detail below, 
the Analytic Framework states that events or conditions that could 
substantially impair the financial system's ability to support economic 
activity would constitute a threat to financial stability.
---------------------------------------------------------------------------

    \15\ See 84 FR at 71,763 (Dec. 30, 2019). The definition of this 
term in the 2019 Interpretive Guidance imposed a higher threshold 
than the Council's previous interpretation of this term under the 
2012 Interpretive Guidance.
    \16\ Dodd-Frank Act section 112(a)(1)(C), 12 U.S.C. 
5322(a)(1)(C).
---------------------------------------------------------------------------

    With respect to the Council's procedures for nonbank financial 
company designations and annual reevaluations of designations, the 
Final

[[Page 80112]]

Guidance makes only minor changes to the 2019 Interpretive Guidance. 
Among other things, the Final Guidance continues to provide for 
significant engagement and communication between the Council and a 
nonbank financial company under review for potential designation, and 
with the company's primary financial regulator. In addition to these 
pre-existing features, the Final Guidance provides further detail on 
how the Council expects to identify nonbank financial companies for 
preliminary evaluation to assess the risks they could pose to U.S. 
financial stability. The Council believes that under these procedures, 
the designation process will be rigorous and transparent.\17\
---------------------------------------------------------------------------

    \17\ Because the Final Guidance itself appears in narrative form 
and makes only minor changes to the designation process described in 
the Council's existing guidance--separate from the modification of 
the substantive analytic content discussed below--this preamble does 
not include a complete and detailed description of the designation 
process, which appears in the Final Guidance itself. Instead, the 
following overview focuses on the Council's reasons for adopting the 
Final Guidance, key changes from the 2019 Interpretive Guidance and 
the Proposed Guidance, and responses to comments received on the 
Proposed Guidance.
---------------------------------------------------------------------------

C. Process for Nonbank Financial Company Determinations

    As described in the Final Guidance,\18\ the Council expects 
generally to follow a two-stage process in considering a nonbank 
financial company for potential designation under section 113 of the 
Dodd-Frank Act. This process is designed to enable substantial 
engagement with the company under consideration and its primary 
financial regulator,\19\ in recognition of the primary financial 
regulator's knowledge regarding the company and its market. The Final 
Guidance does not prioritize the designation authority above other 
approaches to mitigating risks to financial stability; instead, the 
Council's process explicitly contemplates that identified risks may be 
addressed through alternatives to designation, such as nonbinding 
recommendations to primary financial regulatory agencies. The Council 
does not expect that every company that comes under review will 
progress to a proposed or final designation, and it is the Council's 
goal that companies will have ample opportunities to provide relevant 
information to and engage with the Council as part of a transparent and 
durable designation process.
---------------------------------------------------------------------------

    \18\ This discussion provides an abbreviated summary of the 
procedural steps of the Council's nonbank financial company 
designation process. The Final Guidance itself sets forth the 
process the Council expects to follow and should be consulted with 
respect to the elements of that process.
    \19\ In each stage of the designation process, the Council may 
also consult with, request information from, or coordinate with 
other state or federal financial regulatory agencies that have 
jurisdiction over the nonbank financial company or its activities.
---------------------------------------------------------------------------

    The initial identification of companies that the Council may review 
in the first stage of the designation process (Stage 1) is a function 
of the Council's staff-level committees, which are responsible for 
monitoring and analyzing financial markets, financial companies, the 
financial system, and issues related to financial stability. These 
committees monitor the financial system and report to the Council's 
Deputies Committee \20\ regarding potential risks to U.S. financial 
stability that they identify. If an identified risk relates to one or 
more nonbank financial companies that may merit review, the Council may 
review those companies in Stage 1. Alternatively, the Deputies 
Committee may direct a staff-level committee or working group to 
further assess the identified risks or direct the Council's Nonbank 
Financial Companies Designations Committee \21\ to conduct an initial 
analysis of one or more companies based on the risk-assessment approach 
described in the Analytic Framework. Following any such analysis, the 
Council may review one or more companies in Stage 1.
---------------------------------------------------------------------------

    \20\ The Council's Deputies Committee is composed of senior 
officials from each Council member and member agency. See Bylaws of 
the Deputies Committee of the Financial Stability Oversight Council, 
available at <a href="https://fsoc.gov">https://fsoc.gov</a>.
    \21\ The Nonbank Financial Companies Designations Committee 
supports the Council in fulfilling the Council's responsibilities to 
consider, make, and review Council determinations regarding nonbank 
financial companies under section 113 of the Dodd-Frank Act. See 
Charter of the Nonbank Financial Companies Designations Committee of 
the Financial Stability Oversight Council, available at <a href="https://fsoc.gov">https://fsoc.gov</a>.
---------------------------------------------------------------------------

    Stage 1 involves a preliminary analysis of nonbank financial 
companies to assess the risks they could pose to U.S. financial 
stability. Review in this stage is based on quantitative and 
qualitative information available to the Council primarily through 
public and regulatory sources and includes consultation with the 
company's primary financial regulator (if any), as appropriate. Among 
other procedural safeguards, the Final Guidance states that the company 
is notified of its consideration in Stage 1 at least 60 days before the 
Council votes on whether to evaluate the company further in the second 
stage of review (Stage 2). This provides the company with an 
opportunity voluntarily to submit relevant information to the Council 
and to meet with staff who are leading the Council's analysis. A 
nonbank financial company that is identified for review in Stage 2 will 
receive an additional notice that it is being considered for a proposed 
designation. The Council wishes to underscore, as the Final Guidance 
notes, that its work in Stage 1 is preliminary. A decision to commence 
review of a company in Stage 1, or to continue a review in Stage 2, 
does not constitute a final decision regarding whether the company 
should be designated.
    Stage 2 involves an in-depth review of a nonbank financial company 
using information collected directly from the company through the OFR, 
as well as public and regulatory information. Stage 2 involves 
significant engagement with the company under review and its primary 
financial regulator. Following notice of a Council decision to evaluate 
the company in Stage 2, the Council will submit to the company a 
request that it provide information that the Council deems relevant to 
the Council's evaluation. The nonbank financial company will also be 
provided an opportunity to submit any other written information it 
deems relevant. The Council will make staff representing its members 
available to meet with the representatives of any company that enters 
Stage 2, to explain the evaluation process and the framework for the 
Council's analysis, and the Council expects that its Deputies Committee 
will also grant a request to meet with a company in Stage 2. Further, 
communication during Stage 2 will be two-way: For example, if the 
analysis in Stage 1 has identified specific aspects of the company's 
operations or activities as the primary focus for the Council's 
evaluation, staff will notify the company of those specific aspects, 
enabling the company to understand and provide information relevant to 
those concerns. The Council will also notify any nonbank financial 
company in Stage 2 if the company ceases to be considered for a 
determination.
    At the conclusion of Stage 2, the Council may consider whether to 
make a proposed determination with respect to the nonbank financial 
company (a Proposed Determination) through a process that emphasizes 
transparency through additional notice, engagement, and procedural 
safeguards. A Proposed Determination requires a vote of two-thirds of 
the voting members of the Council then serving, including an 
affirmative vote by the Chairperson of the Council, and cannot be 
delegated by the Council.\22\ Following a Proposed Determination, the 
Council will issue a written notice of the Proposed

[[Page 80113]]

Determination to the nonbank financial company, which will include an 
explanation of the basis of the Proposed Determination.\23\ Promptly 
after the Council votes to make a Proposed Determination regarding a 
company, the Council will also provide the company's primary financial 
regulator with the written explanation of the basis of the Council's 
Proposed Determination (subject to appropriate protections for 
confidential information). A nonbank financial company that is subject 
to a Proposed Determination may request a hearing to contest the 
Proposed Determination in accordance with section 113(e) of the Dodd-
Frank Act and applicable Council procedures.
---------------------------------------------------------------------------

    \22\ 12 CFR 1310.10(b).
    \23\ Dodd-Frank Act section 113(e)(1), 12 U.S.C. 5323(e)(1).
---------------------------------------------------------------------------

    After making a Proposed Determination and holding any written or 
oral hearing if requested, the Council may vote to make a final 
determination that the company will be subject to supervision by the 
Federal Reserve and prudential standards (a Final Determination). Like 
a Proposed Determination, a Final Determination requires a vote of two-
thirds of the voting members of the Council then serving, including an 
affirmative vote by the Chairperson of the Council, and cannot be 
delegated by the Council.\24\ If the Council makes a Final 
Determination, it will provide the company with a written notice of its 
Final Determination, including an explanation of the basis for the 
Council's decision.\25\ The Council will also provide the company's 
primary financial regulator with the written explanation of the basis 
of the Council's Final Determination (subject to appropriate 
protections for confidential information) and will publicly release the 
explanation of the Council's basis for the Final Determination.\26\

    \24\ 12 CFR 1310.10(b).
    \25\ Dodd-Frank Act section 113(e)(3), 12 U.S.C. 5323(e)(3); see 
also 12 CFR 1310.21 and 1310.22.
    \26\ The Council is subject to statutory and regulatory 
requirements to maintain the confidentiality of certain information 
submitted to it by a nonbank financial company or its regulators. 
See Dodd-Frank Act section 112(d)(5), 12 U.S.C. 5322(d)(5); see also 
12 CFR 1310.20(e). In light of these confidentiality obligations, 
such confidential information will be redacted from the materials 
that the Council makes publicly available, although the Council does 
not expect to restrict a company's ability to disclose such 
information.
---------------------------------------------------------------------------

    After the Council makes a Final Determination regarding a nonbank 
financial company, the Council intends to continue to encourage the 
company or its regulators to take steps to mitigate the potential risks 
identified in the Council's written explanation of the basis for its 
Final Determination. The Council is required to reevaluate each Final 
Determination at least annually and to rescind the designation if the 
Council determines that the company no longer meets the statutory 
standards for designation under section 113 of the Dodd-Frank Act.\27\ 
The annual reevaluation process is a key mechanism through which a 
company's designation may be rescinded if the company has mitigated the 
threat that its material financial distress or activities could pose to 
U.S. financial stability. Moreover, once every five years, each nonbank 
financial company subject to a Final Determination will have an 
opportunity for an oral hearing before the Council at which the company 
can contest the designation.
---------------------------------------------------------------------------

    \27\ Dodd-Frank Act section 113(d), 12 U.S.C. 5323(d).
---------------------------------------------------------------------------

    Numerous public comments on the Proposed Guidance supported the 
proposed approach of maintaining certain procedural steps that were set 
forth in the 2019 Interpretive Guidance, including the two-stage 
designation process, extensive engagement by the Council and staff with 
companies under review and their primary financial regulators, and the 
Council's annual reevaluations of previous designations. Some 
commenters stated that the two-stage process, including notice and 
opportunities for engagement between the Council and the company under 
review and its primary financial regulator, provides a balanced and 
transparent approach to designation. Others expressed support for 
specific aspects of the Proposed Guidance. For example, one commenter 
stated that the Council should retain the ability to consider companies 
and their subsidiaries either together or separately for designation 
because modern risk management emphasizes the importance of 
understanding and managing a firm's risks holistically, across the 
entire enterprise.
    Some commenters noted that the Proposed Guidance would increase 
public transparency regarding how companies are identified for review 
for a potential designation under section 113 of the Dodd-Frank Act. As 
discussed above, the Final Guidance provides additional detail, 
compared to the 2019 Interpretive Guidance, on how the Council expects 
to identify nonbank financial companies for preliminary review in Stage 
1.
    Other commenters suggested procedural changes to the designation 
process in the Proposed Guidance. For example, commenters suggested 
accelerating the designation process by combining Stage 1 and Stage 2 
or by removing the opportunity in Stage 1 for a company under review to 
submit information to the Council. At least one commenter suggested 
adding a step in the process to determine whether existing regulation 
is insufficient to mitigate relevant threats to financial stability. 
Other commenters suggested expanding the notice periods provided in the 
Proposed Guidance, including a longer notice period in advance of a 
vote to commence Stage 2 or a 120-day period for a company to review 
all information before the Council \28\ in advance of a Final 
Determination vote. The Council has declined to modify the stages or 
notice periods as proposed, which enable appropriate time periods for 
engaging with companies and their primary financial regulators while 
not unduly delaying the Council's ability to act to address a potential 
threat to U.S. financial stability. Further, the proposed two-stage 
process enables the Council gradually to intensify its review of a 
company, beginning with a review in Stage 1 based primarily on 
available information and potentially moving to in-depth engagement 
with the company and its primary financial regulator in Stage 2.
---------------------------------------------------------------------------

    \28\ Some commenters also advocated providing the ``full 
evidentiary record'' to the company under review before a Council 
vote on a Final Determination. The Council appreciates the 
importance of transparency and dialogue with a company under review 
and will provide a company under review with a written explanation 
of the basis of any Proposed Determination as well as the 
opportunity for a hearing, among other opportunities to engage with 
the Council and staff representing Council members and member 
agencies.
---------------------------------------------------------------------------

    Some commenters requested that the Council further explain how 
companies under consideration in Stage 1 or Stage 2 can take steps that 
would avoid a designation. Others recommended that the guidance include 
language, found in the 2019 Interpretive Guidance, that the information 
the Council provides to a company during Stage 1 ``may enable the 
company to act to mitigate any risks to financial stability and thereby 
potentially avoid becoming subject to a Council determination.'' \29\ 
The Council agrees that its engagement with a company under review may 
enable the company to act to mitigate the threat its material financial 
distress or activities could pose to financial stability. Further, if 
the company were to mitigate those risks before a Final Designation 
such that its material financial distress or activities could not pose 
a threat to financial stability, designation would not be warranted. 
Accordingly, the Council has added the language quoted above to the 
Final Guidance.

[[Page 80114]]

Nonetheless, while the Council expects to communicate to companies 
under review regarding potential risks to financial stability that have 
been identified, in light of the importance of acting promptly to 
mitigate potential threats to financial stability, the Council does not 
expect to advise companies on actions they may take, delay the 
designation process in connection with potential actions that a company 
considers taking, or refrain from a proposed or final designation based 
on actions that a company has proposed but not completed.
---------------------------------------------------------------------------

---------------------------------------------------------------------------

    With respect to the transparency measures embedded in the 
designation process under the Proposed Guidance, several commenters 
voiced support, including noting that the Council has continued the 
procedural transparency provided for in the 2019 Interpretive Guidance. 
For example, some commenters noted that the opportunities for 
engagement with the Council and submission of relevant information to 
it would facilitate transparency for companies under review. Other 
commenters specifically noted the importance of the Proposed Guidance's 
commitment to publicly release the written explanation of the Council's 
basis for a Final Determination.
    Several commenters raised other transparency-related suggestions. 
Some stated that more information regarding how the Council considers 
threats to financial stability could give companies additional insight 
and help mitigate risks and avoid designation. As noted above, the 
Final Guidance states that engagement with a company under review may 
enable the company to mitigate any risks to financial stability. The 
Council's Analytic Framework also provides additional transparency into 
how the Council considers risks to financial stability. The Council 
believes that the numerous transparency mechanisms in the Final 
Guidance, which provide opportunities for engagement with companies 
under review and their primary financial regulators in Stage 1, in 
Stage 2, after a Proposed Determination, and after a Final 
Determination, provide an appropriate level of transparency to 
companies regarding the Council's reviews. Some commenters also noted 
that the Federal Reserve's establishment of prudential standards and an 
applicable supervisory regime only after a company's designation leaves 
opaque the consequences of designation. However, the division of 
authority between the Council and the Federal Reserve is an element of 
the statutory structure Congress adopted, not the Council's designation 
procedures. In developing prudential standards applicable to designated 
nonbank financial companies, the Federal Reserve is required to 
differentiate among companies on an individual basis or by category, 
taking into consideration their capital structure, riskiness, 
complexity, financial activities, size, and any other risk-related 
factors that the Federal Reserve deems appropriate.\30\
---------------------------------------------------------------------------

    \30\ Dodd-Frank Act section 165(a)(2)(A), 12 U.S.C. 
5365(a)(2)(A).
---------------------------------------------------------------------------

    Several commenters suggested the Council further emphasize the 
importance of the Council's engagement with primary financial 
regulators. The Proposed Guidance noted the Council's expectation of 
engagement with the primary financial regulator of a company under 
review at every stage of the designation process, and the Final 
Guidance maintains that commitment. The Council extensively engages 
with federal and state financial regulatory agencies to identify, 
assess, and respond to risks to financial stability. Nearly all the 
Council members represent such agencies. Many of the Council's 
statutory duties relate to promoting interagency collaboration, 
monitoring financial market developments, facilitating information 
sharing, and recommending that existing regulators address risks.\31\ 
These activities comprise the foundation of the Council's work, and 
under the Final Guidance the Council will continue to work with 
regulators to identify, assess, and respond to risks to financial 
stability.
---------------------------------------------------------------------------

    \31\ See, e.g., Dodd-Frank Act sections 112(a)(2)(A), (C), (D), 
(E), (F), (I), and (K), 12 U.S.C. 5322(a)(2)(A), (C), (D), (E), (F), 
(I), and (K).
---------------------------------------------------------------------------

    Other commenters suggested that the Council should notify a 
company's primary financial regulator that the company is under 
consideration in Stage 1. The Proposed Guidance and Final Guidance 
provide that a company's primary financial regulator will receive 
notice that the company is under review no later than when the company 
receives notice, which occurs no later than 60 days before the Council 
votes on whether to evaluate the company in Stage 2. In some cases, the 
primary financial regulator may receive earlier notice, including if 
the Council has been engaging with the primary financial regulator in 
previous efforts, unrelated to a potential designation, to evaluate the 
potential threat to financial stability, or if the primary financial 
regulator is among the Council's member agencies. In general, however, 
the Council believes that receiving notice simultaneously with the 
company during Stage 1 will enable the primary financial regulator 
appropriately to engage with the Council.\32\
---------------------------------------------------------------------------

    \32\ The Proposed Guidance refers to the notice provided to 
companies in Stage 1 in both section II.a, which provides an 
overview of the determination process, and section II.b, which 
describes Stage 1 in detail. The Final Guidance clarifies these 
references by specifying that the description in section II.a refers 
to the notice provided in section II.b.
---------------------------------------------------------------------------

    Other commenters suggested that the Council should not only engage 
with a company's primary financial regulator during the designation 
process, but should defer to the primary financial regulator's views. 
The Council firmly supports close engagement with primary financial 
regulators, but deferring to those regulators during a review under 
section 113 of the Dodd-Frank Act would not fulfill the Council's duty 
to determine whether a company under review meets the statutory 
standard for designation. The Council values the role of primary 
financial regulators due to their expertise regarding their regulated 
entities or markets, but Congress charged the Council with making 
determinations regarding threats to U.S. financial stability. The 
Council will engage with primary financial regulators and take their 
views into account, but ultimately the Council itself is responsible 
for determining whether a nonbank financial company meets the statutory 
standard for designation.
    Some commenters called for additional clarity regarding the staff-
level process for identifying nonbank financial companies for 
preliminary evaluation, or recommended that the Council adopt uniform 
quantitative thresholds, such as those in the 2012 Interpretive 
Guidance, to identify companies for review in Stage 1. The Council 
believes that the process set forth in the Final Guidance under 
``Identification of Company for Review in Stage 1'' appropriately 
explains the Council's process. To the extent commenters seek 
information regarding the substantive analyses the Council and staff 
representing Council members expect to use in considering risks that 
relate to a company that may be considered in Stage 1, those analyses 
are described in the Analytic Framework. While quantitative thresholds 
such as those in the 2012 Interpretive Guidance \33\ provide some 
clarity regarding companies that are most likely to come under review 
for potential designation, even that previous guidance noted that firms 
not captured

[[Page 80115]]

by the thresholds could also be reviewed. Further, the Council believes 
that in light of the distinct nature of nonbank financial companies in 
diverse sectors of the financial system, uniform quantitative 
thresholds do not adequately align with the range of risks that nonbank 
financial companies' material financial distress or activities could 
pose. Because the activities of nonbank financial companies 
continuously evolve, uniform thresholds that are applicable across the 
financial sector may also become obsolete or less relevant to specific 
risks. The Council believes the approach described in the Final 
Guidance and the Analytic Framework will be more conducive to 
identifying firms for consideration for designation than uniform 
quantitative thresholds such as those that the Council applied in Stage 
1 under the 2012 Interpretive Guidance.
---------------------------------------------------------------------------

    \33\ Uniform quantitative thresholds were not included in the 
2019 Interpretive Guidance.
---------------------------------------------------------------------------

    A few commenters recommended that the guidance prohibit the Council 
from delegating its authority to commence a review of a company in 
Stage 1.\34\ Some commenters further contended that a Council vote on 
commencing Stage 1 is legally required by either the Dodd-Frank Act or 
the Administrative Procedure Act (APA). However, while the Dodd-Frank 
Act specifies that the Council may not delegate its vote to designate a 
company, it contains no such requirement regarding earlier steps in the 
process, such as commencing Stage 1. Indeed, the statute itself does 
not contemplate any procedural safeguards for companies under review 
prior to a Council vote on a Proposed Determination; Stage 1 and Stage 
2 are investigatory processes the Council has voluntarily adopted to 
enhance its analytic rigor and to promote transparency. The APA 
likewise contains no requirement related to the delegation of authority 
to commence Stage 1, which involves only the interlocutory decision to 
initiate an investigatory process and does not determine any rights or 
obligations of any person or entity or cause any legal consequences. 
The Final Guidance does not prohibit a delegation of the vote to 
commence Stage 1, but it also does not mandate such a delegation. 
Moreover, under the Final Guidance the Council itself will vote 
multiple times during the designation process, including voting on 
commencing Stage 2, a Proposed Designation, and a Final Designation, 
and potentially the determination that the administrative record in 
Stage 2 is complete.
---------------------------------------------------------------------------

    \34\ In accordance with the Council's Rules of Organization, the 
Council may delegate authority, including to its Deputies Committee, 
to implement and take any actions under the Final Guidance, except 
with respect to actions that are expressly nondelegable under the 
Dodd-Frank Act, the Council's Rules of Organization, or the Final 
Guidance.
---------------------------------------------------------------------------

D. Substantive Analyses

    The Council has issued a separate document--the Analytic 
Framework--that describes in detail the Council's approach for 
identifying, assessing, and responding to potential risks to financial 
stability. The Analytic Framework explains how the Council analyzes 
risks to financial stability, regardless of both the origin of a 
particular risk (including whether the risk arises from widely 
conducted activities or from individual entities) and which of the 
Council's authorities may be used to address the risk. The Council 
believes that the Analytic Framework provides new public transparency 
into how the Council expects to consider risks to financial stability. 
Among other things, the Analytic Framework interprets terms that 
broadly frame the Council's work, including ``financial stability'' and 
``threat to financial stability.'' Therefore, while the 2012 
Interpretive Guidance and the 2019 Interpretive Guidance discussed both 
nonbank financial company designation procedures and also substantive 
analytic factors and standards the Council applies in its assessment of 
nonbank financial companies, the Final Guidance is limited to the 
Council's procedures related to nonbank financial company 
designations.\35\ The substantive factors the Council considers in 
analyzing potential risks to financial stability are addressed in the 
Analytic Framework. The Council believes that publishing its procedures 
for nonbank financial company designations (the Final Guidance) 
separately from its explanation of how it substantively assesses 
potential financial stability risks (the Analytic Framework) enhances 
public transparency and provides clarity regarding the range of 
authorities the Council uses to respond to risks.\36\
---------------------------------------------------------------------------

    \35\ The Final Guidance retains the 2019 Interpretive Guidance's 
interpretations of ``company'' and ``material financial distress,'' 
key terms in section 113 of the Dodd-Frank Act that are left 
undefined in the statute. The Final Guidance also includes the 2019 
Interpretive Guidance's interpretation of ``nonbank financial 
company supervised by the Board of Governors,'' a term defined in 
the Dodd-Frank Act. The preamble to the Proposed Guidance noted the 
Council's proposal to retain its 2019 interpretation of this 
statutory term, and the Proposed Guidance contained language from 
the 2019 Interpretive Guidance regarding the practical implications 
of that interpretation. Consistent with the Proposed Guidance, the 
Final Guidance states that ``the Council intends to interpret 
`nonbank financial company supervised by the Board of Governors' as 
including any nonbank financial company that acquires, directly or 
indirectly, a majority of the assets or liabilities of a company 
that is subject to a final determination of the Council.''
    \36\ Comments on the Proposed Analytic Framework are addressed 
in the preamble to the Analytic Framework.
---------------------------------------------------------------------------

1. Analytic Factors
    The 2019 Interpretive Guidance described both the Council's 
procedures and analytic factors that the Council expected to apply in 
nonbank financial company designations. For example, that guidance 
described channels the Council deemed most likely to facilitate the 
transmission of the negative effects of a nonbank financial company's 
material financial distress or activities to other financial firms and 
markets. These descriptions do not appear in the Final Guidance and 
will not be included in Appendix A to 12 CFR part 1310. Instead, a 
description of the analyses the Council expects to apply, both within 
and outside of the designation context, appears in its separately 
issued Analytic Framework.
    Some commenters supported separating the Council's guidance on the 
nonbank financial company designation process from the discussion of 
the substantive analyses it uses to consider risks to financial 
stability, citing, among other things, the procedural nature of the 
Proposed Guidance (and by extension, the Final Guidance) and the 
benefits of establishing a unified framework for considering risks 
without regard to their origin. Additional commenters noted that 
adopting a broadly applicable Analytic Framework will help the Council 
and regulators take a consistent approach, regardless of the origin of 
a particular risk, and will provide transparency that may help nonbank 
financial companies identify and mitigate risks that might otherwise 
lead the firms to be considered for potential designation under the 
Final Guidance.
    Other commenters argued that the Final Guidance should retain a 
description of the Council's analysis specifically applicable to 
nonbank financial company designations.\37\ As explained above, the 
Council believes that issuing separate documents regarding the 
procedural aspects of the nonbank financial company designation process 
and the Council's substantive

[[Page 80116]]

analysis of risks to financial stability is the better approach. 
History illustrates that many factors, such as leverage, liquidity 
risk, and operational risk, regularly recur in different forms and 
under different conditions to generate risks to financial stability, 
and the Analytic Framework describes vulnerabilities that commonly 
generate or exacerbate risks to financial stability and the mechanisms 
by which negative effects can be transmitted more broadly.\38\ The 
Council may consider those risk factors and transmission channels in 
activities-based reviews, entity-specific analyses, or other work.\39\ 
Accordingly, the Council believes that describing these substantive 
analytic approaches broadly, rather than in a context limited to 
nonbank financial company designations, is most appropriate.
---------------------------------------------------------------------------

    \37\ At least one commenter stated that the Analytic Framework 
should be appended to the 2012 Rule--the Council's procedural rule 
on nonbank financial company designations--by incorporating it into 
the appendix to 12 CFR part 1310. The Analytic Framework explains 
how the Council approaches risks to financial stability generally, 
so it would not appropriately be appended to the 2012 Rule, which is 
focused exclusively on nonbank financial company designations.
    \38\ As discussed in section II.G below, the ``vulnerabilities'' 
described in the Analytic Framework do not imply an intention to 
consider a company's likelihood of material financial distress. The 
vulnerabilities described in the Analytic Framework are 
characteristics that most commonly contribute to risks to financial 
stability. They are not meant to relate to the likelihood of a 
company's material financial distress. Although some commenters 
equated a company's ``vulnerability'' with the company's likelihood 
of material financial distress, that is not how the Council uses the 
term in the Analytic Framework or the Final Guidance.
    \39\ Consistent with its longstanding precedent, the identified 
transmission channels are non-exhaustive. See 2019 Interpretive 
Guidance, 84 FR at 71,763 (Dec. 30, 2019) (``The transmission 
channels . . . set forth below are not exhaustive and may not apply 
to all nonbank financial companies under evaluation. . . . The 
Council may also consider other relevant channels through which 
risks could be transmitted from a particular nonbank financial 
company and thereby pose a threat to U.S. financial stability.''); 
see also 2012 Interpretive Guidance, 77 FR at 21,657 (April 11, 
2012) (``The Council intends to continue to evaluate additional 
transmission channels and may, at its discretion, consider other 
channels through which a nonbank financial company may transmit the 
negative effects of its material financial distress or activities 
and thereby pose a threat to U.S. financial stability.'').
---------------------------------------------------------------------------

    A number of commenters addressed the relationship between the 
statutory standards and statutory considerations for nonbank financial 
company designations, on one hand, and the vulnerabilities, sample 
metrics, and transmission channels described in the Analytic Framework, 
on the other hand. Some commenters questioned whether the Analytic 
Framework would displace the statutory standards and considerations 
established by section 113 of the Dodd-Frank Act, and other commenters 
asked for more detail regarding how the Council would apply the 
Analytic Framework's vulnerabilities, sample metrics, and transmission 
channels in the nonbank financial company designation context. Some 
commenters stated that the Proposed Analytic Framework and the Proposed 
Guidance did not provide enough detail on how the Council considers 
risks to financial stability.
    With respect to nonbank financial company designations, the Dodd-
Frank Act sets forth the standard for designations and certain specific 
considerations that the Council must take into account in making any 
determination under section 113. Consistent with the statutory 
requirements, the Council will apply the statutory standard and each of 
the 10 statutory considerations in evaluations of nonbank financial 
companies for potential designation.
    At the same time, the Analytic Framework describes the Council's 
approach to evaluating potential risks to U.S. financial stability, 
including in the context of a review under section 113 of the Dodd-
Frank Act. Accordingly, the vulnerabilities and transmission channels 
described in the Analytic Framework will inform the Council's 
assessment of the designation standard and mandatory considerations 
under section 113. As the Proposed Guidance and Final Guidance note, in 
the designation process, including to identify companies for potential 
review in Stage 1, the Council and its staff-level committees expect to 
consider the vulnerabilities, types of sample metrics, and transmission 
channels described in the Analytic Framework.
    Other commenters asked for greater detail on how the Council would 
assess the vulnerabilities described in the Analytic Framework. As also 
discussed in the preamble to the Analytic Framework, the Council has 
addressed these requests by adding further details to several listed 
vulnerabilities in the Analytic Framework regarding the types of sample 
metrics the Council expects to use to assess them.
    Some commenters noted that the vulnerabilities described in the 
Analytic Framework do not restate the 10 mandatory considerations in 
section 113 of the Dodd-Frank Act, and several objected to the 
vulnerabilities on that basis. A purpose of the Analytic Framework, 
however, is to provide transparency into how the Council considers 
risks to financial stability in general. Repetition of the statutory 
language applicable to nonbank financial company designations 
specifically would not further that goal. In the context of a review of 
a nonbank financial company under section 113 of the Dodd-Frank Act, 
the vulnerabilities and transmission channels described in the Analytic 
Framework clarify the statutory considerations. For example:
    <bullet> The section 113 considerations of leverage and 
concentration are both listed as vulnerabilities in the Analytic 
Framework, and the Analytic Framework provides additional insight into 
these issues.
    <bullet> The section 113 consideration of ``the extent and nature 
of the transactions and relationships of the company with other 
significant nonbank financial companies and significant bank holding 
companies'' may relate to the ``interconnections'' vulnerability and 
``exposures'' transmission channel in the Analytic Framework, among 
others.
    <bullet> The section 113 consideration of ``the amount and types of 
the liabilities of the company, including the degree of reliance on 
short-term funding'' may relate to a number of vulnerabilities in the 
Analytic Framework, including ``leverage,'' ``liquidity risk and 
maturity mismatch,'' ``interconnections,'' and ``inadequate risk 
management,'' as well as the ``exposures'' and ``asset liquidation'' 
transmission channels, among others.
    <bullet> The section 113 considerations of ``the importance of the 
company as a source of credit for households, businesses, and State and 
local governments and as a source of liquidity for the United States 
financial system'' and ``the importance of the company as a source of 
credit for low-income, minority, or underserved communities, and the 
impact that the failure of such company would have on the availability 
of credit in such communities'' may relate to the ``interconnections'' 
and ``concentration'' vulnerabilities and ``critical function'' 
transmission channel in the Analytic Framework, among others.
    <bullet> The section 113 consideration of ``the extent to which 
assets are managed rather than owned by the company, and the extent to 
which ownership of assets under management is diffuse'' may relate to 
the ``interconnections'' and ``concentration'' vulnerabilities in the 
Analytic Framework, among others, and each of the transmission 
channels.
    <bullet> The section 113 consideration of ``the degree to which the 
company is already regulated by 1 or more primary financial regulatory 
agencies'' may relate to the vulnerability of ``inadequate risk 
management,'' among others, and each of the transmission channels in 
the Analytic Framework.
    Although the Analytic Framework provides transparency into how the 
Council considers risks in general, the Council stresses that any 
determination regarding a nonbank financial company under section 113 
of the Dodd-Frank Act will be made based on the statutory

[[Page 80117]]

standard and considerations prescribed by Congress.
    Several commenters suggested that the Council should state 
explicitly how it intends to weight the various statutory 
considerations or the vulnerabilities, including by stating whether 
some are more important than others. Some commenters stated that, 
unless the Council explains how it will consider relevant statutory 
considerations and vulnerabilities with sufficient detail to allow any 
nonbank financial company to avoid designation, the Final Guidance and 
Analytic Framework provide inadequate notice to companies under 
consideration. However, the Council must consider all of the mandatory 
considerations Congress set forth in section 113 of the Dodd-Frank Act, 
and the relevance of any particular consideration will depend on the 
relevant facts and circumstances. Thus, an explicit weighting scheme, 
determined outside the context of a specific designation, may not be 
suitable to analyze a range of companies or conditions. The Dodd-Frank 
Act itself provides notice to companies regarding the standards and 
considerations the Council will rely on to make determinations under 
section 113. Further, the Dodd-Frank Act provides that a nonbank 
financial company under consideration for designation must receive a 
written notice and an explanation of the basis of any Proposed 
Determination in advance of an opportunity for a hearing.\40\ The Final 
Guidance (and Analytic Framework) go far beyond these statutory 
minimums to provide insight into how the Council considers risks in 
general and opportunities for a company under review to understand how 
the Council considers the threat the company's material financial 
distress or activities could pose to financial stability.

regarding how it assesses various particular financial stability risks. 
For example, since 2020, the Council has issued reports or statements

---------------------------------------------------------------------------

2. ``Threat'' To Financial Stability
    Under section 113 of the Dodd-Frank Act, the Council may designate 
a nonbank financial company if the Council determines that the 
company's material financial distress or activities ``could pose a 
threat to the financial stability of the United States.'' \46\ Under 
the Proposed Guidance, the Council proposed to evaluate a ``threat to 
the financial stability of the United States'' with reference to the 
description of ``financial stability'' provided in the Proposed 
Analytic Framework. In response to public comments on this approach, 
the Council has included, in the Analytic Framework as adopted in final 
form, an interpretation of ``threat to financial stability'' \47\ that 
is based on the interpretation of ``financial stability'' set forth in 
the Analytic Framework.
---------------------------------------------------------------------------

    \46\ Dodd-Frank Act section 113(a)(1), 12 U.S.C. 5323(a)(1). The 
Dodd-Frank Act separately sets forth the same statutory standard for 
the designation of foreign nonbank financial companies. Dodd-Frank 
Act section 113(b)(1), 12 U.S.C. 5323(b)(1). In the context of 
foreign nonbank financial companies, section 113 also lists the 
considerations that the Council must take into account, which are 
similar to the considerations applicable to U.S. nonbank financial 
companies, in some cases limited to the foreign nonbank financial 
companies' U.S. business or activities. See Dodd-Frank Act section 
113(b)(2), 12 U.S.C. 5323(b)(2). The Final Guidance and this 
preamble do not generally distinguish between U.S. nonbank financial 
companies and foreign nonbank financial companies, and the Council 
intends for the Final Guidance to apply in the same manner to both 
types of companies.
    \47\ The Council's statutory responsibilities related to 
financial stability are generally focused on the United States (see, 
e.g., Dodd-Frank Act section 112(a)(1)(A), 12 U.S.C. 5322(a)(1)(A) 
(``to identify risks to the financial stability of the United 
States''); 112(a)(1)(C), 5322(a)(1)(C) (``to respond to emerging

    A number of commenters stated that they supported the Council's 
interpretation of ``threat to the financial stability of the United 
States'' in the 2019 Interpretive Guidance and recommended that the 
Council define this term in the Final Guidance. Some commenters urged 
the Council to retain the interpretation of this term set forth in the 
2019 Interpretive Guidance or to revert to the interpretation in the 
2012 Interpretive Guidance.\48\ The Council believes the interpretation 
of ``threat to the financial stability of the United States'' in the 
2019 Interpretive Guidance imposed an inappropriately high threshold, 
as discussed below. One commenter stated that the interpretation of 
``financial stability'' in the Proposed Analytic Framework was at odds 
with the Financial Stability Board's interpretation of the term. The 
Council agrees that coordination with international bodies is 
important, but this consideration cannot supersede the Council's 
statutorily specified duties. In contrast, a number of commenters 
expressed concern that the 2019 definition eroded the Council's 
preventative role in risk mitigation. Some commenters stated that the 
2019 definition effectively precluded the Council from fulfilling its 
statutory duties to respond to potential or emerging threats to 
financial stability. Some commenters noted that while the Dodd-Frank 
Act calls on the Council to determine whether there ``could'' be a 
threat to financial stability, the 2019 definition required the Council 
to determine that the economy ``would'' be severely damaged.\49\
---------------------------------------------------------------------------

    \48\ The 2012 Interpretive Guidance stated the Council ``will 
consider a `threat to the financial stability of the United States' 
to exist if there would be an impairment of financial intermediation 
or of financial market functioning that would be sufficiently severe 
to inflict significant damage on the broader economy.'' 77 FR at 
21,657 (April 11, 2012).
    \49\ See also Dodd-Frank Act section 112(a)(2)(H), 12 U.S.C. 
5322(a)(2)(H) (setting forth the Council's duty to ``require 
supervision . . . for nonbank financial companies that may pose 
risks to . . . financial stability'' (emphasis added)).
---------------------------------------------------------------------------

    The Council appreciates this feedback and agrees that providing an 
interpretation of ``threat to financial stability'' provides clarity to 
nonbank financial companies and other stakeholders. As commenters 
noted, providing such an interpretation helps companies understand the 
substantive analytic approach the Council will use

[[Page 80118]]

for designations under section 113 of the Dodd-Frank Act and provides 
an indication of the significance of a potential threat to financial 
stability that may warrant a designation under section 113.
    The Proposed Analytic Framework interpreted ``financial 
stability,'' and the Council continues to view that interpretation as 
appropriate. The interpretation of ``threat to financial stability'' 
is, by its nature, closely related to the interpretation of ``financial 
stability,'' and can best be understood when considering these two 
terms together. Further, threats to financial stability will be 
evaluated within the framework of the Council's efforts to identify, 
assess, and respond to potential risks to financial stability, as set 
forth in the Analytic Framework. Therefore, the Analytic Framework 
offers the opportunity to situate the Council's interpretation of a 
threat to financial stability, whether posed by a nonbank financial 
company or originating from other sources, within the Council's broader 
approach.
    As noted above, many commenters expressed varying views regarding 
whether the Council should maintain the definition of ``threat to the 
financial stability of the United States,'' found in the 2019 
Interpretive Guidance, as ``the threat of an impairment of financial 
intermediation or of financial market functioning that would be 
sufficient to inflict severe damage on the broader economy.'' \50\ The 
Council views the 2019 definition as unwarranted, and, as many 
commenters noted, the 2019 definition contrasts sharply with the 
statutory standard under section 113 of the Dodd-Frank Act. In light of 
the Council's statutory duty to act to address potential threats to 
financial stability, the purpose of the designation authority in 
mitigating the risks of financial crises, and the uncertainty inherent 
in predicting future financial market developments, requiring the 
Council to determine that a nonbank financial company's material 
financial distress or activities could inflict ``severe damage'' on the 
broader economy creates an unduly high threshold for Council action. 
The Council must be able to address threats that may impair the 
financial system before they are realized. The nature of financial 
crises is that the precise severity of harm posed by emerging threats 
may not be apparent until it is too late.
---------------------------------------------------------------------------

---------------------------------------------------------------------------

    Some commenters stated that the interpretation of ``financial 
stability'' in the Proposed Analytic Framework would unduly lower the 
standard for designation under section 113 of the Dodd-Frank Act. The 
Council disagrees. The standard for designation is set forth in section 
113 itself. The Analytic Framework's interpretation of ``financial 
stability'' does not expand the statutory standard. Rather, the 
Analytic Framework describes how the Council considers financial 
stability and threats to it. However, in response to public comments, 
the Council has included in the Analytic Framework, as adopted in final 
form, an interpretation of ``threat to financial stability'' that is 
based on the proposed interpretation of ``financial stability'' and 
that includes an indication of the significance of a threat to 
financial stability: Events or conditions that could substantially 
impair the ability of the financial system to support economic activity 
would constitute a threat to financial stability. This approach 
clarifies that a designation under section 113 would not be justified 
if a nonbank financial company's material financial distress or 
activities could only cause immaterial impairments of the financial 
system.
    Some commenters indicated that the lack of concrete guidance on an 
interpretation of ``threat to the financial stability of the United 
States'' may dissuade nonbank financial companies from engaging in 
innovation and could lead to concentration risks. The Council notes 
that the definition of ``threat to the financial stability of the 
United States'' in the 2019 Interpretive Guidance did not specify 
particular activities or risk factors that could result in a 
designation under section 113 of the Dodd-Frank Act, but instead 
indicated the significance of a risk that could fall within the 
statutory standard for designation. The interpretation in the Analytic 
Framework, while reflecting different terminology than the 2019 
Interpretive Guidance, maintains this type of approach. For nonbank 
financial companies that wish to understand the activities or business 
characteristics that could lead to a potential designation under 
section 113--or that wish to mitigate the risks their material 
financial distress or activities could pose to financial stability--the 
Council encourages those companies to consider how the vulnerabilities 
and transmission channels described in the Analytic Framework may apply 
to their companies.
3. Suitability of Designation
    The Final Guidance sets forth the process the Council expects to 
follow when considering nonbank financial companies for potential 
designation. The Council's analytic approach to identifying, assessing, 
and responding to risks to financial stability and the substantive 
considerations it will take into account in determining whether to 
designate a company for prudential standards and supervision by the 
Federal Reserve are set forth in section 113 of the Dodd-Frank Act and 
the Analytic Framework. Neither the Proposed Guidance nor the Final 
Guidance addresses the suitability of designation with respect to any 
particular entity, sector, or circumstances. Nevertheless, the Council 
received a number of comments regarding the suitability of designation 
for certain sectors, entities, or circumstances as well as the merits 
and disadvantages of entity-based designation in general.
    Several commenters stated that designation under section 113 of the 
Dodd-Frank Act is not generally a suitable response to a threat to 
financial stability. Some stated that designation would result in 
regulation that may be ill-fitting for some types of nonbank financial 
companies, their products or services, or for financial risk channels 
that are different from those of bank holding companies. Some 
commenters stated that designations under section 113 are generally 
inadvisable because they would distort or disrupt markets or increase 
burdens for the designated nonbank financial company. However, the 
Dodd-Frank Act authorizes the Council to designate nonbank financial 
companies if their material financial distress or activities could pose 
a threat to financial stability. Further, the statute requires the 
Federal Reserve to adopt regulatory requirements applicable to a 
designated nonbank financial company and provides for the Federal 
Reserve to differentiate ``among companies on an individual basis or by 
category, taking into consideration their capital structure, riskiness, 
complexity, financial activities (including the financial activities of 
their subsidiaries), size, and any other risk-related factors that the 
Board of Governors deems appropriate.'' \51\ Therefore, the Council 
will not reject in advance the use of its statutory authority and is 
adopting the Final Guidance to explain the process it would use in 
considering nonbank financial companies for designation.
---------------------------------------------------------------------------

    \51\ Dodd-Frank Act section 165(a)(2)(A), 12 U.S.C. 
5365(a)(2)(A).
---------------------------------------------------------------------------

    As noted above, Congress created the designation authority based on 
lessons learned from the financial crisis in 2007-09, when financial 
distress at large, complex, highly interconnected, highly leveraged, 
and inadequately regulated nonbank financial companies

[[Page 80119]]

devastated the financial system. Potential risks to financial stability 
may often be addressed by existing regulators; however, if one or more 
nonbank financial companies, though their material financial distress 
or activities, could pose a threat to financial stability, Congress 
determined that designation of the relevant companies for Federal 
Reserve supervision and prudential standards is an appropriate 
response.
    Some commenters stated that the Proposed Guidance does not set 
forth with sufficient clarity the analyses the Council will conduct 
during the designation process or the prudential standards that will 
apply after designation. While the Council appreciates these comments, 
the Final Guidance does not address the substantive analytic factors to 
be used in designations because the Council has issued a separate 
document--the Analytic Framework--regarding its analytic approach for 
identifying and assessing potential risks to U.S. financial stability 
more broadly. Further, as noted above, Congress assigned responsibility 
to the Federal Reserve to determine the prudential standards that apply 
to a designated nonbank financial company, although the Council can 
recommend standards.
    Other commenters stated that the Council should make climate-
related financial risks a factor in the designation analysis of a 
nonbank financial company that may be subject to physical or transition 
climate-related risks. The Council appreciates these comments and has 
published a number of analyses regarding the emerging and increasing 
risks that climate change poses to the financial system. However, the 
Council believes that potential risks related to climate change may be 
assessed under the vulnerabilities, sample metrics, and transmission 
channels in the Analytic Framework. For example, to the extent that 
climate-related financial risks could result in defaults on a company's 
outstanding obligations, those risks may be considered, in part, 
through the ``interconnections'' vulnerability and the ``exposures'' 
transmission channel.
    Some commenters requested that the Council tailor the Final 
Guidance to one or more particular industries. As noted above, the 
Final Guidance does not set forth the substantive analyses the Council 
intends to apply in designation determinations. Instead, the Analytic 
Framework explains how the Council expects to consider any type of risk 
to financial stability, regardless of which of the Council's 
authorities may be used to address the risk. This approach seeks to 
strengthen the Council's ability to identify, assess, and respond to 
risks to U.S. financial stability, regardless of whether those risks 
originate from individual companies or widely conducted activities. The 
Council further notes that it expects to take into account relevant 
differences among various sectors, markets, or activities in the 
designation process, and to consult with a company's existing primary 
financial regulator. For example, the Council would take into account 
the extent to which assets are managed rather than owned by the 
company.\52\
---------------------------------------------------------------------------

    \52\ See Dodd-Frank Act section 113(a)(2)(F), 12 U.S.C. 
5323(a)(2)(F).
---------------------------------------------------------------------------

    Finally, some commenters stated that entity-based designation is 
not suitable for their industry, including life insurers, property and 
casualty insurers, reinsurers, asset managers, nonbank mortgage 
lenders, nonbank mortgage servicers, mutual funds (including money 
market mutual funds), private funds, fintech companies (including 
certain payment providers), and issuers of asset-backed securities. 
These commenters indicated that the Council should exclude certain 
types of companies from potential review. As it did in the 2019 
Interpretive Guidance, the Council declines to categorically exclude 
any particular financial sectors or types of nonbank financial 
companies from its assessment of potential threats to financial 
stability. The Council expects that any analysis of a nonbank financial 
company for potential designation will be tailored to reflect the 
unique attributes of the company and its existing regulatory framework, 
but assessing the suitability of designation of any class of nonbank 
financial companies would be premature. The substantive rigor under the 
Analytic Framework, the transparency under the Final Guidance, and the 
Council's adherence to the statutory requirements for designations will 
provide nonbank financial companies under review for potential 
designation with ample opportunities to raise risk-related factors 
during the Council's evaluation.

E. Activities-Based Approach

    The Dodd-Frank Act gives the Council a range of authorities and 
broad discretion to determine how to respond to potential threats to 
U.S. financial stability, and the statute does not prioritize among the 
Council's authorities. For example, pursuant to section 113 of the 
Dodd-Frank Act, the Council may determine that an individual nonbank 
financial company will be subject to supervision by the Federal Reserve 
and prudential standards if the Council determines that the company's 
material financial distress or activities could pose a threat to 
financial stability. The Dodd-Frank Act also gives the Council various 
authorities to make nonbinding recommendations to regulators.\53\
---------------------------------------------------------------------------

    \53\ See, e.g., Dodd-Frank Act sections 112(a)(2)(D), (F), (I), 
(K), and (N), 12 U.S.C. 5322(a)(2)(D), (F), (I), (K), and (N).
---------------------------------------------------------------------------

    The Council's response to a particular risk to financial stability 
depends on the nature of the risk. For example, vulnerabilities 
originating from activities that are widely conducted in a particular 
sector or market may be well-suited for activity-based or industry-wide 
regulation. In contrast, in cases where the financial system relies on 
the ongoing financial activities of a small number of entities, such 
that the impairment of one of the entities could threaten financial 
stability, or where a particular financial company's material financial 
distress or activities could pose a threat to financial stability, 
entity-based action may be appropriate.
    The Council's history provides instructive examples of the 
Council's use of different authorities and approaches for different 
types of risks. For example, the Council has taken an activities-based 
approach in recommending actions to address risks relating to crypto-
assets, climate-related financial risks, and other topics. In 2012, the 
Council used an activities-based approach in issuing for public comment 
proposed recommendations for money market mutual fund reforms. Further, 
all of the Council's annual reports have identified and recommended 
actions regarding various risks to U.S. financial stability,\54\ many 
in the form of an activities-based approach. The Council has also used 
entity-specific approaches in designating eight financial market 
utilities in 2012 under Title VIII of the Dodd-Frank Act and in 
designating four nonbank financial companies in 2013 and 2014 under 
section 113 of the Dodd-Frank Act.
---------------------------------------------------------------------------

    \54\ See, e.g., Council 2022 Annual Report, available at <a href="https://home.treasury.gov/system/files/261/FSOC2022AnnualReport.pdf">https://home.treasury.gov/system/files/261/FSOC2022AnnualReport.pdf</a>.
---------------------------------------------------------------------------

    However, the statute does not contemplate that one of the Council's 
authorities takes precedence over others, or that the Council must make 
recommendations to existing regulators before commencing a review of a 
company for potential designation. Financial crises have illustrated 
the importance of ensuring that the Council can exercise its 
authorities as needed. For example, the 2007-09 financial crisis showed 
that material financial distress at a small number of large,

[[Page 80120]]

interconnected, and highly leveraged nonbank financial companies could 
threaten the stability of the U.S. financial system. Many commenters 
cited the failure of American International Group (AIG), where 
regulators had not identified or addressed the risk the company 
ultimately posed to financial stability. In light of the experience 
during the financial crisis in 2007-09, the Dodd-Frank Act recognizes 
that relying on existing regulators is not sufficient in some 
circumstances. Congress did not structure the Dodd-Frank Act to 
deprioritize the Council's nonbank financial company designation 
authority.
    Nonetheless, the 2019 Interpretive Guidance stated that the Council 
would identify, assess, and address potential risks and threats to U.S. 
financial stability through a process that began with what it called an 
``activities-based approach.'' Under that guidance, the activities-
based approach meant the Council would rely on existing regulators to 
address potential threats to financial stability before the Council 
could consider designating a nonbank financial company.\55\ The 2019 
Interpretive Guidance further generally limited the use of designations 
under section 113 of the Dodd-Frank Act to cases where a potential risk 
or threat could not be adequately addressed by existing regulators. The 
Council received many comments favoring the prioritization of an 
activities-based approach over entity-specific designation, and many 
other comments advocating for the removal of the prioritization. The 
Final Guidance does not include the statement that the Council will 
first rely on existing regulators to address risks to financial 
stability before considering a nonbank financial company for potential 
designation.
---------------------------------------------------------------------------

    \55\ One commenter cited an estimate from two former 
Chairpersons of the Council and two former Chairs of the Federal 
Reserve Board that the nonbank financial company designation process 
under the 2019 Interpretive Guidance would take six years or more.
---------------------------------------------------------------------------

    The Council believes that rescinding the prioritization of an 
activities-based approach will better enable the Council to respond to 
threats to financial stability irrespective of their source. The 
Council agrees with the many commenters that stated that the Council 
should work closely with federal and state regulators. As discussed 
above and below, the Council engages extensively with federal and state 
financial regulatory agencies to identify, assess, and respond to risks 
to financial stability. The Council appreciates the expertise and 
experience, noted by many commenters, of primary financial regulators. 
The Council agrees with commenters that collaborating with existing 
regulators is critical. Under the Final Guidance, the Council will 
maintain its previous commitment to engaging extensively with existing 
regulators.
    Some commenters noted that other bodies, including the Financial 
Stability Board, have focused in recent years on an activities-based 
approach, and encouraged the Council to do the same. Some commenters 
also stated that an activities-based approach is the most effective 
means of addressing risks to the financial system. The Council believes 
that the availability of its full range of authorities is important to 
enable it to address the full range of potential risks to financial 
stability. In many respects, the Council agrees with reasons identified 
by commenters for supporting efforts by existing regulators to address 
potential risks to financial stability. For example, as commenters 
noted, in appropriate circumstances such actions can enable the 
mitigation of risks that arise from the activities of numerous 
financial companies in a particular sector or from financial products 
that are offered on a widespread basis. Other commenters stated that 
addressing risks through generally applicable regulatory requirements 
may increase fairness and reduce competitive disadvantages by promoting 
consistent treatment across firms. Some commenters stated that action 
by existing regulators may also be quicker than a Council designation 
process followed by the adoption of prudential standards by the Federal 
Reserve. The Council appreciates these points.
    Some commenters suggested that the prioritization of an activities-
based approach is appropriate, in part, because the Council is not a 
primary financial regulator and should defer to the judgment of primary 
financial regulators. During any designation review, the Council will 
consider the ``degree to which the company is already regulated by 1 or 
more primary financial regulatory agencies,'' \56\ but the statute does 
not prioritize this factor among the list of required considerations. 
While the Council engages routinely with primary financial regulators, 
as discussed above, Congress gave the Council itself the responsibility 
to reach judgments under the standard set forth in section 113 of the 
Dodd-Frank Act regarding potential threats to financial stability.
---------------------------------------------------------------------------

    \56\ Dodd-Frank Act section 113(a)(2)(H), 12 U.S.C. 
5323(a)(2)(H).
---------------------------------------------------------------------------

    Other commenters highlighted the benefits of nonbank financial 
company designations compared to other ways to respond to a potential 
threat to financial stability. Many commenters pointed out that 
designation may be more appropriate when a threat to U.S. financial 
stability arises from the material financial distress or activities of 
a particular nonbank financial company, and that in the event of such a 
risk, a designation may be a more targeted solution that does not 
impact all firms in the same market. Designation may also be more 
suitable when a large, complex, interconnected nonbank financial 
company is subject to varying levels of regulation across financial 
markets and regulatory jurisdictions. As some commenters stated, the 
potential impact of a nonbank financial company's material financial 
distress or activities on financial stability is frequently related to 
the interconnections and combination of financial risks across multiple 
business lines within a single company and the company's existing 
regulation and risk-management practices.
    One commenter also noted more holistic benefits of nonbank 
financial company designations. Designation may be a more effective 
deterrent against companies' actions that increase potential risks to 
financial stability because some companies may be able to avoid 
activities-based rules through regulatory arbitrage. Moreover, one 
commenter noted that designation, whose resulting regulatory regime 
includes resolution-planning requirements, supports the success of the 
Orderly Liquidation Authority under Title II of the Dodd-Frank Act, 
which is designed to limit the consequences of insolvencies when they 
do occur. Commenters also noted that the Council's nonbank financial 
company designation process enables firms to respond quickly, and that 
the Council can reconsider a previous designation if there are changes 
that reduce the potential threat to financial stability.
    Some commenters asserted that the Proposed Guidance indicates that 
the Council intends to prioritize an entity-based approach. This is 
incorrect. The Council does not intend to favor any of its statutory 
authorities over others. The Proposed Guidance and the Final Guidance 
focus on the nonbank financial company designation authority simply 
because the sole purpose of the guidance is to establish the Council's 
process for designating nonbank financial companies. Other Council

[[Page 80121]]

materials, including the Analytic Framework, describe how the Council 
may apply other authorities.

F. Cost-Benefit Analysis

    Although the Dodd-Frank Act does not require a cost-benefit 
analysis prior to the designation of a nonbank financial company, the 
2019 Interpretive Guidance stated that the Council would perform a 
quantitative cost-benefit analysis, whenever possible,\57\ as a 
prerequisite to designation. Under the Proposed Guidance, the Council 
would not conduct a cost-benefit analysis prior to a designation of a 
nonbank financial company. The Council received and considered numerous 
comments both favoring retention of cost-benefit analysis as a step in 
the designation process and advocating its removal. As described below, 
the Council does not believe that a cost-benefit analysis of individual 
designation determinations is legally required or reasonably estimable, 
useful, or appropriate in this context. Therefore, the Final Guidance 
does not contemplate the Council conducting a cost-benefit analysis 
prior to a nonbank financial company designation.
---------------------------------------------------------------------------

    \57\ The 2019 Interpretive Guidance further provided, ``If such 
benefits or costs cannot be quantified in this manner, the Council 
will explain why such benefits or costs could not be quantified.'' 
84 FR at 71,765 (Dec. 30, 2019).
---------------------------------------------------------------------------

    Section 113 of the Dodd-Frank Act sets forth the standard for 
designation, which directs the Council to determine whether ``material 
financial distress at [a] nonbank financial company, or the nature, 
scope, size, scale, concentration, interconnectedness, or mix of the 
activities of [a] nonbank financial company, could pose a threat to the 
financial stability of the United States.'' \58\ The Dodd-Frank Act 
also sets forth the list of considerations ``the Council shall 
consider'' ``[i]n making a determination'' to designate a nonbank 
financial company under section 113.\59\ Subsection 113(a)(2) lists 10 
explicit and mandatory considerations--including the company's 
leverage, transactions with other financial companies, assets under 
management, and existing regulation--as well as a permissive eleventh 
consideration: ``any other risk-related factors that the Council deems 
appropriate.'' \60\
---------------------------------------------------------------------------

    \58\ Dodd-Frank Act sections 113(a)(1) (with respect to U.S. 
nonbank financial companies) and (b)(1) (with respect to foreign 
nonbank financial companies), 12 U.S.C. 5323(a)(1) and (b)(1).
    \59\ Dodd-Frank Act section 113(a)(2), 12 U.S.C. 5323(a)(2).
    \60\ Id.
---------------------------------------------------------------------------

    The designation standard and the statutory considerations are 
focused on the threat a nonbank financial company's material financial 
distress or activities could pose to U.S. financial stability. Section 
113 establishes a structure for the Council's evaluation of a company 
and the risks it could pose to financial stability. This statutory 
structure does not contain, nor does it require the Council to perform, 
a cost-benefit analysis. The statute instructs the Council to focus on 
potential threats to financial stability, not the costs of designation 
to the company under review or to others. The potential costs and 
benefits of designation depend, among other things, on financial 
conditions, market behaviors, and the risk and magnitude of potential 
future financial crises that are inestimable with reasonable precision. 
Congress determined that when a nonbank financial company meets the 
statutory standard, designation is justified. The Council declines to 
second-guess that legislative judgment.
    Some commenters noted that neither the costs nor the benefits of 
designation appear in the considerations listed in section 113 of the 
Dodd-Frank Act, and that they are not similar to any of the listed 
considerations. The absence of a cost-benefit analysis requirement in 
section 113 contrasts with other provisions of the Dodd-Frank Act that 
do require cost-benefit analysis.\61\ As several commenters noted, this 
contrast demonstrates that Congress did not intend for the Council to 
perform a cost-benefit analysis when making determinations under 
section 113.
---------------------------------------------------------------------------

    \61\ See, e.g., Dodd-Frank Act sections 1013(d)(7)(A)(i)(IV) and 
1022(b)(2)(A)(i), 12 U.S.C. 5493(d)(7)(A)(i)(IV) and 
5512(b)(2)(A)(i).
---------------------------------------------------------------------------

    Further, some commenters noted that while Congress granted the 
Council discretion to consider other factors it ``deems appropriate,'' 
these too must be ``risk-related.'' \62\ Thus, under the text of 
section 113 of the Dodd-Frank Act, whether cost-benefit analysis is a 
prerequisite to designation depends on two inquiries: (1) is cost-
benefit analysis a ``risk-related factor,'' and (2) does ``the Council 
deem[ ] appropriate'' the consideration of costs and benefits in a 
designation? The answer to both is no.
---------------------------------------------------------------------------

    \62\ See Dodd-Frank Act section 113(a)(2)(K), 12 U.S.C. 
5323(a)(2)(K).
---------------------------------------------------------------------------

    Having considered the public comments on the Proposed Guidance, the 
Council does not believe that cost-benefit analysis, or its results or 
components, are ``risk-related factors,'' and does not expect to 
consider them. The Council believes the statutory reference to ``any 
other risk-related factors'' should be interpreted, consistent with the 
statutory standard for designation and the expressly enumerated 
considerations, as meaning a factor related to the risk to U.S. 
financial stability posed by a nonbank financial company's material 
financial distress or activities.\63\ Cost-benefit analysis is unlike 
any of the 10 explicit considerations the Council must take into 
account prior to designating a nonbank financial company. Each of the 
mandatory considerations--for example, a company's leverage, off-
balance-sheet exposures, and importance as a source of credit--all 
directly inform the threat a company's material financial distress or 
activities could pose to U.S. financial stability. Analysis of the 
costs and benefits of designation does not have that character. The 
Council acknowledges that there would be costs to a designated nonbank 
financial company associated with the Federal Reserve's prudential 
standards and supervision, but the Council does not believe that those 
costs would be ``risk-related factors.'' \64\
---------------------------------------------------------------------------

    \63\ This interpretation is also consistent with how the word 
``risk'' is used in surrounding provisions of the Dodd-Frank Act. 
See, e.g., Dodd-Frank Act sections 112, 115, 120, 121, and 123, 12 
U.S.C. 5322, 5325, 5330, 5331, and 5333.
    \64\ Under section 165 of the Dodd-Frank Act, the Federal 
Reserve has authority to establish prudential standards applicable 
to designated nonbank financial companies, and the Council may 
recommend standards under section 115 of the Dodd-Frank Act. 12

---------------------------------------------------------------------------

    Some commenters contended that the costs of designation could be so 
great as to increase the threat to financial stability that a company's 
material financial distress or activities could pose. Thus, these 
commenters stated, the costs of designation should also be considered a 
risk-related factor. However, the Council does not believe that 
commenters on the Proposed Guidance identified a credible scenario in 
which the costs of designation could be relevant to the assessment of 
the threat a company's material financial distress or activities could 
pose to financial stability.\65\ That is, while commenters noted that 
costs of designation hypothetically could affect a company's financial 
position, they did not convincingly demonstrate that such costs could 
affect the threat to financial stability posed by the company's

[[Page 80122]]

material financial distress, were it to occur, or activities. Moreover, 
the purpose of the prudential standards and Federal Reserve supervision 
applicable to a designated nonbank financial company is to mitigate the 
threat to financial stability that the company's material financial 
distress or activities could pose. For example, even if they were 
costly to implement, risk-based capital requirements, leverage limits, 
or liquidity requirements reduce risks posed by companies to the 
financial system. Notwithstanding the potential costs of a Council 
designation, Congress set out a process by which companies should be 
evaluated and, if they meet the statutory standard, subject to 
prudential standards and Federal Reserve supervision.
---------------------------------------------------------------------------

    \65\ While, for the reasons described in this section, the 
Council does not expect to consider any anticipated costs of 
designation, under the Final Guidance a company under review may 
submit to the Council any information the company deems relevant to 
the Council's evaluation under the statutory standard for 
designation. Consistent with section 113(a)(2)(K) of the Dodd-Frank 
Act, 12 U.S.C. 5323(a)(2)(K), the Final Guidance does not preclude 
the Council from considering any risk-related factors, including 
factors that the Council later determines to be risk-related, if the 
Council deems their consideration appropriate.
---------------------------------------------------------------------------

    Other commenters contended that costs accruing to the market more 
generally (e.g., potential competitive harms) or the results of a cost-
benefit analysis assessing the effect of designation on the broader 
economy could be ``risk-related factors.'' However, the standard 
Congress chose for nonbank financial company designations indicates 
that such costs and cost-benefit analysis are not ``risk-related 
factors.'' The Council does not believe that cost-benefit analysis 
indicates whether a company's material financial distress or activities 
``could pose a threat to the financial stability of the United 
States,'' the standard for designation under section 113. As noted 
above, in adopting this statutory standard, Congress determined that if 
a company meets the standard, based on the considerations Congress 
identified, the designation is justified.\66\
---------------------------------------------------------------------------

    \66\ See also Dodd-Frank Act section 112(a)(2)(H), 12 U.S.C. 
5322(a)(2)(H) (providing that ``[t]he Council shall . . . require 
supervision by the Board of Governors for nonbank financial 
companies that may pose risks to the financial stability of the 
United States in the event of their material financial distress or 
failure, or because of their activities pursuant to section 113'' 
(emphasis added)).
---------------------------------------------------------------------------

    Even if the cost of designation or the results of cost-benefit 
analysis were ``risk-related factors,'' the Council does not deem 
appropriate their consideration as a prerequisite to designation. A 
cost-benefit analysis aimed at assessing the incremental costs 
resulting from a designation and the potential benefits from mitigating 
the threat a company's material financial distress or activities could 
pose to financial stability would be impossible to perform with 
reasonable precision. This is in part because, as some commenters 
noted, it is not feasible to estimate with any certainty the 
likelihood, magnitude, or timing of a future financial crisis. The 
costs to financial stability arising from the material financial 
distress or activities of a nonbank financial company will depend on 
the state of the economy, the financial system, and innumerable other 
factors at the time. The costs of any particular future financial 
crisis, and thus the benefits of its prevention or mitigation through 
designation or other measures, cannot be predicted. Even estimates of 
the costs of past crises (which approximate the benefits of their 
avoidance), in terms of reductions in gross domestic product (GDP), 
greater government expenses, increases in unemployment, or other 
factors, vary widely on the order of trillions of dollars.\67\
---------------------------------------------------------------------------

    \67\ One study cited by a commenter estimated the costs of a 
recent financial crisis to exceed an entire year of GDP. See Josh 
Bivens, ``Why is recovery taking so long--and who's to blame?,'' 
Economic Policy Institute (Aug. 11, 2016), <a href="https://www.epi.org/publication/why-is-recovery-taking-so-long-and-who-is-to-blame">https://www.epi.org/publication/why-is-recovery-taking-so-long-and-who-is-to-blame</a> 
(estimating the cumulative output gap in the economy at 133% of 
GDP). Other commenters cited a study that describes the large range 
of financial-crisis cost estimates, often differing by trillions of 
dollars, and notes the unsuitability of cost-benefit analysis for 
regulation aimed at improving financial stability. See John Coates 
IV, ``Cost-Benefit Analysis of Financial Regulation: Case Studies 
and Implications,'' The Yale Law Journal (Jan.-Feb. 2015), <a href="https://www.yalelawjournal.org/article/cost-benefit-analysis-of-financial-regulation">https://www.yalelawjournal.org/article/cost-benefit-analysis-of-financial-regulation</a>.
---------------------------------------------------------------------------

    The costs of designation to the designated company, the market, or 
others are also likely to evade useful estimation. These costs will 
depend critically on the applicable regulatory regime, which the Dodd-
Frank Act directs the Federal Reserve, not the Council, to adopt.\68\ 
Generally, specific regulatory requirements for previously designated 
nonbank financial companies have been determined after the designation, 
in order to enable the requirements to be appropriately tailored to 
risks posed by the company. Moreover, those requirements, along with 
the company's behavior in response to them and relevant market 
conditions, may vary over time. As such, evaluating the potential costs 
and benefits of a designation with reasonable specificity is not 
possible before a designation, and it is unlikely that performing a 
cost-benefit analysis for a nonbank financial company designation would 
yield a useful assessment. As noted by commenters, the infrequency and 
heterogeneity of past financial crises, combined with the unpredictable 
nature of financial markets and uncertain future evolution of financial 
firms and activities, do not provide a reliable basis for conducting an 
informative cost-benefit analysis. A cost-benefit analysis in this 
context is likely to produce results that are highly sensitive to 
discretionary assumptions and thus not helpful to decision-making. 
Accordingly, it is not surprising that Congress declined to prescribe a 
cost-benefit analysis as a prerequisite to designation.
---------------------------------------------------------------------------

    \68\ One commenter cited an estimate that AIG would have faced 
annual compliance costs between $100 million and $150 million 
related to its previous designation. The Council takes no position 
on the accuracy of this estimate, but notes that it is orders of 
magnitude smaller than the likely costs of a financial crisis.
---------------------------------------------------------------------------

    Some commenters also asserted that a cost-benefit analysis before a 
designation is legally required by the district court's decision in 
MetLife, Inc. v. Financial Stability Oversight Council (MetLife),\69\ 
the Supreme Court's decision in Michigan v. EPA,\70\ or the APA.\71\ 
The Council disagrees.
---------------------------------------------------------------------------

    \70\ 576 U.S. 743 (2015).
    \71\ One commenter also contended that a statement in the 
Proposed Guidance acknowledging that the guidance was subject to the 
procedures described in Executive Order 12866 (E.O. 12866), which 
generally directs agencies to consider the relevant costs and 
benefits of ``regulations'' and ``regulatory actions,'' undermines 
the Council's view that cost-benefit analysis is not a requirement 
of the designation process. However, E.O. 12866 defines 
``regulation'' to mean ``an agency statement of general 
applicability and future effect, which the agency intends to have 
the force and effect of law, that is designed to implement, 
interpret, or prescribe law or policy or to describe the procedure 
or practice requirements of an agency,'' and defines ``regulatory 
action'' as ``any substantive action by an agency . . . that 
promulgates or is expected to lead to the promulgation of a final 
rule or regulation.'' E.O. 12866 sections 3(e) and (f). The 
Council's designation determinations under section 113 of the Dodd-
Frank Act are neither ``regulations'' nor ``regulatory actions.'' 
Determinations under section 113 are thus not subject to E.O. 12866.
---------------------------------------------------------------------------

    The district court in MetLife rescinded one of the Council's 
previous designations under section 113 of the Dodd-Frank Act because, 
among other reasons, the Council did not consider the costs of the 
designation. However, as the MetLife court noted: ``This Court is one 
of 94 United States District Courts, comprising several hundred judges, 
and its Opinion is not binding on others; the Opinion stands on its own 
persuasive value, to the extent it has any.'' \72\ Furthermore, the 
MetLife court's

[[Page 80123]]

holding appears to rely, in part, on its assessment that a company's 
likelihood of material financial distress was a required consideration 
under the Council's guidance in effect at that time.\73\ As discussed 
below, the Final Guidance makes clear that the Council does not expect 
to consider the likelihood of a nonbank financial company's material 
financial distress; as a result, to the extent MetLife's reasoning 
relied on that requirement, it would not apply. In addition, while the 
court in MetLife viewed costs as a risk-related factor, it failed to 
take into account that the Council did not ``deem'' the cost of 
designation an appropriate risk-related factor to consider. Consistent 
with section 113(a)(2)(K) of the Dodd-Frank Act, because the Council 
did not deem cost appropriate to consider, its consideration was not 
required for the statutory reasons described above.

decision has limited significance even for MetLife itself. In the 
final settlement agreement between the Council and MetLife in 2018, 
the Council maintained that its designation of MetLife complied with 
applicable law, and MetLife expressly waived any right to argue that 
the cost-benefit portion of the district court's opinion had any 
preclusive effect in any future proceeding before the Council or in 
any subsequent litigation.

and citing Council's ``own Guidance'' as obligating the Council to

---------------------------------------------------------------------------

    Other commenters stated that Michigan v. EPA requires the Council 
to perform cost-benefit analyses of its designations. In Michigan, the 
Supreme Court considered whether cost-benefit analysis was required by 
a provision of the Clean Air Act directing the EPA to regulate certain 
hazardous emissions only if EPA found that ``such regulation is 
appropriate and necessary.'' \74\ The Court held that the requirement 
to determine that the regulation was ```appropriate and necessary' 
requires at least some attention to cost.'' Notably, the Court stated 
that it was not concluding the statute required EPA ``to conduct a 
formal cost-benefit analysis.'' \75\
---------------------------------------------------------------------------

---------------------------------------------------------------------------

    While section 113 of the Dodd-Frank Act also uses the word 
``appropriate,'' the context is entirely different. First, the phrase 
``any other risk-related factors that the Council deems appropriate'' 
is permissive, not mandatory.\76\ Unlike the EPA, which was directed to 
act only when it found that regulation was ``appropriate and 
necessary,'' \77\ under the Dodd-Frank Act, the Council has clear 
statutory authority to choose which ``other risk-related factors'' to 
consider by deeming them appropriate, or not. Second, section 113's 
permissive reference to ``appropriate'' is limited to ``risk-related 
factors,'' rather than other considerations that could conceivably 
influence agency decision-making, such as cost-benefit analysis. This 
interpretation of section 113 is consistent with the Supreme Court's 
decision in Michigan v. EPA, in which it noted that ``[t]here are 
undoubtedly settings in which the phrase `appropriate and necessary' 
does not encompass cost.'' \78\ Similarly, and more recently, the Court 
of Appeals for the D.C. Circuit has rejected the claim that the word 
``appropriate'' necessarily requires consideration of economic costs, 
in part, because the Supreme Court in Michigan v. EPA ``was careful to 
emphasize that its reading of `appropriate' was dependent on the 
statutory context . . . .'' \79\

    Several commenters argued that the APA's general prohibition on 
arbitrary and capricious agency action could require the Council to 
perform cost-benefit analysis, regardless of the standard and 
requirements set forth in the Dodd-Frank Act. However, the APA contains 
no such mandate, and the Supreme Court has long held that the APA's 
text sets forth the ``maximum procedural requirements'' courts may 
impose.\80\ Reading additional requirements into the APA ``would 
violate the very basic tenet of administrative law that agencies should 
be free to fashion their own rules of procedure.'' \81\

---------------------------------------------------------------------------

    A number of commenters stated that cost-benefit analysis is 
generally a helpful agency practice because it disciplines agency 
decision-making and leads to better policy outcomes. The Council takes 
no view on these propositions in general, but as discussed above, does 
not believe cost-benefit analysis would generally be appropriate in the 
context of nonbank financial company designations such that it should 
be a prerequisite to designation. Under the Analytic Framework, the 
Council anticipates that its analyses, including in the context of a 
designation under section 113 of the Dodd-Frank Act, will be rigorous, 
data-driven, and transparent. Other commenters contended that cost-
benefit analysis is necessary to ensure that designation will promote 
U.S. financial stability or generally do more good than harm. The 
Council disagrees. Under the statutory standard in section 113, the 
Council has authority to designate a nonbank financial company only if 
the company's material financial distress or activities could pose a 
threat to U.S. financial stability. Thus, the promotion of U.S. 
financial stability is already embedded in the designation standard.
    In addition, these commenters did not acknowledge the fact that the 
prudential standards will be developed by the Federal Reserve, and some 
presume it would regulate nonbank financial companies in a way that 
actually increases risks to financial stability. However, under its 
statutory mandate, the Federal Reserve would seek to establish 
prudential standards that would ``prevent or mitigate risks to the 
financial stability of the United States.'' \82\ The Federal Reserve 
will also take into consideration companies' ``capital structure, 
riskiness, complexity, financial activities (including the financial 
activities of their subsidiaries), size, and any other risk-related 
factors that the Board of Governors deems appropriate.'' \83\

G. Likelihood of Material Financial Distress

    As part of the evaluation of a company being considered for 
designation, the 2019 Interpretive Guidance provided that ``the Council 
will assess the likelihood of the company's material financial 
distress.'' \84\ The Final Guidance removes this ``likelihood 
assessment'' from the Council's designation procedures.\85\
---------------------------------------------------------------------------

    \84\ 84 FR at 71,766-67 (Dec. 30, 2019).
    \85\ The Council for many years consistently expressed the view 
that neither the Dodd-Frank Act nor the 2012 Interpretive Guidance 
contemplated the consideration of the likelihood of a nonbank 
financial company's material financial distress. The district court 
in MetLife held that, notwithstanding the Council's arguments to the 
contrary, the 2012 Interpretive Guidance required an assessment of 
the likelihood of a company's material financial distress. The 2019 
Interpretive Guidance altered the Council's approach by stating that 
the Council would consider this factor. The Final Guidance conforms 
to the Council's previous understanding that this factor should not 
be taken into account. To the extent that the 2012 Interpretive 
Guidance could reasonably be interpreted as committing the Council 
to consider this factor, the Council is now clarifying that it does 
not interpret the Dodd-Frank Act, the Final Guidance, or the 
Analytic Framework to contemplate an assessment of the likelihood of 
a company's material financial distress.

---------------------------------------------------------------------------

[[Page 80124]]

    The Council believes that assessing the likelihood of a company's 
material financial distress (referred to by some commenters as a 
company's ``vulnerability'' to financial distress) is neither required 
nor appropriate. As described below, such an assessment does not appear 
in relevant provisions of the Dodd-Frank Act, fits poorly with the 
statutory standard for designation, compromises the preventative nature 
of the designation authority, and could cause the very financial 
instability that a designation is intended to avert. Further, history 
provides myriad examples of the futility of predicting, years in 
advance, the likelihood of any specific financial company's material 
financial distress. Accordingly, the Council unequivocally declines to 
include any requirement to assess a company's likelihood of, or 
vulnerability to, material financial distress before a designation 
under section 113 of the Dodd-Frank Act.
    Congress authorized the Council to designate a company under 
section 113 of the Dodd-Frank Act if it ``determines that material 
financial distress at the U.S. nonbank financial company . . . could 
pose a threat to the financial stability of the United States.'' \86\ 
This standard (one of two statutory designation standards under section 
113) instructs the Council to determine whether a company's material 
financial distress could pose a threat to financial stability--not to 
assess how likely such distress is to occur. Thus, under section 113, 
the Council presupposes a company's material financial distress, and 
then evaluates what consequences for U.S. financial stability could 
follow.\87\ If those consequences ``could pose a threat'' to U.S. 
financial stability, designation is warranted. The first determination 
standard, thus, does not require or contemplate an assessment of how 
likely a company is to experience material financial distress. Put 
differently, the assessment under the first designation standard is 
binary. If a company's material financial distress, were it to occur, 
could pose a threat to financial stability, then the company meets the 
standard for designation; if not, the first standard for designation is 
not met. The likelihood of the company's material financial distress is 
not relevant to the statutory standard for designation.
---------------------------------------------------------------------------

    \86\ Dodd-Frank Act section 113(a)(1), 12 U.S.C. 5323(a)(1). See 
also Dodd-Frank Act section 113(b)(1) (with respect to foreign 
nonbank financial companies), 12 U.S.C. 5323(b)(1).
    \87\ Some commenters suggested that the Council should define 
``material financial distress.'' Both the Proposed Guidance and 
Final Guidance provide that the Council intends to interpret the 
term ``material financial distress'' as a nonbank financial company 
being in imminent danger of insolvency or defaulting on its 
financial obligations. This interpretation is unchanged from both 
the 2012 Interpretive Guidance and the 2019 Interpretive Guidance.
---------------------------------------------------------------------------

    Moreover, none of the 10 statutory considerations the Council must 
consider in making a determination under section 113 includes such a 
likelihood assessment. As some commenters pointed out, the Council's 
designation determinations take into account these statutory 
considerations, not the probability of material financial distress. 
Further, the 10 statutory considerations inform the Council's 
determination whether the statutory standard has been met; they do not 
alter the statutory standard.
    Some commenters contended that the 10 considerations in section 113 
of the Dodd-Frank Act imply that the Council must consider a nonbank 
financial company's likelihood of material financial distress. As noted 
above, the 10 considerations do not contain any language relating to 
such a likelihood assessment. Moreover, reading such a requirement into 
the statute would conflict, in different ways, with each of the two 
alternative statutory standards for designation. As noted above, the 
first designation standard turns on whether a company's material 
financial distress could pose a threat to financial stability, not how 
likely such distress is to occur. Section 112 of the Dodd-Frank Act 
underscores that the Council's duty is to designate ``nonbank financial 
companies that may pose risks to the financial stability of the United 
States in the event of their material financial distress or failure.'' 
\88\ By assigning the duty to designate nonbank financial companies 
that may pose risks ``in the event'' of their material financial 
distress or failure, section 112 emphasizes that the Council takes 
material financial distress or failure as a given and assesses what 
risks could flow from it.
---------------------------------------------------------------------------

    \88\ Dodd-Frank Act section 112(a)(2)(H), 12 U.S.C. 
5322(a)(2)(H).
---------------------------------------------------------------------------

    In contrast, the second designation standard under section 113 
provides for designation of a company if the Council determines that 
``the nature, scope, size, scale, concentration, interconnectedness, or 
mix of the activities of the U.S. nonbank financial company, could pose 
a threat to the financial stability of the United States.'' \89\ This 
second standard does not take into account or depend on the effects of 
a company's material financial distress, much less an assessment of its 
likelihood. For that reason, the 2019 Interpretive Guidance specified 
that the Council would undertake a likelihood assessment only under the 
first designation standard--not when the Council considers a company 
under the second designation standard.\90\ But the 10 statutory 
considerations apply to the second designation standard as well as the 
first designation standard. Therefore, to interpret the 10 statutory 
considerations as requiring the Council to assess a company's 
likelihood of material financial distress would contradict the plain 
meaning of section 113 by collapsing the two statutory designation 
standards--the second of which is not related to a company's material 
financial distress--into one.

---------------------------------------------------------------------------

    A number of commenters supported the Council's interpretation as 
proposed. Some commenters stated that proceeding with a designation 
only after a determination that the company's material financial 
distress is likely would alter the statutory standard--authorizing 
designation only when a company's material financial distress ``does 
threaten'' financial stability, rather than when it ``could pose a 
threat'' to financial stability.
    Further, the designation authority is preventative and is meant to 
``respond to emerging threats to the stability of the United States 
financial system,'' consistent with the Council's purpose.\91\ As some 
commenters underscored, permitting designation to occur only when the 
Council determines that a company is likely to fail, or has a 
reasonable or foreseeable likelihood of failure, would be damaging to 
financial stability. Waiting to act until there is an estimable 
likelihood of a company's failure would negate the purpose of the 
Council's designation authority, which is to mitigate risks before they 
actually threaten financial stability. The designation process under 
the Final Guidance will be a time-intensive exercise, and even once a 
company is designated, the Federal Reserve may then need to develop and 
implement prudential standards for the company. Such prudential 
standards, which may include capital and liquidity requirements, risk-
management standards, and the development of resolution plans, are 
intended to prevent or mitigate risks to financial

[[Page 80125]]

stability. For these tools to be most effective, they must be in place 
well before material financial distress appears on the horizon.
---------------------------------------------------------------------------

    \91\ See Dodd-Frank Act section 112(a)(1)(C), 12 U.S.C. 
5322(a)(1)(C).
---------------------------------------------------------------------------

    Some commenters argued that a likelihood assessment will help the 
Council identify which companies are suitable for designation. But 
there are good reasons that Congress chose not to require the Council 
to consider the likelihood of a nonbank financial company's material 
financial distress, and the Council does not believe it would be a 
useful consideration. As other commenters noted, companies that seem 
unlikely to experience financial distress may nonetheless experience 
material financial distress and rapidly threaten financial stability. A 
financial company can go from seemingly healthy to in danger of 
imminent collapse in a matter of months, weeks, or even days. For 
example, on September 10, 2008, Lehman Brothers reported shareholder 
equity--which is a measure of solvency--of $28 billion as of the end of 
August.\92\ Two days later, on September 12, 2008, ``experts from the 
country's biggest commercial investment banks . . . could not agree 
whether or not'' Lehman Brothers was solvent.\93\ The next business 
day, Monday, September 15, 2008, Lehman Brothers declared bankruptcy. 
The collapse of Long-Term Capital Management in 1998, which one 
commenter attributed to significant leverage and a lack of regulation, 
was similarly rapid.\94\ For designation to strengthen the financial 
system, it must be deployed early enough that companies have time to 
take actions to bolster their safety and soundness, which in turn 
supports financial stability--something that can take several years. 
Several commenters noted that even without the undue hurdles to 
designation imposed by the 2019 Interpretive Guidance, the designation 
process will likely remain lengthy, and stated that it is unrealistic 
to expect the Council to estimate the likelihood of a company's 
material financial distress potentially years in advance. The Council 
agrees.

    \94\ The more recent failures of Silicon Valley Bank and 
Signature Bank in March 2023 further underscore how quickly and 
unexpectedly a financial company can become insolvent.
---------------------------------------------------------------------------

    Finally, if the Council can only designate a company by taking into 
account the likelihood of the company's material financial distress, 
public awareness of a designation (or its mere possibility) could 
create a perception that the Council views the company as relatively 
likely to fail, causing a run on the company by its creditors and 
counterparties.\95\ This is an important reason why bank supervisory 
ratings are confidential, in acknowledgement of the risk that the 
disclosure of material issues at a company could trigger a run on the 
company. Thus, a designation that includes an assessment of the 
likelihood of material financial distress at the company could 
accelerate the company's demise and thereby threaten financial 
stability.
---------------------------------------------------------------------------

    \95\ While a likelihood assessment would presumably not be 
treated differently than other elements of the designation process 
with respect to the Council's confidentiality procedures, a company 
under consideration for designation may publicly disclose that it is 
under review, either voluntarily or pursuant to otherwise applicable 
disclosure requirements. Further, under the Final Guidance the 
Council will publicly announce all Final Determinations.
---------------------------------------------------------------------------

    Some commenters interpreted a discussion of this issue in the 
preamble to the Proposed Guidance as indicating that designation under 
any procedures could cause a run on the nonbank financial company under 
consideration or otherwise give rise to material financial distress or 
financial instability. Some suggested that the Council should always 
consider the potential for designation itself to lead to material 
financial distress at the company. That is not the Council's view. 
Rather, the Council believes that its evaluation of a company's 
likelihood of material financial distress, or determination regarding 
the likelihood of a company's material financial distress as part of a 
designation, could trigger a run on the company. As evidenced by the 
four previous examples of the Council's use of the nonbank financial 
company designation authority, designation is unlikely to have that 
effect in the absence of a likelihood assessment; instead, designation 
leads to the establishment of prudential requirements and supervision 
by the Federal Reserve, which serve to mitigate the risks arising from 
material financial distress at the designated company.
    Some commenters contended that the Council must assess a company's 
likelihood of material financial distress because a company with no 
likelihood of distress could not possibly ``pose a threat'' to 
financial stability. These commenters misread the first designation 
standard. As noted above, that standard presupposes material financial 
distress at the company under consideration. Congress instructed the 
Council to take material financial distress as a given and assess the 
consequences. That a company might have a low likelihood of material 
financial distress does not change the inquiry under the statutory 
standard.
    Furthermore, the contention that a likelihood assessment is 
necessary because some companies are immune to material financial 
distress rests on a factual assumption the Council rejects. As 
discussed above, and as some commenters noted, there is little ability 
to predict, years in advance, the likelihood of any specific financial 
company's material financial distress, and history has revealed that 
even financial companies viewed as strong and stable can rapidly weaken 
and fail.\96\ Moreover, material financial distress may arise 
unpredictably from shocks generated outside of the financial system. 
For example, even companies with excellent financial risk management 
may experience material financial distress as a result of operational 
risks such as cyberattacks or other information technology 
failures.\97\
---------------------------------------------------------------------------

    \96\ Expected default frequencies (EDF) from Moody's Credit Edge 
and Kamakura default probability (KDP) are two off[hyphen]the-shelf 
metrics of the likelihood of default. During the 2007-09 financial 
crisis, both metrics provided little lead time ahead of material 
financial distress. EDFs rose above 5 percent for Fannie Mae and 
Freddie Mac in February 2008, about seven months before they were 
put into conservatorship. Lehman Brothers' EDF rose above 5 percent 
in June 2008, roughly two months before its bankruptcy. AIG's EDF 
remained below 5 percent until the day the Federal Reserve stepped 
in to rescue the firm. Similar patterns were observed at commercial 
banks. As summarized by the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation 
(FDIC), ``Throughout 2006, only about one-half of 1 percent of banks 
were on the problem list, the lowest percentage for any year for 
which these data are available (1980-2017), suggesting, incorrectly 
as it turned out, that the risk profile of the banking industry was 
at a historic low.'' FDIC, Crisis and Response: An FDIC History, 
2008-2013, at 106 (2017).
    \97\ Operational risks associated with inadequate or failed 
internal processes, people, and systems, or from external events, 
are inherent in most financial company products, activities, 
processes, and systems. An operational failure could result in 
material financial distress at a company if the failure impedes the 
company's ability to provide key products or services.
---------------------------------------------------------------------------

    Some commenters stated that, in the absence of a likelihood 
assessment, two companies that have vastly different probabilities of 
material financial distress (or of threatening financial stability) 
will receive equivalent treatment in the designation process. These 
concerns are misplaced. In a designation process, the Council 
determines whether a company's material financial distress or 
activities could pose a threat to financial stability. The supervisory 
regime and prudential requirements to mitigate that threat are 
established by the Federal Reserve, generally following the 
designation. As noted above, in developing prudential standards 
applicable to designated

[[Page 80126]]

nonbank financial companies, the Federal Reserve is required to 
differentiate among companies on an individual basis or by category, 
taking into consideration their capital structure, riskiness, 
complexity, financial activities, size, and any other risk-related 
factors that the Federal Reserve deems appropriate.\98\

    \98\ Dodd-Frank Act section 165(a)(2)(A), 12 U.S.C. 
5365(a)(2)(A).
---------------------------------------------------------------------------

    Other commenters stated that the Council must assess a company's 
likelihood of material financial distress under the first designation 
standard because, in their view, the court's decision in MetLife 
requires it. As noted in section II.F above, as a district court 
opinion, MetLife is not binding on any other court or the Council 
(outside of the specific orders entered in that proceeding). More 
fundamentally, the court in MetLife held that the Council's failure to 
assess the likelihood of MetLife's material financial distress was 
contrary to the 2012 Interpretive Guidance, which the court interpreted 
to require a likelihood assessment.\99\ The MetLife court did not hold 
that a likelihood assessment was required by the Dodd-Frank Act or any 
other source of law beyond the 2012 Interpretive Guidance. Because the 
Final Guidance unequivocally eliminates any statement that the Council 
will assess a company's likelihood of material financial distress, this 
element of the MetLife decision does not apply.
---------------------------------------------------------------------------

    \99\ 177 F. Supp. 3d at 233-39.
---------------------------------------------------------------------------

    Some commenters contended that the vulnerabilities or other factors 
described in the Proposed Analytic Framework implied an obligation to 
consider a company's likelihood of financial distress. The Council 
disagrees and does not intend to interpret the Analytic Framework in 
that manner. The Analytic Framework does not add to or modify the 
standard for designation. Rather, the Analytic Framework describes how 
the Council considers risks to financial stability generally, 
regardless of the tool used to address those risks. The 
``vulnerabilities'' described in the Analytic Framework do not imply an 
intention to consider a company's likelihood of material financial 
distress.
    Some commenters argued that in the absence of a likelihood 
assessment, the Council will inappropriately designate companies 
without considering all of the relevant factors or any mitigation by 
the company or its regulators, and in circumstances such that 
designation will harm economic growth or impair financial stability. 
Some commenters argued that because designation is an important action, 
the Council should read into the statutory standard additional 
requirements, including the likelihood assessment, that Congress did 
not expressly adopt. For the reasons described above, the Council does 
not view a likelihood assessment as relevant to the statutory standard, 
related to the statutory considerations, or appropriate in a 
designation analysis.

H. Other Comments Received

    The public comments on the Proposed Guidance were largely focused 
on the relatively small number of topics addressed above. However, the 
Council received and considered some comments addressing other issues. 
For example, one commenter stated that the Council should not designate 
nonbank financial companies during any period in which Congress is 
considering legislation related to financial stability. The Council 
believes that, pending any future legislation, the Council has a 
current statutory duty to carry out its responsibilities as directed by 
existing law.
    Another commenter suggested that following the failures of certain 
banks in the first half of 2023, the Council should table the Proposed 
Guidance and instead prioritize the identification and assessment of 
risks potentially affecting banks. The Council believes that the recent 
stress in the banking sector underscores the importance of actionable, 
durable, and transparent procedures for addressing potential threats to 
financial stability, consistent with the Final Guidance and the 
Analytic Framework.
    Some commenters who are commissioners of Council member agencies, 
but are not their chairs, expressed concern that only the chairs of 
their respective agencies are members of the Council. The Council 
appreciates the contributions of member agencies that are led by multi-
member bodies, and notes that the composition of the Council is 
dictated by the Dodd-Frank Act.
    One commenter stated that any Council member's public comments 
about potential designations could suggest prejudgment of the outcome 
before required procedural steps have occurred. The Council notes that 
it has reached no conclusions regarding the analysis of any nonbank 
financial company under the Final Guidance and the Analytic Framework 
and notes that the procedures in the Final Guidance are designed to 
provide many opportunities for companies under consideration to engage 
with staff of Council members and member agencies and to present 
relevant information to inform the views of the Council and its 
members.
    Several commenters expressed general support for the Proposed 
Guidance. Their reasons included that the changes proposed would help 
curb risks at nonbank entities, demonstrate the Council's commitment to 
promoting financial innovation while safeguarding financial stability, 
and restore the Council's ability to fulfill its mission. Commenters 
who expressed general opposition to the Proposed Guidance largely 
focused on changes from the 2019 Interpretive Guidance, arguing that 
the Council should retain elements of the 2019 Guidance that the 
proposal omitted. These points are discussed in the sections above.
    Other commenters expressed support for the Proposed Guidance while 
also urging the Council to take immediate steps to respond to perceived 
risks to financial stability. The Council believes the Final Guidance 
provides the Council with the ability to use its statutory designation 
authority in applicable circumstances while providing important 
procedural safeguards and ample opportunities for engagement with 
companies under review and their primary financial regulators.

III. Legal Authority of the Council and Status of the Final Guidance

    The Council has numerous authorities and tools under the Dodd-Frank 
Act to carry out its statutory purposes.\100\ The Council expects that 
its response to any potential risk or threat to U.S. financial 
stability will be based on an assessment of the circumstances. As the 
agency charged by Congress with broad-ranging responsibilities under 
sections 112 and 113 of the Dodd-Frank Act, the Council has the 
inherent authority to promulgate interpretive guidance under those 
provisions that explains and interprets the steps the Council intends 
to take in the determination process.\101\ The Council also has 
authority to issue procedural rules \102\ and policy

[[Page 80127]]

statements.\103\ The Final Guidance provides transparency to the public 
as to how the Council intends to exercise its statutory grant of 
discretionary authority. Except to the extent that the Final Guidance 
sets forth rules of agency organization, procedure, or practice, the 
Council has concluded that the Final Guidance does not have binding 
effect and does not impose duties on, or alter the rights or interests 
of, any person. Further, the Final Guidance does not change the 
statutory standards for the Council's actions and does not relieve the 
Council of the need to make entity-specific determinations in 
accordance with section 113 of the Dodd-Frank Act. The Final Guidance 
also does not limit the ability of the Council to take emergency action 
under section 113(f) of the Dodd-Frank Act if the Council determines 
that such action is necessary or appropriate to prevent or mitigate 
threats posed by a nonbank financial company to U.S. financial 
stability. As a result, the Council has concluded that the notice and 
comment requirements of the APA would not apply.\104\ However, in the 
Council's rule codified at 12 CFR 1310.3, the Council voluntarily 
committed that it would not amend or rescind Appendix A to 12 CFR part 
1310 without providing the public with notice and an opportunity to 
comment in accordance with the procedures applicable to legislative 
rules under 5 U.S.C. 553.\105\ Consequently, the Council followed those 
procedures with respect to the Final Guidance.
---------------------------------------------------------------------------

    \100\ See, for example, Dodd-Frank Act sections 112(a)(2), 113, 
115, 120, and 804, 12 U.S.C. 5322(a)(2), 5323, 5325, 5330, and 5463.
    \101\ Courts have recognized that ``an agency charged with a 
duty to enforce or administer a statute has inherent authority to 
issue interpretive rules informing the public of the procedures and 
standards it intends to apply in exercising its discretion.'' See, 
for example, Prod. Tool v. Employment & Training Admin., 688 F.2d 
1161, 1166 (7th Cir. 1982). The Supreme Court has acknowledged that 
``whether or not they enjoy any express delegation of authority on a 
particular question, agencies charged with applying a statute 
necessarily make all sorts of interpretive choices.'' U.S. v. Mead, 
533 U.S. 218, 227 (2001).
    \102\ See Dodd-Frank Act section 111(e)(2), 12 U.S.C. 
5321(e)(2).
    \103\ See Ass'n of Flight Attendants-CWA, AFL-CIO v. Huerta, 785 
F.3d 710 (D.C. Cir. 2015).
    \104\ See 5 U.S.C. 553(b)(A).
    \105\ Section 1310.3 does not apply to the Council's issuance of 
rules, guidance, procedures, or other documents that do not amend or 
rescind Appendix A. Thus, other Council materials, including 
documents that are referred to in but are not a part of the Final 
Guidance, such as the Council's separately issued Analytic 
Framework, hearing procedures, bylaws, and committee charters, are 
not subject to section 1310.3's requirements.
---------------------------------------------------------------------------

    It is the Council's intention that each portion of the Final 
Guidance, and the rescission of the 2019 Interpretive Guidance, should 
continue in effect if all or any other portion of the Final Guidance is 
held unlawful or otherwise set aside by a court. Further, if any 
portion of the Analytic Framework is held unlawful or otherwise set 
aside by a court, the Council intends that each portion of the Final 
Guidance that is not also held unlawful or otherwise set aside by a 
court should continue in effect. While the Final Guidance as a whole 
sets forth the process the Council intends to follow when considering a 
nonbank financial company for designation under section 113 of the 
Dodd-Frank Act, the Council would expect to follow any of the Final 
Guidance's remaining portions if other portions were no longer in 
effect, and for the reasons described above would not expect to follow 
any aspect of the 2019 Interpretive Guidance (other than with respect 
to those aspects of the Final Guidance that are identical to the 2019 
Interpretive Guidance). Similarly, the Council would expect to apply 
the Analytic Framework even if the Final Guidance, or any part of it, 
were no longer in effect.

IV. Paperwork Reduction Act

    The collection of information contained in the Final Guidance has 
been reviewed and approved by the Office of Management and Budget in 
accordance with the Paperwork Reduction Act of 1995 \106\ under control 
number 1505-0244. An agency may not conduct or sponsor, and a person is 
not required to respond to, a collection of information unless it 
displays a valid control number assigned by the Office of Management 
and Budget.
---------------------------------------------------------------------------

    \106\ 44 U.S.C. 3507(d).
---------------------------------------------------------------------------

    The collection of information under the Final Guidance is found in 
12 CFR 1310.20-23.
    The hours and costs associated with preparing data, information, 
and reports for submission to the Council constitute reporting and cost 
burdens imposed by the collection of information. The estimated total 
annual reporting burden associated with the collection of information 
in the Final Guidance is 1,000 hours. We estimate the cost associated 
with this information collection to be $562,500.
    In making this estimate, the Council estimates that due to the 
nature of the information likely to be requested, approximately 75 
percent of the burden in hours will be carried by financial companies 
internally at an average cost of $500 per hour, and the remainder will 
be carried by outside professionals retained by financial companies at 
an average cost of $750 per hour. In addition, in determining these 
estimates, the Council considered its obligation under 12 CFR 
1310.20(b) to, whenever possible, rely on information available from 
the OFR or any Council member agency or primary financial regulatory 
agency that regulates a nonbank financial company before requiring the 
submission of reports from such nonbank financial company. The Council 
expects that its collection of information under the Final Guidance 
would be performed in a manner that attempts to minimize burdens for 
affected financial companies. The aggregate burden will be subject to 
the number of financial companies that are evaluated in the 
determination process, the extent of information regarding such 
companies that is available to the Council through existing public and 
regulatory sources, and the amount and types of information that 
financial companies provide to the Council.
    The Proposed Guidance requested comment on the estimates and other 
assumptions in the proposed collection of information, but the Council 
received no comments in response to the questions presented.

V. Executive Orders 12866, 13563, and 14094

    Executive Orders 12866, 13563 and 14094 direct certain agencies to 
assess costs and benefits of available regulatory alternatives and, if 
regulation is necessary, to select regulatory approaches that maximize 
net benefits (including potential economic, environmental, public 
health and safety effects, distributive impacts, and equity). Pursuant 
to section 3(f) of Executive Order 12866, as amended by Executive Order 
14094, the Office of Information and Regulatory Affairs within the 
Office of Management and Budget has determined that the Final Guidance 
is a ``significant regulatory action.'' Accordingly, the Office of 
Management and Budget has reviewed the Final Guidance.

VI. Congressional Review Act

    Pursuant to the Congressional Review Act,\107\ the Office of 
Information and Regulatory Affairs designated this rule as a major rule

Appendix A to Part 1310--Financial Stability Oversight Council Guidance 
for Nonbank Financial Company Determinations

I. Introduction

    Section 113 of the Dodd-Frank Wall Street Reform and Consumer 
Protection Act (the Dodd-Frank Act) \1\ authorizes the Financial 
Stability Oversight Council (the Council) to determine that a 
nonbank financial company will be supervised by the Board of 
Governors of the Federal Reserve System (the Federal Reserve Board) 
and be subject to prudential standards, in accordance with Title I 
of the Dodd-Frank Act, if either (1) the Council determines that 
material financial distress at the nonbank financial company could 
pose a threat to U.S. financial stability, or (2) the nature, scope, 
size, scale, concentration, interconnectedness, or mix of the 
activities of the nonbank financial company could pose a threat to 
U.S. financial stability. Section 113 of the Dodd-Frank Act lists 
the considerations that the Council must take into account in making 
a determination. This guidance supplements the Council's rule 
regarding nonbank financial company determinations.\2\
---------------------------------------------------------------------------

    \1\ 12 U.S.C. 5323.
    \2\ See 12 CFR part 1310.
---------------------------------------------------------------------------

    Section II of this appendix outlines a two-stage process that 
the Council generally expects to follow when determining whether to 
subject a nonbank financial company to Federal Reserve Board 
supervision and prudential standards.\3\ Section III sets forth the 
process the Council expects to follow in conducting reevaluations of 
its previous determinations.
---------------------------------------------------------------------------

    \3\ The Council may waive or modify this process in its 
discretion if it determines that emergency circumstances exist, 
including if necessary or appropriate to prevent or mitigate threats 
posed by a nonbank financial company to U.S. financial stability in 
accordance with section 113(f) of the Dodd-Frank Act, 12 U.S.C. 
5323(f).
---------------------------------------------------------------------------

II. Process for Nonbank Financial Company Determinations

    Under section 113 of the Dodd-Frank Act, the Council may 
evaluate a nonbank financial company \4\ for an entity-specific 
determination. This section describes the process the Council 
expects to follow in general for those reviews.
---------------------------------------------------------------------------

    \4\ The Council intends to interpret the term ``company'' to 
include any corporation, limited liability company, partnership, 
business trust, association, or similar organization. See Dodd-Frank 
Act section 102(a)(4), 12 U.S.C. 5311(a)(4). In addition, the 
Council intends to interpret ``nonbank financial company supervised 
by the Board of Governors'' as including any nonbank financial 
company that acquires, directly or indirectly, a majority of the 
assets or liabilities of a company that is subject to a final 
determination of the Council. As a result, if a nonbank financial 
company subject to a final determination of the Council sells or 
otherwise transfers a majority of its assets or liabilities, the 
acquirer will succeed to, and become subject to, the Council's 
determination. As discussed in section III of this appendix A, a 
nonbank financial company that is subject to a final determination 
of the Council may request a reevaluation of the determination 
before the next required annual reevaluation, in an appropriate 
case. Such an acquirer can use this reevaluation process to seek a 
rescission of the determination upon consummation of its 
transaction.
---------------------------------------------------------------------------

a. Overview of the Determination Process

    As described in detail below, the Council expects generally to 
follow a two-stage process of evaluation and analysis when 
evaluating a nonbank financial company under section 113 of the 
Dodd-Frank Act. During the first stage of the process (Stage 1), a 
nonbank financial company identified for review will be notified as 
provided below and subject to a preliminary analysis, based on 
quantitative and qualitative information available to the Council 
primarily through public and regulatory sources. During Stage 1, the 
Council will permit, but not require, the company to submit relevant 
information. The Council will also consult with the company's 
primary financial regulatory agency \5\ or home country supervisor, 
as appropriate. This approach will enable the Council to fulfill its 
statutory obligation to rely whenever possible on information 
available through the Office of Financial Research (the OFR), 
Council member agencies, or the nonbank financial company's primary 
financial regulatory agency before requiring the submission of 
reports from any nonbank financial company.\6\
---------------------------------------------------------------------------

    \5\ See Dodd-Frank Act section 2(12), 12 U.S.C. 5301(12). In 
each stage of the Council's process under section 113 of the Dodd-
Frank Act, the Council may also consult with, solicit information 
from, or coordinate with other state or federal financial regulatory 
agencies that have jurisdiction over the nonbank financial company 
or its activities.
    \6\ See Dodd-Frank Act section 112(d)(3), 12 U.S.C. 5322(d)(3).
---------------------------------------------------------------------------

    Following Stage 1, any nonbank financial company that is 
selected for additional review will receive notice that it is being 
considered for a proposed determination that the company will be 
supervised by the Federal Reserve Board and be subject to prudential 
standards under Title I of the Dodd-Frank Act (a Proposed 
Determination) and that the company will be subject to in-depth 
evaluation during the second stage of review (Stage 2). Stage 2 will 
also involve the evaluation of additional information collected 
directly from the nonbank financial company. At the end of Stage 2, 
the Council may consider whether to make a Proposed Determination 
with respect to the nonbank financial company. If the Council makes 
a Proposed Determination, the nonbank financial company may request 
a hearing in accordance with section 113(e) of the Dodd-Frank Act 
and Sec.  1310.21(c) of the Council's rule regarding nonbank 
financial company determinations.\7\ After making a Proposed 
Determination and holding any written or oral hearing if requested, 
the Council may vote to make a final determination (a Final 
Determination).
---------------------------------------------------------------------------

    \7\ See 12 CFR 1310.21(c).
---------------------------------------------------------------------------

b. Stage 1: Preliminary Evaluation of Nonbank Financial Companies

    Stage 1 involves a preliminary analysis of nonbank financial 
companies to assess the risks they could pose to U.S. financial 
stability. In light of the preliminary nature of a review in Stage 
1, the Council expects that not all companies reviewed in Stage 1 
will proceed to Stage 2 or a Final Determination.

Identification of Company for Review in Stage 1

    The Council may evaluate one or more individual nonbank 
financial companies for an entity-specific determination under 
section 113 of the Dodd-Frank Act. The Council's staff-level 
committees are responsible for monitoring and analyzing financial 
markets, financial companies, the financial system, and issues 
related to financial stability. These committees monitor a broad 
range of asset classes, institutions, and activities, as described 
in the Council's Analytic Framework for Financial Stability Risk 
Identification, Assessment, and Response (the Analytic Framework), 
and as reflected in the Council's annual reports. In assessing 
potential risks, these committees consider the vulnerabilities, 
types of metrics, and transmission channels described in the 
Analytic Framework. These committees, in the course of their duties, 
will monitor each sector of the financial system at least annually 
and will report to the Deputies Committee \8\ regarding potential 
risks to U.S. financial stability that they identify. With respect 
to these monitoring and reporting activities, the Council's Systemic 
Risk Committee is responsible for monitoring and reporting on each 
financial sector, including information on identified firms and 
activities that may pose risks that merit further review, unless 
another Council committee or working group provides such updates to 
the Deputies Committee on a particular sector. The updates to the 
Deputies Committee will use applicable metrics as described in the 
Analytic Framework. The Deputies Committee is responsible for 
directing, coordinating, and overseeing the work of the Systemic 
Risk Committee and all of the Council's other staff-level committees 
and working groups in accordance with this guidance. If an 
identified risk relates to one or more financial companies that may 
merit review in the context of a potential determination under 
section 113, the Council may review those companies in Stage 1. 
Alternatively, the Deputies Committee may direct a staff-level 
committee or working group to further assess the identified risks, 
including consideration of whether the risks could be addressed by a 
designation under section 113 or by use of a different Council 
authority, such as recommendations to existing regulators. The 
Deputies Committee may also direct the Council's Nonbank Financial 
Companies Designations Committee (the Nonbank Designations 
Committee) \9\ to conduct an initial analysis of

[[Page 80129]]

the companies based on the risk-assessment approach described in the 
Analytic Framework. The purpose of such an analysis by the Nonbank 
Designations Committee would be to further inform the determination 
regarding whether one or more companies should be reviewed in Stage 
1, if needed. Following any such analysis by the Nonbank 
Designations Committee, the Council may review one or more companies 
in Stage 1. Any Council committee's identification, reporting, 
direction, analysis, or recommendation described in this paragraph 
will be made in accordance with such committee's bylaws or charter.
---------------------------------------------------------------------------

    \8\ The Council's Deputies Committee is composed of senior 
officials from each Council member and member agency. See Bylaws of 
the Deputies Committee of the Financial Stability Oversight Council, 
available at <a href="https://fsoc.gov">https://fsoc.gov</a>.
    \9\ The Nonbank Designations Committee supports the Council in 
fulfilling the Council's responsibilities to consider, make, and 
review Council determinations regarding nonbank financial companies 
under section 113 of the Dodd-Frank Act. See Charter of the Nonbank 
Financial Companies Designations Committee of the Financial 
Stability Oversight Council, available at <a href="https://fsoc.gov">https://fsoc.gov</a>.
---------------------------------------------------------------------------

    When evaluating the potential risks associated with a nonbank 
financial company, the Council may consider the company and its 
subsidiaries separately or together. This approach enables the 
Council to consider potential risks arising across the entire 
organization, while retaining the ability to make a determination 
regarding either the parent or any individual nonbank financial 
company subsidiary (or neither), depending on which entity the 
Council determines could pose a threat to financial stability.

Engagement With Company and Regulators in Stage 1

    The Council will provide a notice to any nonbank financial 
company under review in Stage 1 no later than 60 days before the 
Council votes on whether to evaluate the company in Stage 2. In 
Stage 1, the Council will consider available public and regulatory 
information. In order to reduce the burdens of review on the 
company, the Council will not require the company to submit 
information during Stage 1; however, a company under review in Stage 
1 may submit to the Council any information relevant to the 
Council's evaluation and may, upon request, meet with staff of 
Council members and member agencies who are leading the Council's 
analysis. The Council may request a page-limited summary of the 
company's submissions. In addition, staff representing the Council 
will, upon request, provide the company with a list of the primary 
public sources of information being considered during the Stage 1 
analysis, so that the company has an opportunity to understand the 
information the Council may rely upon during Stage 1. In addition, 
during discussions in Stage 1 with the company, the Council intends 
for representatives of the Council to indicate to the company 
potential risks that have been identified in the analysis. However, 
any potential risks identified at this stage are preliminary and may 
continue to develop until the Council makes a Final Determination. 
Through this engagement, the Council seeks to provide the company 
under review an opportunity to understand the focus of the Council's 
analysis, which may enable the company to act to mitigate any risks 
to financial stability and thereby potentially avoid becoming 
subject to a Council determination.
    The Council will also consider in Stage 1 information available 
from relevant existing regulators of the company. Under the Dodd-
Frank Act, the Council is required to consult with the primary 
financial regulatory agency, if any, for each nonbank financial 
company or subsidiary of a nonbank financial company that is being 
considered for a determination before the Council makes any Final 
Determination with respect to such company.\10\ For any company 
under review in Stage 1 that is regulated by a primary financial 
regulatory agency or home country supervisor, the Council will 
notify the regulator or supervisor that the company is under review 
no later than the time the company is notified. The Council will 
also consult with the primary financial regulatory agency, if any, 
of each significant subsidiary of the nonbank financial company, to 
the extent the Council deems appropriate in Stage 1. The Council 
will actively solicit the regulator's views regarding risks at the 
company and potential mitigants or aggravating factors. In order to 
enable the regulator to provide relevant information, the Council 
will share its preliminary views regarding potential risks at the 
company, if any and to the extent practicable, and request that the 
regulator provide information regarding those specific risks, 
including the extent to which the risks are adequately mitigated by 
factors such as existing regulation or the company's business 
practices. During the determination process, the Council will 
encourage the regulator to address any risks to U.S. financial 
stability using the regulator's existing authorities; if the Council 
believes regulators' or the company's actions have adequately 
addressed the potential risks to U.S. financial stability the 
Council has identified, the Council may discontinue its 
consideration of the company for a potential determination under 
section 113 of the Dodd-Frank Act.
---------------------------------------------------------------------------

    \10\ Dodd-Frank Act section 113(g), 12 U.S.C. 5323(g).
---------------------------------------------------------------------------

    Based on the preliminary evaluation in Stage 1, the Council, on 
a nondelegable basis, may vote to commence a more detailed analysis 
of the company by advancing the company to Stage 2, or it may decide 
not to evaluate the company further. If the Council votes not to 
advance a company that has been reviewed in Stage 1 to Stage 2, the 
Council will notify the company in writing of the Council's 
decision. The notice will clarify that a decision not to advance the 
company from Stage 1 to Stage 2 at that time does not preclude the 
Council from reinitiating review of the company in Stage 1.

c. Stage 2: In-Depth Evaluation

    Stage 2 involves an in-depth evaluation of a nonbank financial 
company that the Council has determined merits additional review.
    In Stage 2, the Council will review a nonbank financial company 
using information collected directly from the company, through the 
OFR, as well as public and regulatory information. The review will 
focus on whether material financial distress \11\ at the nonbank 
financial company, or the nature, scope, size, scale, concentration, 
interconnectedness, or mix of the activities of the company, could 
pose a threat to U.S. financial stability. The Analytic Framework 
describes the Council's approach to evaluating potential risks to 
U.S. financial stability, including in the context of a review under 
section 113 of the Dodd-Frank Act.
---------------------------------------------------------------------------

    \11\ The Council intends to interpret the term ``material 
financial distress'' as a nonbank financial company being in 
imminent danger of insolvency or defaulting on its financial 
obligations.
---------------------------------------------------------------------------

Engagement With Company and Regulators in Stage 2

    A nonbank financial company to be evaluated in Stage 2 will 
receive a notice (a Notice of Consideration) that the company is 
under consideration for a Proposed Determination. The Council also 
will submit to the company a request that the company provide 
information that the Council deems relevant to the Council's 
evaluation, and the nonbank financial company will be provided an 
opportunity to submit written materials to the Council.\12\ This 
information will generally be collected by the OFR.\13\ Before 
requiring the submission of reports from any nonbank financial 
company that is regulated by a Council member agency or a primary 
financial regulatory agency, the Council, acting through the OFR, 
will coordinate with such agencies and will, whenever possible, rely 
on information available from the OFR or such agencies. Council 
members and their agencies and staffs will maintain the 
confidentiality of such information in accordance with applicable 
law. During Stage 2, the company may also submit any other 
information that it deems relevant to the Council's evaluation. 
Information that may be considered by the Council includes details 
regarding the company's financial activities, legal structure, 
liabilities, counterparty exposures, resolvability, and existing 
regulatory oversight. Information requests likely will involve both 
qualitative and quantitative information. Information relevant to 
the Council's analysis may include confidential business information 
such as detailed information regarding financial assets, terms of 
funding arrangements, counterparty exposure or position data, 
strategic plans, and interaffiliate transactions.
---------------------------------------------------------------------------

    \12\ See 12 CFR 1310.21(a).
    \13\ See Dodd-Frank Act section 112(d), 12 U.S.C. 5322(d).
---------------------------------------------------------------------------

    The Council will make staff representing Council members 
available to meet with the representatives of any company that 
enters Stage 2, to explain the evaluation process and the framework 
for the Council's analysis. In addition, the Council expects that 
its Deputies Committee will grant a request to meet with a company 
in Stage 2 to allow the company to present any information or 
arguments it deems relevant to the Council's evaluation. If the 
analysis in Stage 1 has identified specific aspects of the company's 
operations or activities as the primary focus for the evaluation, 
staff will notify the company of those specific aspects, although 
the areas of analytic focus may change based on the ongoing 
analysis.
    During Stage 2 the Council will also seek to continue its 
consultation with the company's primary financial regulatory agency 
or home country supervisor in a timely manner before the Council 
makes a Proposed or Final Determination with respect to the company. 
The Council will continue to encourage the regulator during the 
determination process to address any risks to

[[Page 80130]]

U.S. financial stability using the regulator's existing authorities; 
as noted above, if the Council believes regulators' or the company's 
actions adequately address the potential risks to U.S. financial 
stability the Council has identified, the Council would expect to 
discontinue its consideration of the company for a potential 
determination under section 113 of the Dodd-Frank Act.
    Before making a Proposed Determination regarding a nonbank 
financial company, the Council will notify the company when the 
Council believes that the evidentiary record regarding the company 
is complete.\14\ The Council will notify any nonbank financial 
company in Stage 2 if the company ceases to be considered for a 
determination. Any nonbank financial company that ceases to be 
considered at any time in the Council's determination process may be 
considered for a potential determination in the future at the 
Council's discretion, consistent with the processes described above.
---------------------------------------------------------------------------

    \14\ See 12 CFR 1310.21(a)(3).
---------------------------------------------------------------------------

d. Proposed and Final Determinations

Proposed Determination

    Based on the analysis performed in Stage 2, a nonbank financial 
company may be considered for a Proposed Determination. A Proposed 
Determination requires a vote, on a nondelegable basis, of two-
thirds of the voting members of the Council then serving, including 
an affirmative vote by the Chairperson of the Council.\15\ Following 
a Proposed Determination, the Council will issue a written notice of 
the Proposed Determination to the nonbank financial company, which 
will include an explanation of the basis of the Proposed 
Determination.\16\ Promptly after the Council votes to make a 
Proposed Determination regarding a company, the Council will provide 
the company's primary financial regulatory agency or home country 
supervisor with the nonpublic written explanation of the basis of 
the Council's Proposed Determination (subject to appropriate 
protections for confidential information).
---------------------------------------------------------------------------

    \15\ 12 CFR 1310.10(b).
    \16\ See Dodd-Frank Act section 113(e)(1), 12 U.S.C. 5323(e)(1).
---------------------------------------------------------------------------

Hearing

    A nonbank financial company that is subject to a Proposed 
Determination may request a nonpublic hearing to contest the 
Proposed Determination in accordance with section 113(e) of the 
Dodd-Frank Act and Sec.  1310.21(c) of the Council's rule regarding 
nonbank financial company determinations.\17\ If the nonbank 
financial company requests a hearing in accordance with the 
procedures set forth in Sec.  1310.21(c), the Council will set a 
time and place for such hearing. The Council has published hearing 
procedures on its website.\18\ In light of the statutory timeframe 
for conducting a hearing, and the fact that the purpose of the 
hearing is to benefit the company, if a company requests that the 
Council waive the statutory deadline for conducting the hearing, the 
Council may do so in appropriate circumstances.

Street Reform and Consumer Protection Act, available at <a href="https://fsoc.gov">https://fsoc.gov</a>.
---------------------------------------------------------------------------

Final Determination

    After making a Proposed Determination and holding any requested 
written or oral hearing, the Council, on a nondelegable basis, may, 
by a vote of not fewer than two-thirds of the voting members of the 
Council then serving (including an affirmative vote by the 
Chairperson of the Council), make a Final Determination that the 
company will be subject to supervision by the Federal Reserve Board 
and prudential standards. If the Council makes a Final 
Determination, it will provide the company with a written notice of 
the Council's Final Determination, including an explanation of the 
basis for the Council's decision.\19\ The Council will also provide 
the company's primary financial regulatory agency or home country 
supervisor with the nonpublic written explanation of the basis of 
the Council's Final Determination (subject to appropriate 
protections for confidential information). The Council expects that 
its explanation of the basis for any Final Determination will 
highlight the key risks that led to the determination and include 
guidance regarding the factors that were important in the Council's 
determination. When practicable and consistent with the purposes of 
the determination process, the Council will provide a nonbank 
financial company with notice of a Final Determination at least one 
business day before publicly announcing the determination pursuant 
to Sec.  1310.21(d)(3), Sec.  1310.21(e)(3), or Sec.  1310.22(d)(3) 
of the Council's rule.\20\ In accordance with the Dodd-Frank Act, a 
nonbank financial company that is subject to a Final Determination 
may bring an action in U.S. district court for an order requiring 
that the determination be rescinded.\21\
---------------------------------------------------------------------------

    \19\ Dodd-Frank Act section 113(e)(3), 12 U.S.C. 5323(e)(3); see 
also 12 CFR 1310.21(d)(2) and (e)(2).

    \21\ See Dodd-Frank Act section 113(h), 12 U.S.C. 5323(h).
---------------------------------------------------------------------------

    The Council does not intend to publicly announce the name of any 
nonbank financial company that is under evaluation prior to a Final 
Determination with respect to such company. However, if a company 
that is under review in Stage 1 or Stage 2 publicly announces the 
status of its review by the Council, the Council intends, upon the 
request of a third party, to confirm the status of the company's 
review. In addition, the Council will publicly release the 
explanation of the Council's basis for any Final Determination or 
rescission of a determination, following such an action by the 
Council. The Council is subject to statutory and regulatory 
requirements to maintain the confidentiality of certain information 
submitted to it by a nonbank financial company or its 
regulators.\22\ In light of these confidentiality obligations, such 
confidential information will be redacted from the materials that 
the Council makes publicly available, although the Council does not 
expect to restrict a company's ability to disclose such information.
---------------------------------------------------------------------------

    \22\ See Dodd-Frank Act section 112(d)(5), 12 U.S.C. 5322(d)(5); 
see also 12 CFR 1310.20(e).
---------------------------------------------------------------------------

III. Annual Reevaluations of Nonbank Financial Company Determinations

    After the Council makes a Final Determination regarding a 
nonbank financial company, the Council intends to encourage the 
company or its regulators to take steps to mitigate the potential 
risks identified in the Council's written explanation of the basis 
for its Final Determination. Except in cases where new material 
risks arise over time, if the potential risks identified in writing 
by the Council at the time of the Final Determination and in 
subsequent reevaluations have been adequately addressed, generally 
the Council would expect to rescind its determination regarding the 
company.
    For any nonbank financial company that is subject to a Final 
Determination, the Council is required to reevaluate the 
determination at least annually, and to rescind the determination if 
the Council determines that the company no longer meets the 
statutory standards for a determination.\23\ The Council may also 
consider a request from a company for a reevaluation before the next 
required annual reevaluation, in the case of an extraordinary change 
that materially affects the Council's analysis.
---------------------------------------------------------------------------

    \23\ Dodd-Frank Act section 113(d), 12 U.S.C. 5323(d).
---------------------------------------------------------------------------

    The Council will apply the same standards of review in its 
annual reevaluations as the standards for an initial determination 
regarding a nonbank financial company: either material financial 
distress at the company, or the nature, scope, size, scale, 
concentration, interconnectedness, or the mix of the company's 
activities, could pose a threat to U.S. financial stability. If the 
Council determines that the company does not meet either of those 
standards, the Council will rescind its determination.
    The Council's annual reevaluations will generally assess whether 
any material changes since the previous reevaluation and since the 
Final Determination justify a rescission of the determination. The 
Council expects that its reevaluation process will focus on whether 
any material changes that have taken effect--including changes at 
the company, changes in its markets or its regulation, changes in 
the impact of relevant factors, or otherwise--result in the company 
no longer meeting the standards for a determination. In light of the 
frequent reevaluations, the Council's analyses will generally focus 
on material changes since the Council's previous review, but the 
ultimate question the Council will seek to assess is whether changes 
in the aggregate since the Council's Final Determination regarding 
the company have caused the company to cease meeting either of the 
statutory standards for a determination.
    During the Council's annual reevaluation of a determination 
regarding a nonbank financial company, the Council will provide the 
company with an opportunity to meet with representatives of the 
Council to discuss the scope and process for the review and to

[[Page 80131]]

present information regarding any change that may be relevant to the 
threat the company could pose to financial stability. In addition, 
during an annual reevaluation, the company may submit any written 
information to the Council the company deems relevant to the 
Council's analysis. During annual reevaluations, a company is 
encouraged to submit information regarding any changes related to 
the company's risk profile that mitigate the potential risks 
previously identified by the Council. Such changes could include 
updates regarding company restructurings, regulatory developments, 
market changes, or other factors. If the company or its regulators 
have taken steps to address the potential risks previously 
identified by the Council, the Council will assess whether the risks 
have been adequately mitigated to merit a rescission of the 
determination regarding the company. If the company explains in 
detail and in a timely manner potential changes it could make to its 
business to address the potential risks previously identified by the 
Council, representatives of the Council will endeavor to provide 
their feedback on the extent to which those changes may address the 
potential risks.
    If a company contests the Council's determination during the 
Council's annual reevaluation, the Council will vote on whether to 
rescind the determination and provide the company, its primary 
financial regulatory agency or home country supervisor, and the 
primary financial regulatory agency of its significant subsidiaries 
with a notice explaining the primary basis for any decision not to 
rescind the determination. If the Council does not rescind the 
determination, the written notice provided to the company will 
address the most material factors raised by the company in its 
submissions to the Council contesting the determination during the 
annual reevaluation. The written notice from the Council will also 
explain why the Council did not find that the company no longer met 
the standard for a determination under section 113 of the Dodd-Frank 
Act. In general, due to the sensitive, company-specific nature of 
its analyses in annual reevaluations, the Council generally would 
not publicly release the written findings that it provides to the 
company, although the Council does not expect to restrict a 
company's ability to disclose such information.
    Finally, the Council will provide each nonbank financial company 
subject to a Council determination an opportunity for an oral 
hearing before the Council once every five years at which the 
company can contest the determination.
