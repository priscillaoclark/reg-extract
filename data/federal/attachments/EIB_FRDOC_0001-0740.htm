SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION: By neutralizing the effect of export credit 
support offered by foreign governments and by absorbing credit risks 
that the private sector will not accept, Ex-Im Bank enables U.S. 
exporters to compete fairly in foreign markets on the basis of price 
and product. Under the Working Capital Guarantee Program, Ex-Im Bank 
provides repayment guarantees to lenders on secured, short-term working 
capital loans made to qualified exporters. The guarantee may be 
approved for a single loan or a revolving line of credit. In the event 
that a borrower defaults on a transaction guaranteed by Ex-Im Bank the 
guaranteed lender may seek payment by the submission of a claim.
    This collection of information is necessary, pursuant to 12 U.S.C. 
635(a)(1), to determine if such claim complies with the terms and 
conditions of the relevant working capital guarantee. The Notice of 
Claim and Proof of Loss, Working Capital Guarantee is used to determine 
compliance with the terms of the guarantee and the appropriateness of 
paying a claim. Export-Import Bank customers are submitting this form 
electronically.
