---------------------------------------------------------------------------

I. Description and Purpose of the Amendment

    The OLPP establishes procedures designed to facilitate the listing 
and trading of standardized options contracts on the options exchanges. 
The amendment to the OLPP adds MIAX Sapphire as a Sponsor. The other 
OLPP Sponsors are BOX, Cboe, Cboe BZX, Cboe C2, Cboe EDGX, MEMX, MIAX, 
MIAX Emerald, MIAX PEARL, Nasdaq, Nasdaq BX, Nasdaq GEMX, Nasdaq ISE, 
Nasdaq MRX, Nasdaq Phlx, NYSE American, NYSE Arca, and OCC. MIAX 
Sapphire has submitted an executed copy of the OLPP to the Commission 
in accordance with the procedures set forth in the OLPP regarding new 
Plan Sponsors. Section 7 of the OLPP provides for the entry of new Plan 
Sponsors to the OLPP. Specifically, Section 7 of the OLPP provides that 
an Eligible Exchange \8\ may become a Plan Sponsor of the OLPP by: (i) 
executing a copy of the OLPP, as then in effect; (ii) providing each 
then-current Plan Sponsor with a copy of such executed OLPP; and (iii) 
effecting an amendment to the OLPP, as specified in Section 7(ii) of 
the OLPP.\9\
---------------------------------------------------------------------------

    \8\ The OLPP defines an ``Eligible Exchange'' as ``a national 
securities exchange registered with the [Commission] in accordance 
with Section 6(a) of the [Act] that (1) has effective rules for the 
trading of options contracts issued and cleared by OCC approved in 
accordance with the provisions of the [Act] and the rules and 
regulations thereunder; and (2) is a party to the Plan for Reporting 
Consolidated Options Last Sale Reports and Quotation Information 
(the ``OPRA Plan'').'' See OLPP Section 7(i). MIAX Sapphire has 
represented that it has met both the requirements for being 
considered an Eligible Exchange. See Amendment, supra note 7 at 2.
    \9\ MIAX Sapphire has represented that it has executed a copy of 
the current Plan, amended to include MIAX Sapphire as a Plan Sponsor 
in Section 9 of the Plan, and has provided each current Plan Sponsor 
with a copy of the executed and amended Plan. See Amendment, supra 
note 7 at 2.

---------------------------------------------------------------------------

[[Page 64006]]

    Section 7(ii) of the OLPP sets forth the process by which an 
Eligible Exchange may effect an amendment to the OLPP to become a Plan 
Sponsor. Specifically, an Eligible Exchange must: (a) execute a copy of 
the OLPP as then in effect with the only change being the addition of 
the new Plan Sponsor's name in Section 9 of the OLPP; \10\ and (b) 
submit the executed OLPP to the Commission. The OLPP then provides that 
such an amendment will be effective when the amendment is approved by 
the Commission or otherwise becomes effective pursuant to Section 11A 
of the Act and Rule 608 thereunder.
---------------------------------------------------------------------------

    \10\ The list of Plan Sponsors is set forth in Section 9 of the 
OLPP.
---------------------------------------------------------------------------

II. Effectiveness of the OLPP Amendment

    The foregoing OLPP amendment has become effective pursuant to Rule 
608(b)(3)(iii) \11\ because it has been designated by the sponsors as 
involving solely technical or ministerial matters. At any time within 
sixty days of the filing of the amendment, the Commission may summarily 
abrogate the amendment and require that it be refiled pursuant to 
paragraph (a)(1) of Rule 608,\12\ if it appears to the Commission that 
such action is necessary or appropriate in the public interest, for the 
protection of investors, or the maintenance of fair and orderly 
markets, to remove impediments to, and perfect the mechanisms of, a 
national market system or otherwise in furtherance of the purposes of 
the Act.
