SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION: The purpose of the proposed Subcommittees 
would be to provide report(s) and/or recommendations to the GMAC that 
will identify and examine key issues that affect the integrity and 
competitiveness of U.S. markets and U.S. firms engaged in global 
business, including the regulatory challenges of a global marketplace 
that reflects the increasing interconnectedness of markets and the 
multinational nature of business, including for derivatives markets; 
and to assess and inform international standards through engagement 
with international policymakers and authorities in other jurisdictions, 
with a focus on global market structure, digital asset markets, and 
technical issues, respectively. The GMAC, in turn, would consider and 
discuss the report(s) and/or recommendations of each Subcommittee. 
Topics and issues the Subcommittees may consider include, but are not 
limited to, the following:
    <bullet> Global Market Structure Subcommittee. Identifying and 
assessing key issues and policy proposals with an impact on global

[[Page 12664]]

markets, including global market structure and access to markets.
    <bullet> Digital Asset Markets Subcommittee. Identifying and 
assessing key issues and policy proposals with respect to digital asset 
markets, including digital finance and tokenization of assets, non-
financial activities and Web3, and blockchain technology.
    <bullet> Technical Issues Subcommittee. Identifying and assessing 
key issues and policy proposals with respect to technical requirements 
that apply to global markets, including financial market 
infrastructures, market participants, end-users, and service providers.
    Each of the Subcommittees will provide its report(s) and/or 
recommendations directly to the GMAC and will not provide report(s) 
and/or recommendations directly to the Commission. No Subcommittee has 
the authority to make decisions on behalf of the GMAC, and no 
determination of fact or policy will be made by any of the 
Subcommittees on behalf of the Commission.
    The members of each of the Subcommittees will generally serve as 
representatives and provide advice reflecting the views of stakeholder 
organizations and entities throughout the derivatives and financial 
markets. Each of the Subcommittees may also include special government 
employees and regular government employees when doing so furthers its 
purpose. It is anticipated that each of the Subcommittees will hold at 
least three in-person or telephonic meetings per year. Members of each 
of the Subcommittees serve at the pleasure of the Commission, and will 
be appointed to serve two-year terms. Members of each of the 
Subcommittees do not receive compensation or honoraria for their 
services, and they are not reimbursed for travel and per diem expenses.
    Members of each of the Subcommittees will include individuals who 
are members of the GMAC and/or other individuals. For individuals who 
are not serving on the GMAC currently, the Commission seeks nominations 
of individuals from a wide range of perspectives, including from 
industry, academia, the government, and public interest groups. To 
advise the GMAC effectively, members of each Subcommittee must have a 
high level of expertise and experience with the subject matter of the 
Subcommittee. To the extent practicable, the Commission will strive to 
select members reflecting wide ethnic, racial, gender, and age 
representation.
    The Commission invites the submission of nominations for membership 
in each of the Subcommittees. Each nomination submission should include 
the proposed member's name, title, organization affiliation and 
address, email address and telephone number, as well as information 
that supports the individual's qualifications to serve on the relevant 
Subcommittee. The submission should also include the name, email 
address and telephone number of the person nominating the proposed 
Subcommittee member. Self-nominations are acceptable.
    Submission of a nomination is not a guarantee of selection as a 
member of a subcommittee. As noted in the GMAC's Membership Balance 
Plan, the Commission seeks to ensure that the membership of a 
Subcommittee is balanced relative to the particular issues addressed by 
the Subcommittee in question. The Commission may identify members for 
the Subcommittees based on a variety of methods. Such methods may 
include public requests for nominations for membership; recommendations 
from existing advisory committee members; consultations with 
knowledgeable persons outside the CFTC (industry, consumer groups, 
other state or federal government agencies, academia, etc.); requests 
to be represented received from individuals and organizations; and 
Commissioners' and CFTC staff's professional knowledge of those 
experienced in the global markets.
    The office of the Commissioner primarily responsible for the GMAC 
and the Subcommittees plays a primary, but not exclusive, role in this 
process and makes recommendations regarding membership to the 
Commission. The Commission, by vote, authorizes members to serve on 
each of the GMAC Subcommittees.

(Authority: 5 U.S.C. 1001 et seq.)

    Dated: February 23, 2023.
Robert Sidman,
Deputy Secretary of the Commission.
