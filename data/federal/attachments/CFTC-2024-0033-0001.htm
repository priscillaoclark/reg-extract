SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION: Under the PRA, 44 U.S.C. 3501 et seq., 
Federal agencies must obtain approval from the Office of Management and 
Budget (OMB) for each collection of information they conduct or 
sponsor. ``Collection of Information'' is defined in 44 U.S.C. 3502(3) 
and 5 CFR 1320.3 and includes agency requests or requirements that 
members of the public submit reports, keep records, or provide 
information to a third party. Section 3506(c)(2)(A) of the PRA, 44 
U.S.C. 3506(c)(2)(A), requires Federal agencies to provide a 60-day 
notice in the Federal Register concerning each proposed collection of 
information, including each proposed extension of an existing 
collection of information, before submitting the collection to OMB for 
approval. To comply with this requirement, the CFTC is publishing a 
proposed notice to extend the existing collection of information listed 
below. An agency may not conduct or sponsor, and a person is not 
required to respond to, a collection of information unless it displays 
a currently valid OMB control number.\1\

    Title: Reparations Complaint, CFTC Form 30 (OMB Control No. 3038-
0115). This is a request for an extension of a currently approved 
information collection.
    Abstract: Pursuant to Section 14 of the Commodity Exchange Act, 
members of the public may apply to the Commission to seek damages 
against Commission registrants for alleged violations of the Act and/or 
Commission regulations. The legislative intent of the Reparations 
program was to provide a low-cost, speedy, and effective forum for the 
resolution of customer complaints and to sanction individuals and firms 
found to have violated the Act and/or any regulations.
    In 1984, the Commission promulgated Part 12 of the Commission 
regulations to administer Section 14. Rule 12.13 provides the standards 
and procedures for filing a Reparations complaint. Specifically, 
paragraph (b) describes the form and content requirements of a 
complaint. CFTC Form 30 mirrors the requirements set forth in paragraph 
(b).
    The Commission began utilizing Form 30 in or about 1984. The form 
was created to assist customers, who are typically pro se and non-
lawyers. It was also designed as a way to provide proper notice to 
respondents of the charges against them. This form is critical to 
fulfilling this policy goal. The Commission implemented a web-based 
version of Form 30 in 2021 as an additional option for the public to 
submit reparations complaints online.
    With respect to the collection of information, the CFTC invites 
comments on:
    <bullet> Whether the proposed collection of information is 
necessary for the proper performance of the functions of the 
Commission, including whether the information will have a practical 
use;
    <bullet> The accuracy of the Commission's estimate of the burden of 
the proposed collection of information, including the validity of the 
methodology and assumptions used;
    <bullet> Ways to enhance the quality, usefulness, and clarity of 
the information to be collected; and
    <bullet> Ways to minimize the burden of collection of information 
on those who are to respond, including through the use of appropriate 
automated electronic, mechanical, or other technological collection 
techniques or other forms of information technology; e.g., permitting 
electronic submission of responses.
    You should submit only information that you wish to make available 
publicly. If you wish the Commission to consider information that you 
believe is exempt from disclosure under the Freedom of Information Act, 
a petition for confidential treatment of the exempt information may be 
submitted according to the procedures established in Sec.  145.9 of the 
Commission's regulations.\2\
---------------------------------------------------------------------------

    \2\ 17 CFR 145.9.
---------------------------------------------------------------------------

    The Commission reserves the right, but shall have no obligation, to 
review, pre-screen, filter, redact, refuse or remove any or all of your 
submission from <a href="http://www.cftc.gov">http://www.cftc.gov</a> that it may deem to be 
inappropriate for publication, such as obscene language. All 
submissions that have been redacted or removed that contain comments on 
the merits of the ICR will be retained in the public comment file and 
will be considered as required under the Administrative Procedure Act 
and other applicable laws, and may be accessible under the Freedom of 
Information Act.
    Burden Statement: The respondent burden for this collection is 
estimated to be as follows:
    Respondents/Affected Entities: Commodity futures customers.
    Estimated Number of Respondents: 15.
    Estimated Average Burden Hours per Respondent: 1.5.
    Estimated Total Annual Burden Hours: 23.\3\
---------------------------------------------------------------------------

    \3\ Total burden hours are 22.5 rounding to 23.
---------------------------------------------------------------------------

    Frequency of Collection: As applicable.
    There are no capital costs or operating and maintenance costs 
associated with this collection.
