formations, acquisitions, mergers, and nonbanking activities. The Board 
requires the submission of these filings for regulatory and supervisory 
purposes and to allow the Board to fulfill its statutory obligations

the Federal Register (89 FR 34246) requesting public comment for 60 
days on the extension, with revision, of the FR Y-3, FR Y-3N, and FR Y-
4. The Board proposed to revise the FR Y-3, FR Y-3N, and FR Y-4 forms 
and instructions to update or add certain citations and references; 
delete language that requires an explanation of the assumptions used in 
financial projections only if the projections deviate from historical 
performance; remove the sample publication from the instructions; add 
questions regarding groups acting in concert, individuals who would own 
10 percent or more of the applicant, and companies that would own five 
percent or more of the applicant; add a requirement that applicants 
provide a breakdown of pro forma equity; add a requirement that 
applicants identify any management official of the applicant who is 
also a management official at another depository institution; and add a 
question regarding the integration of the target into the applicant. 
The comment period for this notice expired on July 1, 2024. The Board 
did not receive any comments. The revisions will be implemented as 
proposed.
