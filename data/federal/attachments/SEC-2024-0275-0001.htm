45 days of the publication of notice of the filing of a proposed rule 
change, the Commission shall either approve the proposed rule change, 
disapprove the proposed rule change, or institute proceedings to

in Section 19(b)(2)(ii) of the Exchange Act.\7\ Section 19(b)(2)(ii) of 
the Exchange Act allows the Commission to designate a longer period for
