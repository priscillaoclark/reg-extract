SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION: 
    Title: Response to Notification of Termination of Exemptive Relief 
Issued Pursuant to Regulation 30.10 (OMB Control No. 3038-0116). This 
is a request for extension of a currently approved information 
collection.
    Abstract: Commission regulation 30.10 provides a process by which 
persons located outside the U.S. and subject to a comparable regulatory 
structure in the jurisdiction in which they are located to seek an 
exemption from certain of the requirements under Part 30 of the 
Commission's regulations. Regulation 30.10 codifies the process by 
which the Commission may terminate such exemptive relief after 
appropriate notice and opportunity to respond. Regulation 30.10(c)(3) 
provides any party affected by the Commission's determination to 
terminate relief with the opportunity to respond to the notification in 
writing no later than 30 business days following the receipt of the 
notification, or at such time as the Commission permits in writing. 
These reporting requirements are necessary for the ongoing evaluation 
of the effectiveness of the Commission's program for regulatory 
deference.
    An agency may not conduct or sponsor, and a person is not required 
to respond to, a collection of information unless it displays a 
currently valid OMB control number.\2\ On February 17, 2023, the 
Commission published in the Federal Register notice of the proposed 
extension of this information collection and provided 60 days for 
public comment on the proposed extension, 88 FR 10303 (``60-Day 
Notice''). The Commission did not receive any relevant comments on the 
60-Day Notice.
