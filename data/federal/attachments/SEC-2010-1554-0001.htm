I. Self-Regulatory Organization's Statement of the Terms of Substance 
of the Proposed Rule Change

    The ISE is proposing to extend an incentive plan for market makers 
in four foreign currency options (``FX Options''). The text of the 
proposed rule change is available on ISE's Web site at <A HREF="http://frwebgate.access.gpo.gov/cgi-bin/leaving.cgi?from=leavingFR.html&log=linklog&to=http://www.ise.com">http://
www.ise.com</A>, on the Commission's Web site at <A HREF="http://frwebgate.access.gpo.gov/cgi-bin/leaving.cgi?from=leavingFR.html&log=linklog&to=http://www.sec.gov">http://www.sec.gov</A>, at the 
principal office of the Exchange, and at the Commission's Public 
Reference Room.

II. Self-Regulatory Organization's Statement of the Purpose of, and 
Statutory Basis for, the Proposed Rule Change

    In its filing with the Commission, the Exchange included statements 
concerning the purpose of, and basis for, the proposed rule change and 
discussed any comments it received on the proposed rule change. The 
text of these statements may be examined at the places specified in 
Item IV below. The Exchange has prepared summaries, set forth in 
Sections A, B, and C below, of the most significant aspects of such 
statements.

A. Self-Regulatory Organization's Statement of the Purpose of, and 
Statutory Basis for, the Proposed Rule Change

1. Purpose
    The purpose of this proposed rule change is to extend an incentive 
plan for market makers in options on the New Zealand dollar (``NZD''), 
the Mexican peso (``PZO''), the Swedish krona (``SKA'') and the 
Brazilian real (``BRB'').\3\ On August 3, 2009, the Exchange adopted an 
incentive plan applicable to market makers in NZD, PZO and SKA,\4\ and 
on January 19, 2010, added BRB to the incentive plan.\5\ The Exchange 
subsequently extended the date by which market makers may join the 
incentive plan.\6\ The Exchange proposes to again extend the date by 
which market makers may join the incentive plan.
---------------------------------------------------------------------------

    \3\ The Commission previously approved the trading of options on 
NZD, PZO, SKA and BRB. See Exchange Act Release No. 34-55575 (April 
3, 2007), 72 FR 17963 (April 10, 2007) (SR-ISE-2006-59).
    \4\ See Exchange Act Release No. 34-60536 (August 19, 2009), 74 
FR 43204 (August 26, 2009) (SR-ISE-2009-59).
    \5\ See Exchange Act Release No. 34-61459 (February 1, 2010), 75 
FR 6248 (February 8, 2010) (SR-ISE-2010-07).
    \6\ See Exchange Act Release Nos. 34-60810 (October 9, 2009), 74 
FR 53527 (October 19, 2009) (SR-ISE-2009-80), 34-61334 (January 12, 
2010), 75 FR 2913 (January 19, 2010) (SR-ISE-2009-115), 34-61851 
(April 6, 2010), 75 FR 18565 (April 12, 2010) (SR-ISE-2010-27) and 
34-62503 (July 15, 2010), 75 FR 42812 (July 22, 2010) (SR-ISE-2010-
71).
---------------------------------------------------------------------------

    In order to promote trading in these FX Options, the Exchange has 
an incentive plan pursuant to which the Exchange waives the transaction 
fees for the Early Adopter \7\ FXPMM \8\ and all Early Adopter FXCMMs 
\9\ that make a market in NZD, PZO SKA and BRB for as long as the 
incentive plan is in effect. Further, pursuant to a revenue sharing 
agreement entered into between an Early Adopter Market Maker and ISE, 
the Exchange pays the Early Adopter FXPMM forty percent (40%) of the 
transaction fees collected on any customer trade in NZD, PZO SKA and 
BRB and pays up to ten (10) Early Adopter FXCMMs that participate in 
the incentive plan twenty percent (20%) of the transaction fees 
collected for trades between a customer and that FXCMM. Market makers 
that do not participate in the incentive plan are charged regular 
transaction fees for trades in these products. In order to participate 
in the incentive plan, market makers are required to enter into the 
incentive plan no later than September 30, 2010. The Exchange now 
proposes to extend the date by which market makers may enter into the 
incentive plan to December 31, 2010.
---------------------------------------------------------------------------

    \7\ Participants in the incentive plan are known on the 
Exchange's Schedule of Fees as Early Adopter Market Makers.
    \8\ A FXPMM is a primary market maker selected by the Exchange 
that trades and quotes in FX Options only. See ISE Rule 2213.
    \9\ A FXCMM is a competitive market maker selected by the 
Exchange that trades and quotes in FX Options only. See ISE Rule 
2213.
---------------------------------------------------------------------------

2. Statutory Basis
    The Exchange believes that the proposed rule change is consistent 
with the objectives of Section 6 of the Act,\10\ in general, and 
furthers the objectives of Section 6(b)(4),\11\ in particular, in that 
it is designed to provide for the equitable allocation of reasonable 
dues, fees and other charges among its members and other persons using 
its facilities. The Exchange believes the proposed rule change will 
permit additional market makers to join the incentive plan which in 
turn will generate additional order flow to the Exchange by creating 
incentives to trade these FX Options as well as defray operational 
costs for Early Adopter Market Makers.

B. Self-Regulatory Organization's Statement on Burden on Competition

    The proposed rule change does not impose any burden on competition 
that is not necessary or appropriate in furtherance of the purposes of 
the Act.

C. Self-Regulatory Organization's Statement on Comments on the Proposed 
Rule Change Received From Members, Participants or Others

    The Exchange has not solicited, and does not intend to solicit, 
comments on this proposed rule change. The Exchange has not received 
any unsolicited written comments from members or other interested 
parties.

III. Date of Effectiveness of the Proposed Rule Change and Timing for 
Commission Action

    The foregoing rule change has become effective pursuant to Section 
19(b)(3) of the Act \12\ and Rule 19b-4(f)(2) \13\ thereunder. At any 
time within 60 days of the filing of such proposed rule change, the 
Commission summarily may temporarily suspend such rule change if it 
appears to the Commission that such action is necessary or appropriate 
in the public interest, for the protection of investors, or otherwise 
in furtherance of the purposes of the Act.
