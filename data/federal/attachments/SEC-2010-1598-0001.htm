SECURITIES AND EXCHANGE COMMISSION

 
Submission for OMB Review; Comment Request

Upon Written Request, Copies Available From: Securities and Exchange 
Commission, Office of Investor Education and Advocacy, Washington, DC 
20549-0213.

Extension:
    Form N-CSR, SEC File No. 270-512, OMB Control No. 3235-0570.

    Notice is hereby given that, pursuant to the Paperwork Reduction 
Act of 1995 (44 U.S.C. 3501 et seq.), the Securities and Exchange 
Commission (the ``Commission'') has submitted to the Office of 
Management and Budget (``OMB'') a request for extension of the 
previously approved collection of information discussed below.
    Form N-CSR (17 CFR 249.331 and 274.128) is a combined reporting 
form used by management investment companies to file certified 
shareholder reports under the Investment Company Act of 1940 (15 U.S.C. 
80a-1 et seq.) (``Investment Company Act'') and under the Securities 
Exchange Act of 1934 (15 U.S.C. 78a et seq.) (``Exchange Act''). Form 
N-CSR is to be used for reports under Section 30(b)(2) of the 
Investment Company Act and Section 13(a) or 15(d) of the Exchange Act, 
filed pursuant to rule 30b2-1(a) under the Investment Company Act (17 
CFR 270.30b2-1(a)). Reports on Form N-CSR are to be filed with the 
Commission not later than 10 days after the transmission to 
stockholders of any report that is required to be transmitted to 
stockholders under rule 30e-1 under the Investment Company Act (17 CFR 
270.30e-1).
    The Commission estimates that there are 6,640 reports filed on Form 
N-CSR annually and that the average number of portfolios referenced in 
each filing is 3.75. The Commission further estimates that the hour 
burden for preparing and filing a report on Form N-CSR is 7.62 hours 
per portfolio. Given that filings on Form N-CSR are filed semi-
annually, filings on Form N-CSR require 15.24 hours per portfolio each 
year. The total annual hour burden for Form N-CSR, therefore, is 
estimated to be 154,686 hours.
    The current total annual cost burden to respondents for outside 
professionals associated with the collection of data relating to Form 
N-CSR is currently $1,119,001 and the new total annual cost burden to 
respondents is estimated to be $1,556,401, representing an increase of 
$437,400.
    The information collection requirements imposed by Form N-CSR are 
mandatory. Responses to the collection of information will not be kept 
confidential. An agency may not conduct or sponsor, and a person is not 
required to respond to a collection of information unless it displays a 
currently valid control number.
    Please direct general comments regarding the above information to 
the following persons: (i) Desk Officer for the Securities and Exchange 
Commission, Office of Management and Budget, Room 10102, New Executive 
Office Building, Washington, DC 20503 or send an e-mail to: Shagufta 
Ahmed at <A HREF="mailto:Shagufta_Ahmed@omb.eop.gov">Shagufta_Ahmed@omb.eop.gov</A>; and (ii) Jeffrey Heslop, Acting 
Director/CIO, Securities and Exchange Commission, C/O Remi Pavlik-
Simon, 6432 General Green Way, Alexandria, VA 22312, or send an e-mail 
to: <A HREF="mailto:PRA_Mailbox@sec.gov">PRA_Mailbox@sec.gov</A>. Comments must be submitted to OMB within 30 
days of this notice.

    Dated: October 13, 2010.
Florence E. Harmon,
Deputy Secretary.
