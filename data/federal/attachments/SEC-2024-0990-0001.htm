SECURITIES AND EXCHANGE COMMISSION

[Release No. 34-100557; File No. SR-MSRB-2024-01]


Self-Regulatory Organizations; Municipal Securities Rulemaking 
Board; Notice of Designation of Longer Period for Commission Action on 
Proceedings To Determine Whether To Approve or Disapprove a Proposed 
Rule Change To Amend MSRB Rule G-14 To Shorten the Timeframe for 
Reporting Trades in Municipal Securities to the MSRB

July 18, 2024.
    On January 12, 2024, the Municipal Securities Rulemaking Board 
(``MSRB'') filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission 
(``Commission''), pursuant to Section 19(b)(1) of the Securities 
Exchange Act of 1934 (``Act'') \1\ and Rule 19b-4 thereunder,\2\ a 
proposed rule change to (1) amend MSRB Rule G-14 (``Rule G-14''), on 
reports of sales or purchases, to (i) shorten the amount of time within 
which brokers, dealers, and municipal securities dealers (collectively, 
``dealers,'' and each individually, a ``dealer'') must report most 
transactions to the MSRB; and (ii) require dealers to report certain 
transactions with a new trade indicator, and make certain clarifying 
amendments, and (2) make conforming amendments to MSRB Rule G-12, on 
uniform practice (``Rule G-12''), and the MSRB's Real-Time Transaction 
Reporting System (``RTRS'') Information Facility (``IF-1'') to reflect 
the shortened reporting timeframe (collectively, the ``proposed rule 
change'').\3\ The proposed rule change was published for comment in the 
Federal Register on January 26, 2024.\4\ On April 22, 2024, the 
Commission instituted proceedings under Section 19(b)(2)(B) of the Act 
\5\ to determine whether to approve or disapprove the proposed rule 
change.\6\

    Section 19(b)(2) of the Act \7\ provides that, after initiating 
proceedings, the Commission shall issue an order approving or 
disapproving the proposed rule change not later than 180 days after the 
date of publication of notice of filing of the proposed rule change. 
The Commission may extend the period for issuing an order approving or

disapproving the proposed rule change, however, by not more than 60 
days if the Commission determines that a longer period is appropriate 
and publishes the reasons for such determination. The proposed rule 
change was published for comment in the Federal Register on January 26, 
2024.\8\ The 180th day after publication of the notice for this 
proposed rule change is July 24, 2024. The Commission is extending the 
time period for approving or disapproving the proposed rule change for 
an additional 60 days.

    The Commission finds that it is appropriate to designate a longer 
period within which to issue an order approving or disapproving the 
proposed rule change so that it has sufficient time to consider the 
proposed rule change and the issues raised therein. Accordingly, the 
Commission, pursuant to Section 19(b)(2) of the Act,\9\ designates 
September 20, 2024, as the date by which the Commission shall either 
approve or disapprove the proposed rule change (File No. SR-MSRB-2024-
01).
