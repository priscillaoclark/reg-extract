SECURITIES AND EXCHANGE COMMISSION

[SEC File No. 270-348, OMB Control No. 3235-0394]


Proposed Collection; Comment Request; Extension: Rule 15g-5

Upon Written Request, Copies Available From: Securities and Exchange 
Commission, Office of FOIA Services, 100 F Street NE, Washington, DC 
20549-2736

    Notice is hereby given that pursuant to the Paperwork Reduction Act 
of 1995 (``PRA'') (44 U.S.C. 3501 et seq.), the Securities and Exchange 
Commission (``Commission'') is soliciting comments on the existing 
collection of information provided for in Rule 15g-5--Disclosure of 
Compensation to Associated Persons in Connection with Penny Stock 
Transactions--(17 CFR 240.15g-5) under the Securities Exchange Act of 
1934 (15 U.S.C. 78a et seq.). The Commission plans to submit this 
existing collection of information to the Office of Management and 
Budget (``OMB'') for extension and approval.

[[Page 49250]]

    Rule 15g-5 requires brokers and dealers to disclose to customers 
the amount of compensation to be received by their sales agents in 
connection with penny stock transactions. The purpose of the rule is to 
increase the level of disclosure to investors concerning penny stocks 
generally and specific penny stock transactions.
    The Commission estimates that approximately 170 broker-dealers will 
spend an average of approximately 87 hours annually to comply with the 
rule. Thus, the total time burden is approximately 14,790 hours per 
year.
    Written comments are invited on: (a) whether the proposed 
collection of information is necessary for the proper performance of 
the functions of the Commission, including whether the information 
shall have practical utility; (b) the accuracy of the Commission's 
estimates of the burden of the proposed collection of information; (c) 
ways to enhance the quality, utility, and clarity of the information 
collected; and (d) ways to minimize the burden of the collection of 
information on respondents, including through the use of automated 
collection techniques or other forms of information technology. 
Consideration will be given to comments and suggestions submitted by 
August 12, 2024.
    An agency may not conduct or sponsor, and a person is not required 
to respond to, a collection of information under the PRA unless it 
displays a currently valid OMB control number.
    Please direct your written comments to: David Bottom, Director/
Chief Information Officer, Securities and Exchange Commission, c/o John 
Pezzullo, 100 F Street NE, Washington, DC 20549, or send an email to:

Assistant Secretary.
