    Notice is hereby given that the Securities and Exchange Commission 
(``Commission'') has issued an Order, pursuant to Section 17(d) of the 
Securities Exchange Act of 1934 (``Act''),\1\ approving and declaring 
effective an amendment to the plan for allocating regulatory 
responsibility (``Plan'') filed pursuant to Rule 17d-2 of the Act,\2\ 
by the American Stock Exchange LLC (``Amex''), BATS Exchange, Inc. 
(``BATS''), BATS Y-Exchange, Inc. (``BYX''), Chicago Board Options 
Exchange, Incorporated (``CBOE''), Chicago Stock Exchange, Inc. 
(``CHX''), EDGA Exchange, Inc. (``EDGA''), EDGX Exchange, Inc. 
(``EDGX''), the Financial Industry Regulatory Authority, Inc. 
(``FINRA''), International Securities Exchange, LLC (``ISE''), The 
NASDAQ Stock Market LLC (``Nasdaq''), National Stock Exchange, Inc. 
(``NSX''), New York Stock Exchange LLC (``NYSE''), NYSE Arca, Inc. 
(``NYSE Arca''), NYSE Regulation, Inc. (acting pursuant to authority 
delegated to it by NYSE) (``NYSE Regulation''), NASDAQ OMX BX, Inc. 
(``BX''), and NASDAQ OMX PHLX, Inc. (``Phlx'') (collectively, 
``Participating Organizations'' or ``parties'').

---------------------------------------------------------------------------

I. Introduction

    Section 19(g)(1) of the Act,\3\ among other things, requires every 
self-regulatory organization (``SRO'') registered as either a national 
securities exchange or national securities association to examine for, 
and enforce compliance by, its members and persons associated with its 
members with the Act, the rules and regulations thereunder, and the 
SRO's own rules, unless the SRO is relieved of this responsibility 
pursuant to Section 17(d) \4\ or Section 19(g)(2) \5\ of the Act. 
Without this relief, the statutory obligation of each individual SRO 
could result in a pattern of multiple examinations of broker-dealers 
that maintain memberships in more than one SRO (``common members''). 
Such regulatory duplication would add unnecessary expenses for common 
members and their SROs.
---------------------------------------------------------------------------

    \3\ 15 U.S.C. 78s(g)(1).
    \4\ 15 U.S.C. 78q(d).
    \5\ 15 U.S.C. 78s(g)(2).
---------------------------------------------------------------------------

    Section 17(d)(1) of the Act \6\ was intended, in part, to eliminate 
unnecessary multiple examinations and regulatory duplication.\7\ With 
respect to a common member, Section 17(d)(1) authorizes the Commission, 
by rule or order, to relieve an SRO of the responsibility to receive 
regulatory reports, to examine for and enforce compliance with 
applicable statutes, rules, and regulations, or to perform other 
specified regulatory functions.
---------------------------------------------------------------------------

    \6\ 15 U.S.C. 78q(d)(1).
    \7\ See Securities Act Amendments of 1975, Report of the Senate 
Committee on Banking, Housing, and Urban Affairs to Accompany S. 
249, S. Rep. No. 94-75, 94th Cong., 1st Session 32 (1975).
---------------------------------------------------------------------------

    To implement Section 17(d)(1), the Commission adopted two rules: 
Rule 17d-1 and Rule 17d-2 under the Act.\8\ Rule 17d-1 authorizes the 
Commission to name a single SRO as the designated examining authority 
(``DEA'') to examine common members for compliance with the financial 
responsibility requirements imposed by the Act, or by Commission or SRO 
rules.\9\ When an SRO has been named as a common member's DEA, all 
other SROs to which the common member belongs are relieved of the 
responsibility to examine the firm for compliance with the applicable 
financial responsibility rules. On its face, Rule 17d-1 deals only with 
an SRO's obligations to enforce member compliance with financial 
responsibility requirements. Rule 17d-1 does not relieve an SRO from 
its obligation to examine a common member for compliance with its own 
rules and provisions of the federal securities laws governing matters 
other than financial responsibility, including sales practices and 
trading activities and practices.
---------------------------------------------------------------------------

    \9\ See Securities Exchange Act Release No. 12352 (April 20, 
1976), 41 FR 18808 (May 7, 1976).
---------------------------------------------------------------------------

    To address regulatory duplication in these and other areas, the 
Commission adopted Rule 17d-2 under the Act.\10\ Rule 17d-2 permits 
SROs to propose joint plans for the allocation of regulatory 
responsibilities with respect to their common members. Under paragraph 
(c) of Rule 17d-2, the Commission may declare such a plan effective if, 
after providing for notice and comment, it determines that the plan is 
necessary or appropriate in the public interest and for the protection 
of investors, to foster cooperation and coordination among the SROs, to 
remove impediments to, and foster the development of, a national market 
system and a national clearance and settlement system, and is in 
conformity with the factors set forth in Section 17(d) of the Act. 
Commission approval of a plan filed pursuant to Rule 17d-2 relieves an 
SRO of those regulatory responsibilities allocated by the plan to 
another SRO.

    \10\ See Securities Exchange Act Release No. 12935 (October 28, 
1976), 41 FR 49091 (November 8, 1976).
---------------------------------------------------------------------------

II. The Plan

    On September 12, 2008, the Commission declared effective the 
Participating Organizations' Plan for allocating regulatory 
responsibilities pursuant to Rule 17d-2.\11\ The Plan is designed to 
eliminate regulatory duplication by allocating regulatory 
responsibility over Common NYSE Members \12\ or Common FINRA 
Members,\13\ as applicable (collectively ``Common Members''), for the 
surveillance, investigation, and enforcement of common insider trading 
rules (``Common Rules'').\14\ The Plan assigns regulatory 
responsibility over Common NYSE Members to NYSE Regulation for 
surveillance, investigation, and enforcement of insider trading by 
broker-dealers, and their associated persons, with respect to NYSE-
listed stocks and NYSE Arca-listed stocks, irrespective of the 
marketplace(s) maintained by the Participating Organizations on which 
the relevant trading may occur. The

[[Page 64756]]

Plan assigns regulatory responsibility over Common FINRA Members to 
FINRA for surveillance, investigation, and enforcement of insider 
trading by broker-dealers, and their associated persons, with respect 
to NASDAQ-listed stocks and Amex-listed stocks, as well as any CHX 
solely-listed stock, irrespective of the marketplace(s) maintained by 
the Participating Organizations on which the relevant trading may 
occur.
---------------------------------------------------------------------------

    \11\ See Securities Exchange Act Release No. 58536 (September 
12, 2008), 73 FR 54646 (September 22, 2008) (File No. 4-566).
    \12\ Common NYSE Members include members of the NYSE and at 
least one of the Participating Organizations.
    \13\ Common FINRA Members include members of FINRA and at least 
one of the Participating Organizations.
    \14\ Common rules are defined as: (i) Federal securities laws 
and rules promulgated by the Commission pertaining to insider 
trading, and (ii) the rules of the Participating Organizations that 
are related to insider trading. See Exhibit A to the Plan.
---------------------------------------------------------------------------

III. Proposed Amendment to the Plan

    On October 13, 2010, FINRA, the NYSE Regulation, and BYX submitted 
a proposed amendment to the Plan. The amended Plan contains three 
changes. First, the amended Plan adds BYX as a ``Participating 
Organization.'' Second, the amended Plan removes ISE as a Participating 
Organization. ISE ceased operating as an equities market on July 19, 
2010, and has provided written notice to all Participating 
Organizations of its intent to terminate its participation in the 
Agreement. Third, the amended Plan makes several technical corrections 
to update the names of certain Participating Organizations, including 
the Philadelphia Stock Exchange, Inc. to be NASDAQ OMX PHLX LLC; Boston 
Stock Exchange, Inc. to be NASDAQ OMX BX, Inc.; and American Stock 
Exchange LLC to be NYSE Amex LLC as well as updating contact 
information and the related rules of NASDAQ OMX BX.
    The parties have followed the requisite procedure as set forth in 
Paragraph 27 to the Plan regarding the addition of new SROs to the 
Plan. The amended Plan replaces the previous agreement in its entirety. 
The text of the proposed amended 17d-2 plan is as follows (additions 
are in italic; deletions are [bracketed]):
* * * * *

Agreement for the Allocation of Regulatory Responsibility of 
Surveillance, Investigation and Enforcement for Insider Trading 
Pursuant to Sec.  17(d) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, 15 
U.S.C. Sec.  78q(d), and Rule 17d-2 Thereunder

    This agreement (the ``Agreement'') by and among [the American Stock 
Exchange LLC (``Amex''),] BATS Exchange, Inc. (``BATS''), BATS Y-

to Sec.  17(d) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 (the ``Act''), 15 
U.S.C. Sec.  78q(d), and Securities and Exchange Commission (``SEC'') 
Rule 17d-2, which allow for plans to allocate regulatory responsibility 
among self-regulatory organizations (``SROs''). Upon approval by the 
SEC, this Agreement shall amend and restate the agreement among the 
Participating Organizations (except [EDGA and EDGX]BYX) approved by the 
SEC on [October 17, 2008]April 15, 2010.
---------------------------------------------------------------------------

    \*\ CBOE's allocation of certain regulatory responsibilities to 
NYSE/FINRA under this Agreement is limited to the activities of the 
CBOE Stock Exchange, LLC, a facility of CBOE.
    \+\ [ ISE's allocation of certain regulatory responsibilities to 
NYSE/FINRA under this Agreement is limited to the activities of the 
ISE Stock Exchange, LLC, a facility of ISE.]
---------------------------------------------------------------------------

    Whereas, NYSE delegates to NYSE Regulation the regulation of 
trading by members in its market, and NYSE Regulation is a subsidiary 
of NYSE, all references to NYSE Regulation in this Agreement shall be 
read as references to both entities;
    Whereas, the Participating Organizations desire to: (a) Foster 
cooperation and coordination among the SROs; (b) remove impediments to, 
and foster the development of, a national market system; (c) strive to 
protect the interest of investors; and (d) eliminate duplication in 
their regulatory surveillance, investigation and enforcement of insider 
trading;
    Whereas, the Participating Organizations are interested in 
allocating to NYSE Regulation[, Inc. (``NYSE Regulation'')] regulatory 
responsibility for Common NYSE Members for surveillance, investigation 
and enforcement of Insider Trading (as defined below) in NYSE Listed 
Stocks (as defined below) irrespective of the marketplace(s) maintained 
by the Participating Organizations on which the relevant trading may 
occur in violation of Common Insider Trading Rules;
    Whereas, the Participating Organizations are interested in 
allocating to FINRA regulatory responsibility for Common FINRA Members 
for surveillance, investigation and enforcement of Insider Trading in 
NASDAQ Listed Stocks, Amex Listed Stocks, and CHX Solely Listed Stocks 
irrespective of the marketplace(s) maintained by the Participating 
Organizations on which the relevant trading may occur in violation of 
Common Insider Trading Rules;
    Whereas, the Participating Organizations will request regulatory 
allocation of these regulatory responsibilities by executing and filing 
with the SEC a plan for the above stated purposes (this Agreement, also 
known herein as the ``Plan'') pursuant to the provisions of Sec.  17(d) 
of the Act, and SEC Rule 17d-2 thereunder, as described below; and
    Whereas, the Participating Organizations will also enter into 
certain Regulatory Services Agreements (the ``Insider Trading RSAs''), 
of even date herewith, to provide for the investigation and enforcement 
of suspected Insider Trading against broker-dealers, and their 
associated persons, that (i) are not Common NYSE Members (as defined 
below) in the case of Insider Trading in NYSE Listed Stocks, and (ii) 
are not Common FINRA Members (as defined below) in the case of Insider 
Trading in NASDAQ Listed Stocks, Amex Listed Stocks, and CHX Solely 
Listed Stocks.
    Now, therefore, in consideration of the mutual covenants contained 
hereafter, and other valuable consideration to be mutually exchanged, 
the Participating Organizations hereby agree as follows:
    1. Definitions. Unless otherwise defined in this Agreement, or the 
context otherwise requires, the terms used in this Agreement will have

responsibilities for surveillance, investigation and enforcement of 
Insider Trading by broker-dealers, and their associated persons, for

the relevant trading may occur in violation of the Common Insider 
Trading Rules (``NYSE's Regulatory Responsibility'').
    b. FINRA: Assumption of Regulatory Responsibilities. On the 
Effective Date of the Plan, FINRA will assume regulatory 
responsibilities for surveillance, investigation and enforcement of

    c. Change in Control. In the event of a change of control of a

    3. Certification of Insider Trading Rules.

hereby certify to NYSE Regulation and FINRA that their respective lists 
of Common Insider Trading Rules contained in Attachment A hereto are 
correct, and NYSE Regulation and FINRA hereby confirm that such rules

Participating Organization rules that qualify as Common Insider Trading 
Rules as defined in this Agreement. NYSE Regulation and FINRA shall 
review each Participating Organization's annual certification and 
confirm whether NYSE Regulation and FINRA agree with the submitted 
certified and updated list of Common Insider Rules by each of the 
Participating Organizations.
    4. No Retention of Regulatory Responsibility. The Participating 
Organizations do not contemplate the retention of any responsibilities 
with respect to the regulatory activities being assumed by NYSE 
Regulation and FINRA, respectively, under the terms of this Agreement. 
Nothing in this Agreement will be interpreted to prevent NYSE 
Regulation or FINRA from entering into Regulatory Services Agreement(s) 
to perform their Regulatory Responsibilities.
    5. Dually Listed Stocks. Stocks that are listed on more than one 
Participating Organization shall be designated as a NYSE Listed Stock,

transaction reporting plan for the equity security as set forth in 
paragraph 1.b. of Exhibit B.
    6. Fees. NYSE Regulation and FINRA shall charge Participating 
Organizations for performing their respective Regulatory 
Responsibilities, as set forth in the Schedule of Fees, attached as 
Exhibit B.
    7. Applicability of Certain Laws, Rules, Regulations or Orders. 
Notwithstanding any provision hereof, this Agreement shall be subject 
to any statute, or any rule or order of the SEC. To the extent such 
statute, rule, or order is inconsistent with one or more provisions of 
this Agreement, the statute, rule, or order shall supersede the 
provision(s) hereof to the extent necessary to be properly effectuated 
and the provision(s) hereof in that respect shall be null and void.
    8. Exchange Committee; Reports.
    a. Exchange Committee. The Participating Organizations shall form a 
committee (the ``Exchange Committee''), which shall act on behalf of 
all of Participating Organizations in receiving copies of the reports 
described below and in reviewing issues that arise under this 
Agreement. Each Participating Organization shall appoint a 
representative to the Exchange Committee. The Exchange Committee 
representatives shall report to their respective executive management 
bodies regarding status or issues under the Agreement. The 
Participating Organizations agree that the Exchange Committee will meet 
regularly up to four (4) times a year, with no more than one meeting 
per calendar quarter. At these meetings, the Exchange Committee will 
discuss the conduct of the Regulatory Responsibilities and identify 
issues or concerns with respect to this Agreement, including matters 
related to the calculation of the cost formula and accuracy of fees 
charged and provision of information related to the same. The SEC shall 
be permitted to attend the meetings as an observer.
    b. Reports. NYSE Regulation and FINRA shall provide the reports set 
forth in Exhibit C hereto and any

[[Page 64758]]

additional reports related to the Agreement reasonably requested by a 
majority vote of all representatives to the Exchange Committee at each 
Exchange Committee meeting, or more often as the Participating 
Organizations deem appropriate, but no more often than once every 
quarterly billing period.
    9. Customer Complaints.
    a. If a Participating Organization receives a copy of a customer 
complaint relating to Insider Trading or other activity or conduct that 
is within the NYSE's Regulatory Responsibilities as set forth in this 
Agreement, the Participating Organization shall promptly forward to 
NYSE Regulation, as applicable, a copy of such customer complaint.
    b. If a Participating Organization receives a copy of a customer 
complaint relating to Insider Trading or other activity or conduct that 
is within FINRA's Regulatory Responsibilities as set forth in this 
Agreement, the Participating Organization shall promptly forward to 
FINRA, as applicable, a copy of such customer complaint.
    10. Parties to Make Personnel Available as Witnesses. Each 
Participating Organization shall make its personnel available to NYSE 
Regulation or FINRA to serve as testimonial or non-testimonial 
witnesses as necessary to assist NYSE Regulation and FINRA in 
fulfilling the Regulatory Responsibilities allocated under this 
Agreement. FINRA and NYSE Regulation shall provide reasonable advance 
notice when practicable and shall work with a Participating 
Organization to accommodate reasonable scheduling conflicts within the 
context and demands as the entities with ultimate regulatory 
responsibility. The Participating Organization shall pay all reasonable 
travel and other expenses incurred by its employees to the extent that 
NYSE Regulation or FINRA require such employees to serve as witnesses, 
and provide information or other assistance pursuant to this Agreement.
    11. Market Data; Sharing of Work-Papers, Data and Related 
Information.
    a. Market Data. FINRA and NYSE Regulation shall obtain raw market 
data necessary to the performance of regulation under this Agreement 
from (a) the Consolidated Tape Association (``CTA'') as the exclusive 
securities information processor (``SIP'') for all NYSE-listed, AMEX-
listed securities, and CHX solely listed securities and (b) the NASDAQ 
Unlisted Trading Privileges Plan as the exclusive SIP for NASDAQ-listed 
securities.
    b. Sharing. A Participating Organization shall make available to 
each of NYSE Regulation and FINRA information necessary to assist NYSE 
Regulation or FINRA in fulfilling the regulatory responsibilities 
assumed under the terms of this Agreement. Such information shall 
include any information collected by an exchange or association in the 
course of performing its regulatory obligations under the Act, 
including information relating to an on-going disciplinary 
investigation or action against a member, the amount of a fine imposed 
on a member, financial information, or information regarding 
proprietary trading systems gained in the course of examining a member 
(``Regulatory Information''). This Regulatory Information shall be used 
by NYSE Regulation and FINRA solely for the purposes of fulfilling 
their respective regulatory responsibilities.
    c. No Waiver of Privilege. The sharing of documents or information 
between the parties pursuant to this Agreement shall not be deemed a 
waiver as against third parties of regulatory or other privileges 
relating to the discovery of documents or information.
    d. Intellectual Property.
    (i) Existing Intellectual Property. Each of NYSE Regulation and 
FINRA, respectively, is and will remain the owner of all right, title 
and interest in and to the proprietary Intellectual Property it employs 
in the provision of regulation hereunder (including the SONAR and Stock 
Watch systems), and any derivative works thereof. To the extent certain 
elements of either of these parties' systems, or portions thereof, may 
be licensed or leased from third parties, all such third party elements 
shall remain the property of such third parties, as applicable. 
Likewise, any other Participating Organization is and will remain the 
owner of all right, title and interest in and to its own existing 
proprietary Intellectual Property.
    (ii) Enhancements to Existing Intellectual Property or New 
Developments of NYSE Regulation or FINRA. In the event NYSE Regulation 
or FINRA (a) makes any changes, modifications or enhancements to its 
respective Intellectual Property for any reason, or (b) creates any 
newly developed Intellectual Property for any reason, including as a 
result of requested enhancements or new development by the Exchange 
Committee (collectively, the ``New IP''), the Participating 
Organizations acknowledge and agree that each of NYSE Regulation and 
FINRA shall be deemed the owner of the New IP created by each of them, 
respectively (and any derivative works thereof), and shall retain all 
right, title and interest therein and thereto, and each other 
Participating Organization hereby irrevocably assigns, transfers and 
conveys to each of NYSE Regulation and FINRA, as applicable, without 
further consideration all of its right, title and interest in or to all 
such New IP (and any derivative works thereof).
    (iii) NYSE Regulation and FINRA will not charge the Participating 
Organizations any fees for any New IP created and used by NYSE 
Regulation or FINRA, respectively; provided, however, that NYSE 
Regulation and FINRA will each be permitted to charge fees for software 
maintenance work performed on systems used in the discharge of their 
respective duties hereunder.
    12. Special or Cause Examinations. Nothing in this Agreement shall 
restrict or in any way encumber the right of a party to conduct special 
or cause examinations of Common NYSE Members or Common FINRA Members as 
any party, in its sole discretion, shall deem appropriate or necessary.
    13. Dispute Resolution Under this Agreement.
    a. Negotiation. The Parties will attempt to resolve any disputes 
through good faith negotiation and discussion, escalating such 
discussion up through the appropriate management levels until reaching 
the executive management level. In the event a dispute cannot be 
settled through these means, the Parties shall refer the dispute to 
binding arbitration.
    b. Binding Arbitration. All claims, disputes, controversies, and 
other matters in question between the Parties to this Agreement arising 
out of or relating to this Agreement or the breach thereof that cannot 
be resolved by the Parties will be resolved through binding 
arbitration. Unless otherwise agreed by the Parties, a dispute 
submitted to binding arbitration pursuant to this paragraph shall be 
resolved using the following procedures:
    (i) The arbitration shall be conducted in the city of New York in 
accordance with the Commercial Arbitration Rules of the American 
Arbitration Association and judgment upon the award rendered by the 
arbitrator may be entered in any court having jurisdiction thereof; and
    (ii) There shall be three arbitrators, and the chairperson of the 
arbitration panel shall be an attorney.
    14. Limitation of Liability. As between the Participating 
Organizations, no Participating Organization, including its respective 
directors, governors, officers, employees and agents, will be liable to 
any other Participating Organization, or its directors, governors, 
officers, employees and agents, for any liability, loss or damage 
resulting from any

[[Page 64759]]

delays, inaccuracies, errors or omissions with respect to its 
performing or failing to perform regulatory responsibilities, 
obligations, or functions, except (a) as otherwise provided for under 
the Act, (b) in instances of a Participating Organization's gross 
negligence, willful misconduct or reckless disregard with respect to 
another Participating Organization, (c) in instances of a breach of 
confidentiality obligations owed to another Participating Organization, 
or (d) in the case of any Participating Organization paying fees 
hereunder, for any payments due. The Participating Organizations 
understand and agree that the regulatory responsibilities are being 
performed on a good faith and best effort basis and no warranties, 
express or implied, are made by any Participating Organization to any 
other Participating Organization with respect to any of the 
responsibilities to be performed hereunder. This paragraph is not 
intended to create liability of any Participating Organization to any 
third party.
    15. SEC Approval.

Participating Organizations hereto, or their respective legal 
representatives, successors, and assigns, any rights, remedies, 
obligations or liabilities under or by reason of this Agreement, (b) 
constitute the Participating Organizations hereto partners or 
participants in a joint venture, or (c) appoint one Participating

other party.
    18. Severability. Any term or provision of this Agreement that is 
invalid or unenforceable in any jurisdiction shall, as to such 
jurisdiction, be ineffective to the extent of such invalidity or 
unenforceability without rendering invalid or unenforceable the 
remaining terms and provisions of this Agreement or affecting the 
validity or enforceability of any of the terms or provisions of this 
Agreement in any other jurisdiction.
    19. Termination.
    a. Any Participating Organization may cancel its participation in 
the Agreement at any time, provided that it has given 180 days written 
notice to the other Participating Organizations (or in the case of a 
change of control in ownership of a Participating Organization, such 
other notice time period as that Participating Organization may 
choose), and provided that such termination has been approved by the 
SEC. The cancellation of its participation in this Agreement by any 
Participating Organization shall not terminate this Agreement as to the 
remaining Participating Organizations.

Exhibit B: Fee Schedule

    1. Fees. NYSE Regulation and, separately, FINRA shall charge each 
Participating Organization a Quarterly Fee in arrears for the 
performance of NYSE Regulation's and FINRA's respective regulatory 
responsibilities under the Plan (each, a ``Quarterly Fee,'' and 
together, the ``Fees'').
    a. Quarterly Fees.
    (1) Quarterly Fees for each Participating Organization will be 
charged by NYSE Regulation and FINRA, respectively, according to the 
Participating Organization's ``Percentage of Publicly Reported Trades'' 
occurring over three-month billing periods. The ``Percentage of 
Publicly Reported Trades'' shall equal a Participating Organization's 
number of reported NYSE-listed trades (when billing originates from 
NYSE Regulation) and combined AMEX-listed, NASDAQ-listed, and CHX 
solely-listed trades (when billing originates from FINRA) during the 
relevant period (the ``Numerator''), divided by the total number of 
either all NYSE-listed trades or all combined AMEX-listed, NASDAQ-
listed, and CHX solelylisted trades, respectively, for the same period 
(the ``Denominator''). For purposes of clarification, ADF and Trade 
Reporting Facility (TRF) activity will be included in the Denominator. 
Additionally, with regard to TRFs, TRF trade volume will be charged to 
FINRA. Consequently, for purposes of calculating the Quarterly Fees, 
the volume for each Participant Organization's TRF will be calculated 
separately (that is, TRF volume will be broken out from the 
Participating Organization's overall Percentage of Publicly Reported 
Trades) and the fees for such will be billed to FINRA in accordance 
with paragraph 1(a)(2), rather than to the applicable Participating 
Organization.
    (2) The Quarterly Fees shall be determined by each of NYSE 
Regulation and FINRA, as applicable, in the following manner for each 
Participating Organization:
    (a) Less than 1.0%: If the Participating Organization's Percentage 
of Publicly Reported Trades for NYSE-listed trades (in the case of NYSE 
Regulation) or for combined AMEX-listed, NASDAQ-listed, and CHX 
solelylisted trades (in the case of FINRA) for the relevant three-month 
billing period is less than 1.0%, the Quarterly Fee shall be $3,125, 
per quarter (``Static Fee'');
    (b) Less than 2.0% but No Less than 1.0%: If the Participating 
Organization's Percentage of Publicly Reported Trades for NYSE-listed 
trades (in the case of NYSE Regulation) or for combined AMEX-listed, 
NASDAQ-listed, and CHX solely-listed trades (in the case of FINRA) for 
the relevant three-month billing period is less than 2.0% but no less 
than 1.0%, the Quarterly Fee shall be $9,375, per quarter (``Static 
Fee'');
    (c) 2.0% or Greater: If the Participating Organization's Percentage 
of Publicly Reported Trades for NYSE-listed trades (in the case of NYSE 
Regulation) or for combined AMEX-listed, NASDAQ-listed, and CHX solely 
listed trades (in the case of FINRA) for the relevant three-month 
billing period is 2.0% or greater, the Quarterly Fee shall be the 
amount equal to the Participating Organization's Percentage of Publicly 
Reported Trades multiplied by NYSE Regulation's or FINRA's total charge 
(``Total Charge''), respectively, for its performance of Insider 
Trading regulatory responsibilities for the relevant three-month 
billing period.
    (3) Increases in Static Fees. NYSE Regulation and FINRA will re-
evaluate the Quarterly Fees on an annual basis during the annual budget 
process outlined in paragraph 1.c. below. During each annual re-
evaluation, NYSE Regulation and FINRA will have the discretion to 
increase the Static Fees by a percentage no greater than the percentage 
increase in the Final Budget over the preceding year's Final Budget. 
Any changes to the Static Fees shall not require an amendment to this 
Agreement, but rather shall be memorialized through the Budget Process.
    (4) Increases in Total Charges. Any change in the Total Charges 
(whether a Final Budget increase or any mid year change) shall not 
require an amendment to this Agreement, but rather shall be 
memorialized through the budget process.
    b. Source of Data. For purposes of calculation of the Percentage of 
Publicly Reported Trades for each Participating Organization, NYSE 
Regulation and FINRA shall use (a) the Consolidated Tape Association 
(``CTA'') as the exclusive securities information processor (``SIP'') 
for all NYSE Listed Stocks, AMEX Listed Stocks, and CHXSolely Listed 
Stocks, and (b) the Unlisted Trading Privileges Plan as the exclusive 
SIP for NASDAQ-listed Stocks.
    c. Annual Budget Forecast. NYSE Regulation and FINRA will notify 
the Participating Organizations of the forecasted costs of their 
respective insider trading programs for the following calendar year by 
close of business on October 15 of the then-current year (the 
``Forecasted Budget''). NYSE Regulation and FINRA shall use best 
efforts to provide as accurate a forecast as possible. NYSE Regulation 
and FINRA shall then provide a final submission of the costs following 
approval of such costs by their respective governing Boards (the 
``Final Budget''). Subject to paragraph 1(d) below, in the event of a 
difference between the Forecasted Budget and the Final Budget, the 
Final Budget will govern.
    d. Increases in Fees Over Twenty Percent.
    (1) In the event that any proposed increase to Fees by NYSE 
Regulation or by FINRA for a given calendar year (which increase may 
arise either during the annual budgetary forecasting process or through 
any mid-year increase) will result in a cumulative increase in such 
calendar year's Fees of more than twenty percent (20%) above the 
preceding calendar year's Final Budget (a ``Major Increase''), then 
senior management of any Participating Organization (a) that is a 
Listing Market or (b) for which the Percentage of Publicly Reported 
Trades is then currently twenty percent (20%) or greater, shall have 
the right to call a meeting with the senior management of NYSE 
Regulation or FINRA, respectively, in order to discuss any disagreement 
over such proposed Major Increase. By way of example, if NYSE 
Regulation provides a Final Budget for 2009 that represents an 8% 
increase above the Final Budget for 2008, the terms of this paragraph 
1.d.(1) shall not apply; if, however, in April of 2009, NYSE Regulation 
notifies the Exchange Committee of an increase in Fees that represents 
an additional 14% increase above the Final Budget for 2008, then

[[Page 64762]]

the increase shall be deemed a Major Increase, and the terms of this 
paragraph 1.d.(1) shall become applicable (i.e., 8% + 14% = a 
cumulative increase of 22% above 2008 Final Budget).
    (2) In the event that senior management members of the involved 
parties are unable to reach an agreement regarding the proposed Major 
Increase, then the matter shall be referred back to the Exchange 
Committee for final resolution. Prior to the matter being referred back 
to the Exchange Committee, nothing shall prohibit the parties from 
conferring with the SEC. Resolution shall be reached through a vote of 
no fewer than all Participating Organizations seated on the Exchange 
Committee, and a simple majority shall be required in order to reject 
the proposed Major Increase.
    e. Time Tracking. NYSER and FINRA shall track the time spent by 
staff on insider trading responsibilities under this Agreement; 
however, time tracking will not be used to allocate costs.
    2. Invoicing and Payment.
    a. NYSE Regulation shall invoice each Participating Organization 
for the Quarterly Fee associated with the regulatory activities 
performed pursuant to this Agreement during the previous three-month 
billing period within forty-five (45) days of the end of such previous 
3-month billing period. A Participating Organization shall have thirty 
(30) days from date of invoice to make payment to NYSE Regulation on 
such invoice. The invoice will reflect the Participating Organization's 
Percentage of Publicly Reported Trades for that billing period.
    b. FINRA shall invoice each Participating Organization for the 
Quarterly Fee associated with the regulatory activities performed 
pursuant to this Agreement during the previous three-month billing 
period within forty-five (45) days of the end of such previous 3-month 
billing period. A Participating Organization shall have thirty (30) 
days from date of invoice to make payment to FINRA on such invoice. The 
invoice will reflect the Participating Organization's Percentage of 
Publicly Reported Trades for that billing period.
    3. Disputed Invoices; Interest. In the event that a Participating 
Organization disputes an invoice or a portion of an invoice, the 
Participating Organization shall notify in writing either FINRA or NYSE 
Regulation (each, an ``Invoicing Party''), as applicable, of the 
disputed item(s) within fifteen (15) days of receipt of the invoice. In 
its notification to the Invoicing Party of the disputed invoice, the 
Participating Organization shall identify the disputed item(s) and 
provide a brief explanation of why the Participating Organization 
disputes the charges. An Invoicing Party may charge a Participating 
Organization interest on any undisputed invoice or the undisputed 
portions of a disputed invoice that a Participating Organization fails 
to pay within thirty (30) days of its receipt of such invoice. Such 
interest shall be assessed monthly. Interest will mean one and one half 
percent per month, or the maximum allowable under applicable Law, 
whichever is less.
    4. Taxes. In the event any governmental authority deems the 
regulatory activities allocated to NYSE Regulation or FINRA to be 
taxable activities similar to the provision of services in a commercial 
context, the other Participating Organizations agree that they shall 
bear full responsibility, on a joint and several basis, for the payment 
of any such taxes levied on NYSE Regulation or FINRA, or, if such taxes 
are paid by NYSE Regulation or FINRA directly to the governmental 
authority, the other Participating Organizations agree that they shall 
reimburse NYSE Regulation and/or FINRA, as applicable, for the amount 
of any such taxes paid.
    5. Audit Right; Recordkeeping.
    a. Audit Right.
    (i) Audit of NYSE Regulation.
    (a) Once every rolling twelve (12) month period, NYSE Regulation 
shall permit no more than one audit (to be performed by one or more 
Participating Organizations) of the Fees charged by NYSE Regulation to 
the Participating Organizations hereunder and a detailed cost analysis 
supporting such Fees (the ``Audit''). The Participating Organization or 
Organizations that conduct this Audit will select a nationally 
recognized independent auditing firm (or may use its regular 
independent auditor, providing it is a nationally recognized auditing 
firm) (``Auditing Firm'') to act on its, or their behalf, and will 
provide reasonable notice to other Participating Organizations of the 
Audit and invite the other Participating Organizations to participate 
in the Audit. NYSE Regulation will permit the Auditing Firm reasonable 
access during NYSE Regulation's normal business hours--with reasonable 
advance notice, to such financial records and supporting documentation 
as are necessary to permit review of the accuracy of the calculation of 
the Fees charged to the Participating Organizations. The Participating 
Organization, or Organizations, as applicable, other than NYSE 
Regulation, shall be responsible for the costs of performing any such 
audit.
    (b) If, through an Audit, the Exchange Committee determines that 
NYSE Regulation has inaccurately calculated the Fees for any 
Participating Organization, the Exchange Committee will promptly notify 
NYSE Regulation in writing of the amount of such difference in the 
Fees, and, if applicable, NYSE Regulation shall issue a reimbursement 
of the overage amount to the relevant Participating Organization(s), 
less any amount owed by the Participating Organization under any 
outstanding, undisputed invoice(s). If such an Audit reveals that any 
Participating Organization paid less than what was required pursuant to 
the Agreement, then that Participating Organization shall promptly pay 
NYSE Regulation the difference between what the Participating 
Organization owed pursuant to the Agreement and what that Participating 
Organization originally paid NYSE Regulation. If NYSE Regulation 
disputes the results of an audit regarding the accuracy of the Fees, it 
will submit the dispute for resolution pursuant to the dispute 
resolution procedures in paragraph 13 hereof.
    (c) In the event that through the review of any supporting 
documentation provided during the Audit, any one or more Participating 
Organizations desire to discuss with NYSE Regulation the supporting 
documentation and any questions arising therefrom with regard to the 
manner in which regulation was conducted, the Participating 
Organization(s) shall call a meeting with NYSE Regulation. NYSE 
Regulation shall in turn notify the Exchange Committee of this meeting 
in advance, and all Participating Organizations shall be welcome to 
attend (the ``Fee Analysis Meeting''). The parties to this Agreement 
acknowledge and agree that while NYSE Regulation commits to discuss the 
supporting documentation at the Fee Analysis Meeting, NYSE Regulation 
shall not be subject, by virtue of the above Audit rights or any 
discussions during the Fee Analysis Meeting or otherwise, to any 
limitation whatsoever, other than the Increase in Fee provisions set 
forth in paragraph 1.d. of this Exhibit, on its discretion as to the 
manner and means by which it conducts its regulatory efforts in its 
role as the SRO primarily liable for regulatory decisions under this 
Agreement. To that end, no disagreement among the Participating 
Organizations as to the manner or means by which NYSE Regulation 
conducts its regulatory efforts hereunder shall be subject to the 
dispute resolution procedures

[[Page 64763]]

hereunder, and no Participating Organization shall have the right to 
compel NYSE Regulation to alter the manner or means by which it 
conducts its regulatory efforts. Further, a Participating Organization 
shall not have the right to compel a rebate or reassessment of fees for 
services rendered, on the basis that the Participating Organization 
would have conducted regulatory efforts in a different manner than NYSE 
Regulation in its professional judgment chose to conduct its regulatory 
efforts.
    ii. Audit of FINRA.
    (a) Once every rolling twelve (12) month period, FINRA shall permit 
no more than one audit (to be performed by one or more Participating 
Organizations) of the Fees charged by FINRA to the Participating 
Organizations hereunder and a detailed cost analysis supporting such 
Fees (the ``Audit''). The Participating Organization or Organizations 
that conduct this Audit will select a nationally recognized independent 
auditing firm (or may use its regular independent auditor, providing it 
is a nationally recognized auditing firm) (``Auditing Firm'') to act on 
its, or their behalf, and will provide reasonable notice to other 
Participating Organizations of the Audit. FINRA will permit the 
Auditing Firm reasonable access during FINRA''s normal business hours, 
with reasonable advance notice, to such financial records and 
supporting documentation as are necessary to permit review of the 
accuracy of the calculation of the Fees charged to the Participating 
Organizations. The Participating Organization, or Organizations, as 
applicable, other than FINRA, shall be responsible for the costs of 
performing any such audit.
    (b) If, through an Audit, the Exchange Committee determines that 
FINRA has inaccurately calculated the Fees for any Participating 
Organization, the Exchange Committee will promptly notify FINRA in 
writing of the amount of such difference in the Fees, and, if 
applicable, FINRA shall issue a reimbursement of the overage amount to 
the relevant Participating Organization(s), less any amount owed by the 
Participating Organization under any outstanding, undisputed 
invoice(s). If such an Audit reveals that any Participating 
Organization paid less than what was required pursuant to the 
Agreement, then that Participating Organization shall promptly pay 
FINRA the difference between what the Participating Organization owed 
pursuant to the Agreement and what that Participating Organization 
originally paid FINRA. If FINRA disputes the results of an audit 
regarding the accuracy of the Fees, it will submit the dispute for 
resolution pursuant to the dispute resolution procedures in paragraph 
13 hereof.
    (c) In the event that through the review of any supporting 
documentation provided during the Audit, any one or more Participating 
Organizations desire to discuss with FINRA the supporting documentation 
and any questions arising therefrom with regard to the manner in which 
regulation was conducted, the Participating Organization(s) shall call 
a meeting with FINRA. FINRA shall in turn notify the Exchange Committee 
of this meeting in advance, and all Participating Organizations shall 
be welcome to attend (the ``Fee Analysis Meeting''). The parties to 
this Agreement acknowledge and agree that while FINRA commits to 
discuss the supporting documentation at the Fee Analysis Meeting, FINRA 
shall not be subject, by virtue of the above Audit rights or any 
discussions during the Fee Analysis Meeting or otherwise, to any 
limitation whatsoever, other than the Increase in Fee provisions set 
forth in paragraph 1.d. of this Exhibit, on its discretion as to the 
manner and means by which it conducts its regulatory efforts in its 
role as the SRO primarily liable for regulatory decisions under this 
Agreement. To that end, no disagreement among the Participating 
Organizations as to the manner or means by which FINRA conducts its 
regulatory efforts hereunder shall be subject to the dispute resolution 
procedures hereunder, and no Participating Organization shall have the 
right to compel FINRA to alter the manner or means by which it conducts 
its regulatory efforts. Further, a Participating Organization shall not 
have the right to compel a rebate or reassessment of fees for services 
rendered, on the basis that the Participating Organization would have 
conducted regulatory efforts in a different manner than FINRA in its 
professional judgment chose to conduct its regulatory efforts.
    b. Recordkeeping. In anticipation of any audit that may be 
performed by the Exchange Committee under paragraph 5.a. above, NYSE 
and FINRA shall each keep accurate financial records and documentation 
relating to the Fees charged by each, respectively, under this 
Agreement.

V. Discussion

    The Commission finds that the Plan, as proposed to be amended, is

[[Page 64765]]

consistent with the factors set forth in Section 17(d) of the Act \15\ 
and Rule 17d-2\16\ thereunder in that it is necessary or appropriate in 
the public interest and for the protection of investors, fosters 
cooperation and coordination among SROs, and removes impediments to and 
fosters the development of the national market system. The Commission 
continues to believe that the Plan, as proposed to be amended, should 
reduce unnecessary regulatory duplication by allocating regulatory 
responsibility for the surveillance, investigation, and enforcement of 
Common Rules over Common NYSE Members, with respect to NYSE-listed 
stocks and NYSE Arca listed stocks, to NYSE and over Common FINRA 
Members, with respect to NASDAQ-listed stocks, Amex-listed stocks, and 
any CHX solely-listed stock, to FINRA. Accordingly, the proposed 
amendment to the Plan promotes efficiency by consolidating these 
regulatory functions in a single SRO based on the listing market for a 
stock, with regard to Common NYSE Members and Common FINRA Members.
    Under paragraph (c) of Rule 17d-2, the Commission may, after 
appropriate notice and comment, declare a plan, or any part of a plan, 
effective. In this instance, the Commission believes that appropriate 
notice and comment can take place after the proposed amendment is 
effective. The purpose of the amendment is to add BYX as an SRO 
participant to the Plan. By declaring effective the amended Plan today, 
BYX can be included in the Plan prior to beginning operations as a 
national securities exchange and the amended Plan can become effective 
and be implemented without undue delay. In addition, the Commission 
believes it is appropriate to remove references to ISE from the Plan as 
ISE is no longer a Participating Organization. Finally, the Commission 
believes that the technical corrections to update the names of certain 
Participating Organizations is appropriate and consistent with the Act. 
In addition, the Commission notes that the prior version of this Plan 
was published for comment, and the Commission did not receive any 
comments thereon.\17\ Finally, the Commission does not believe that the 
amendment to the Plan raises any new regulatory issues that the 
Commission has not previously considered.

VI. Conclusion

    This order gives effect to the amended Plan submitted to the 
Commission that is contained in File No. 4-566.
    It is therefore ordered, pursuant to Section 17(d) of the Act,\18\ 
that the Plan, as amended, is hereby approved and declared effective.

    It is further ordered that the Participating Organizations are 
relieved of those regulatory responsibilities allocated to NYSE and 
FINRA under the amended Plan to the extent of such allocation.

    For the Commission, by the Division of Trading and Markets, 
pursuant to delegated authority.\19\
