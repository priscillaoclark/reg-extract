    On October 14, 2019, OFAC issued GLs 1, 2, and 3 to authorize

13894 of October 14, 2019 ``Blocking Property and Suspending Entry of 
Certain Persons Contributing to the Situation in Syria'' (84 FR 55851, 
October 17, 2019). In 2020, E.O. 13894 was incorporated into the Syria-
Related Sanctions Regulations, 31 CFR part 569 (``Regulations''). GLs 2 
and 3 were revoked on November 5, 2019. Each GL was made available on 
OFAC's website (<a href="https://ofac.treasury.gov">https://ofac.treasury.gov</a>) when it was issued. In 2022, 
OFAC added GLs for the official business of the U.S. government and for 
official business of certain international organizations and entities 
at Sec. Sec.  569.509 and 569 of the Regulations, respectively, which 
incorporate the authorizations previously in GLs 1 and 3. The text of
