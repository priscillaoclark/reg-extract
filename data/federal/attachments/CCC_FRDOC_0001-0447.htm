Domestic Sugar Program--FY 2024 Reassignment and FY25 Overall 
Sugar Marketing Allotment, Cane Sugar and Beet Sugar Marketing 
Allotments and Company Allocations

AGENCY: Commodity Credit Corporation, Department of Agriculture.

ACTION: Notice.

-----------------------------------------------------------------------

SUMMARY: The United States Department of Agriculture (USDA) is issuing 
this notice to: revise fiscal year (FY) 2024 (crop year 2023) State 
cane sugar allotments and allocations to sugarcane processors; reassign 
FY 2024 cane sugar marketing allocations to raw cane sugar imports 
already anticipated; and announce the FY 2025 (crop year 2024) overall 
sugar marketing allotment quantity (OAQ), State cane sugar allotments, 
and sugar beet and sugarcane processor allocations. The first two 
actions apply to all domestic cane sugar marketed for human consumption 
in the United States from October 1, 2023, through September 30, 2024, 
and third action applies to all domestic beet and cane sugar marketed 
for human consumption in the United States from October 1, 2024, 
through September 30, 2025.

SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION:

Revisions and Reassignments of FY 2024 Sugar Cane Allotments and 
Allocations

    On October 13, 2023, USDA announced the initial FY 2024 OAQ, which 
was established at 10,667,500 short tons, raw value, (STRV) equal to 85 
percent of the estimated quantity of sugar for domestic human 
consumption for the fiscal year of 12,550,000 STRV as forecast in the 
September 2023 World Agricultural Supply and Demand Estimates report 
(WASDE). The Agricultural Adjustment Act of 1938

[[Page 79502]]

(Pub. L. 75-430, 7 U.S.C. chapter 35) requires that 54.35 percent of 
the OAQ be distributed among beet processors and 45.65 percent be 
distributed among the sugarcane States and cane processors. The beet 
and cane sector allotments were distributed to individual processors 
according to statutory formulas.
    On August 2, 2024, USDA announced revisions to the FY 2024 (crop 
year 2023) State cane sugar allotments and allocations to sugarcane 
processors, revisions to the company allocations to sugar beet 
processors, and the reassignment of deficits to raw cane sugar imports 
already anticipated, as reflected in the second column of the Table 1 
in the published notice (89 FR 63157-63159).
    In accordance with section 359e of the Agricultural Adjustment Act 
of 1938 (7 U.S.C. 1359ee), after evaluating each sugarcane processor's 
ability to market its full allocation, USDA now is transferring FY 2024 
allocations from sugarcane processors with surplus allocation to those 
with deficit allocation as shown in the Table 1 below. USDA has also 
determined that domestic cane sugar supplies are inadequate to fill the 
FY 2024 cane sugar marketing allotment.
    In accordance with 7 U.S.C. 1359ee(b)(2), USDA is reassigning 
40,000 STRV of the deficit to raw cane sugar imports already 
anticipated, given the absence of any Commodity Credit Corporation 
(CCC) stocks of sugar. In the table below, each sugar cane processor's 
allocation resulting from these changes are shown in the column labeled 
as ``Revised Allocations & Allotments'' and the amount of change in 
each cane processor's allocation in the column labeled as 
``Reassignments.''
    USDA is not reassigning any FY 2024 beet allocations to raw cane 
sugar imports at this time given the uncertainty about how much beet 
sugar will be produced from new crop sugar beets in the final 2 months 
(August-September) of FY 2024.

FY 2025 Overall Sugar Marketing Allotment, Cane Sugar and Beet Sugar 
Marketing Allotments, and Company Allocations

    The Agricultural Adjustment Act of 1938, as amended, requires USDA 
to establish the OAQ at a quantity not less than 85 percent of the 
estimated quantity of sugar for domestic human consumption for the crop 
year. USDA is establishing the initial FY 2025 (crop year 2024) OAQ at 
10,455,000 STRV, equal to 85 percent of 12,300,000 STRV, the estimated 
quantity of sugar for domestic human consumption for FY 2025 as 
forecast in the September 2024 WASDE. Per the Agricultural Adjustment 
Act of 1938, as amended, 54.35 percent of the OAQ is distributed among 
beet processors and 45.65 percent is distributed among the sugarcane 
States and cane processors, with the beet and cane sector allotments 
distributed to individual processors according to formulas set out in 
law.\1\ Although the Agricultural Adjustment Act of 1938, as amended, 
directs USDA to assign 325,000 STRV of the cane sector allotment to 
``offshore States,'' CCC has determined that while sugarcane was 
formerly produced in Puerto Rico and Hawaii, both have permanently 
exited sugarcane production. As a result, CCC has allocated the 325,000 
STRV of the cane sector allotment previously reserved for offshore 
States to the mainland sugarcane producing States. Additionally, 
because no sugarcane crop is estimated to be produced in Texas during 
FY 2025 (crop year 2024), CCC is immediately reassigning the Texas 
portion of the mainland sugarcane allotment, 222,999 STRV, to the other 
mainland sugarcane producing states on a proportional basis as follows: 
125,732 STRV to Florida and 97,267 STRV to Louisiana. The initial FY 
2025 sugar marketing State allotments and processor allocations, are 
listed in the table below.
