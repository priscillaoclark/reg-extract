SECURITIES AND EXCHANGE COMMISSION

 
Submission for OMB Review; Comment Request

Upon Written Request, Copies Available From: Securities and Exchange 
Commission, Office of Investor Education and Advocacy, Washington, DC 
20549-0213.

Extension:
    Rule 203-2 and Form ADV-W; SEC File No. 270-40; OMB Control No. 
3235-0313.

    Notice is hereby given that, pursuant to the Paperwork Reduction 
Act of 1995 (44 U.S.C. 3501 et seq.), the Securities and Exchange 
Commission (``Commission'') has submitted to the Office of Management 
and Budget (``OMB'') a request for extension of the previously approved 
collection of information discussed below.
    The title for the collection of information is ``Rule 203-2 (17 CFR 
275.203-2) and Form ADV-W (17 CFR 279.2) under the Investment Advisers 
Act of 1940 (15 U.S.C. 80b).'' Rule 203-2 under the Investment Advisers 
Act of 1940 establishes procedures for an investment adviser to 
withdraw its registration with the Commission. Rule 203-2 requires 
every person withdrawing from investment adviser registration with the 
Commission to file Form ADV-W electronically on the Investment Adviser 
Registration Depository (``IARD''). The purpose of the information 
collection is to notify the Commission and the public when an 
investment adviser withdraws its pending or approved SEC registration. 
Typically, an investment adviser files a Form ADV-W when it ceases 
doing business or when it is ineligible to remain registered with the 
Commission.
    The potential respondents to this information collection are all 
investment advisers registered with the Commission. The Commission has 
estimated that compliance with the requirement to complete Form ADV-W 
imposes a total burden of approximately 0.75 hours (45 minutes) for an 
adviser filing for full withdrawal and approximately 0.25 hours (15 
minutes) for an adviser filing for partial withdrawal. Based on 
historical filings, the Commission estimates that there are 
approximately 500 respondents annually filing for full withdrawal and 
approximately 500 respondents annually filing for partial withdrawal. 
Based on these estimates, the total estimated annual burden would be 
500 hours ((500 respondents x .75 hours) + (500 respondents x .25 
hours)).
    Rule 203-2 and Form ADV-W do not require recordkeeping or records 
retention. The collection of information requirements under the rule 
and form are mandatory. The information collected pursuant to the rule 
and Form ADV-W are filings with the Commission. These filings are not 
kept confidential. An agency may not conduct or sponsor, and a person 
is not required to respond to, a collection of information unless it 
displays a currently valid control number.
    Please direct general comments regarding the above information to 
the following persons: (i) Desk Office for the Securities and Exchange 
Commission, Officer of Management and Budget, Room 10102, New Executive 
Office Building, Washington, DC 20503 or send an email to: Shagufta 
Ahmed at <A HREF="mailto:Shagufta_Ahmed@omb.eop.gov">Shagufta_Ahmed@omb.eop.gov</A>; and (ii) Jeff Heslop, Acting 
Director/CIO, Securities and Exchange Commission, C/O Remi Pavlik-
Simon, 6432 General Green Way, Alexandria, VA 22312; or send an e-mail 
to: <A HREF="mailto:PRA_Mailbox@sec.gov">PRA_Mailbox@sec.gov</A>. Comments must be submitted to OMB within 30 
days of this notice.

    Dated: September 20, 2010.
Florence E. Harmon,
Deputy Secretary.
