SECURITIES AND EXCHANGE COMMISSION

[SEC File No. 270-072, OMB Control No. 3235-0076]


Proposed Collection; Comment Request; Extension: Regulation D 
(Form D)

Upon Written Request Copies Available From: Securities and Exchange 
Commission, Office of FOIA Services, 100 F Street NE, Washington, DC 
20549-2736.

    Notice is hereby given that, pursuant to the Paperwork Reduction 
Act of 1995 (44 U.S.C. 3501 et seq.), the Securities and Exchange 
Commission (``Commission'') is soliciting comments on the collection of 
information summarized below. The Commission plans to submit this 
existing collection of information to the Office of Management and 
Budget for extension and approval.
    Form D (17 CFR 239.500) is a notice of sales filed by issuers 
making an offering of securities in reliance on an exemption under 
Regulation D (17 CFR 230.501 et seq.) or Section 4(a)(5) of the 
Securities Act of 1933 (15 U.S.C. 77d(a)(5)). Regulation D sets forth 
rules governing the limited offer and sale of securities without 
Securities Act registration. The purpose of Form D is to collect 
empirical data, which provides a continuing basis for action by the 
Commission either in terms of amending existing rules and regulations 
or proposing new ones. In addition, the Form D allows the Commission to 
elicit information necessary in assessing the effectiveness of 
Regulation D (17 CFR 230.501 et seq.) and Section 4(6) of the 
Securities Act of 1933 (15 U.S.C. 77d(6)) as capital-raising devices 
for all businesses. Approximately 38,735 issuers file Form D and it 
takes approximately 5 hours per response. We estimate that 25% of 5 
hours per response (1.25 hour per response) is prepared by the issuer 
for an annual reporting burden 48,419 hours (1.25 hour per response x 
38,735 responses).
    Written comments are invited on: (a) whether this proposed 
collection of information is necessary for the proper performance of 
the functions of the agency, including whether the information will 
have practical utility; (b) the accuracy of the agency's estimate of 
the burden imposed by the collection of information; (c) ways to 
enhance the quality, utility, and clarity of the information collected; 
and (d) ways to minimize the burden of the collection of information on 
respondents, including through the use of automated collection 
techniques or other forms of information technology. Consideration will 
be given to comments and suggestions submitted in writing within 60 
days of this publication by April 15, 2024.
    An agency may not conduct or sponsor, and a person is not required 
to respond to, a collection of information unless it displays a 
currently valid control number.
    Please direct your written comment to David Bottom, Director/Chief 
Information Officer, Securities and Exchange Commission, c/o John 
Pezzullo, 100 F Street NE, Washington,
