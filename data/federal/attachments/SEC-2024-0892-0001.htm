SECURITIES AND EXCHANGE COMMISSION

[Release Nos. 34-100451; File Nos. PCAOB-2024-01, PCAOB-2024-02]


Public Company Accounting Oversight Board; Extension of Comment 
and Approval Periods for Proposed Rules on General Responsibilities of 
the Auditor in Conducting an Audit and Amendments to PCAOB Standards 
and A Firm's System of Quality Control and Related Amendments to PCAOB 
Standards

July 1, 2024.
    On June 5, 2024, the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board 
(``PCAOB'') filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission 
(``Commission''), pursuant to section 19(b)(1) of the Securities 
Exchange Act of 1934 (``Act'') \1\ and Rule 19b-4 thereunder,\2\ the 
proposed rules referenced above (collectively, the ``proposed rules''). 
The proposed rules were published for comment in the Federal Register 
on June 11, 2024.\3\ The Commission provided a 21-day public comment 
period for the proposed rules,\4\ which is scheduled to end on July 2, 
2024.
---------------------------------------------------------------------------

    \1\ 15 U.S.C. 78s(b)(1).
    \2\ 17 CFR 240.19b-4.
    \3\ See Securities Exchange Act Release Nos. 34-100276 and 34-
100277 (June 5, 2024) [89 FR 49730 and 89 FR 49588 (June 11, 2024)].
    \4\ See id.
---------------------------------------------------------------------------

    Section 19(b)(2) of the Act \5\ provides that no later than 45 days 
after the date of the publication of notice of the filing of a proposed 
rule change, or within such longer period up to 90 days as the 
Commission may designate if it finds such longer period to be 
appropriate and publishes its reasons for so finding or as to which the 
self-regulatory organization \6\ consents, the Commission shall either 
approve or disapprove the proposed rule change, or institute 
proceedings to determine whether the proposed rule change should be 
disapproved. The 45th day after publication of the notice for the 
proposed rules is July 26, 2024.
---------------------------------------------------------------------------

    \5\ 15 U.S.C. 78s(b)(2).
    \6\ The term ``self-regulatory organization'' includes a 
``registered securities association.'' See section 3(a)(26) of the 
Act. Section 107(b)(4) of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act of 2002 states that 
the provisions of section 19(b)(1)-(3) of the Act shall govern the 
proposed rules of the PCAOB as fully as if the PCAOB were a 
registered securities association for purposes of that Section.
---------------------------------------------------------------------------

    To provide additional time for public comment on the proposed rules 
and the issues raised therein, the Commission has determined to extend 
the comment period for the proposed rules for an additional 14 days. To 
accommodate the longer comment period and consideration of such 
comments, the Commission finds it appropriate to also extend the time 
period within which the Commission must take action on the proposed 
rules for up to 30 days. Accordingly, the Commission is extending the 
public comment period until July 16, 2024, and, pursuant to section 
19(b)(2) of the Act,\7\ extends the date by which the Commission shall 
either approve or disapprove, or institute proceedings to determine 
whether to disapprove, the proposed rules to August 25, 2024 (File Nos. 
PCAOB-2024-01, PCAOB-2024-02).
---------------------------------------------------------------------------

    \7\ 15 U.S.C. 78s(b)(2).

    For the Commission, by the Office of the Chief Accountant.
Vanessa A. Countryman,
Secretary.
