SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION:
    Title: CCC Facility Guarantee Program (FGP).
    OMB Number: 0551-0032.
    Expiration Date of Approval: November 30, 2022.
    Type of Request: Extension of a currently approved information 
collection.
    Abstract: Under the FGP, CCC provides payment guarantees to 
facilitate the financing of manufactured goods and U.S. services to 
improve or establish agriculture-related facilities in emerging 
markets. By supporting such goods and services exports, the FGP is 
designed to enhance sales of U.S. agricultural commodities and products 
to emerging markets where the demand for such commodities and products 
may be limited due to inadequate storage, processing, handling, or 
distribution capabilities for such products.
    The FGP is currently available in 84 countries. Under 7 CFR part 
1493, U.S. sellers, foreign financial institutions (FFI), and U.S. 
financial institutions (USFI) are required to submit the following: (1) 
information about the seller, FFI, and USFI for program

participation; (2) applications for payment guarantees; (3) 
environmental impact statement/assessment; (4) notice of assignment of 
payment guarantee; (5) evidence of performance; (6) notice of default 
and claims for loss; and (7) documents supporting dispute resolution 
and appeals. In addition, each seller and seller's assignee (U.S. 
financial institution) must maintain records on all information 
submitted to CCC and in connection with sales made under FGP. The 
information collected is used by CCC to manage, plan, evaluate, and 
account for government resources. The reports and records are required 
to ensure the proper and judicious use of public funds.
    Estimate of Burden: The public reporting burden for these 
collections is estimated to average 1.282 hours per response.
    Type of Respondents: U.S. exporters (sellers), U.S. financial 
institutions, and foreign financial institutions.
    Estimated Number of Respondents: 18 per year.
    Estimated Number of Responses per Respondent: 15.6 per year.
    Estimated Total Annual Burden of Respondents: 360.5 hours.

proposed collection of information is necessary for the proper 
performance of the functions of the agency, including whether the 
information will have practical utility; (b) the accuracy of the 
agency's estimate of the burden of the collection of information
