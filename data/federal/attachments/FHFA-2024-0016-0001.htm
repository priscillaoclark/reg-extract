Notice of Committee Charter Renewal and Objectives and Duties of the 
Committee

    Pursuant to the FACA (5 U.S.C. chapter 10), FHFA announces the 
renewal of the charter of the Committee.
    The purpose of the Committee is to advise FHFA in the exercise of 
its oversight functions regarding affordable, equitable, and 
sustainable housing, including but not limited to, affordable, 
equitable, and sustainable housing needs, barriers to access, barriers 
to long-term sustainability, and any regulatory, guidance, or policy 
changes that may be necessary or beneficial to expand such housing. The 
Committee will focus on FHFA's regulated entities--Fannie Mae, Freddie 
Mac, and the Federal Home Loan Banks--and their respective roles in 
providing a reliable source of liquidity and funding to support housing 
finance and community investment in the single-family and multifamily 
housing markets.
    The duties of the Committee are solely advisory and extend only to 
its submission of advice and recommendations to FHFA, with supporting 
information and analysis, which are non-binding on FHFA.
    No determinations of fact or policy are be made by the Committee. 
The Committee has no decision-making role, and will have no access to 
non-public FHFA information, including confidential supervisory or 
other confidential information.

Membership of the Committee

    The FHFA Director will continue to appoint the members of the 
Committee as their terms expire. To achieve a fairly balanced 
membership, FHFA will continue to seek members representative of 
diverse communities, points of view, institution asset sizes, and 
geographical locations, with expertise in affordable, sustainable, or 
equitable housing in single-family and multifamily housing. The 
Committee will include members with expertise, applicable to Fannie 
Mae, Freddie Mac, or the Federal Home Loan Banks, in the areas related 
to the duties and authorities of the Committee, such as: (1) fair 
lending, fair housing, or civil rights; (2) single-family lending, 
servicing, development, mortgages, or capital markets; (3) multifamily 
lending, servicing, development, mortgages, capital markets, or 
investments (i.e. Low-Income Housing Tax Credits); (4) consumer, 
tenant, or community advocacy; (5) housing market technology; (6) 
state, local, or tribal government housing policies and programs; and 
(7) academic or non-academic affiliated housing research.
    The Committee consists of approximately 20 members, serving two-
year terms. Members serve at the sole discretion of the Director.
    The Committee will meet regularly, as required to carry out its 
functions. It is estimated that the Committee will meet at least twice 
per year. Generally, Committee meetings will be open to the public.

Sandra L. Thompson,
Director, Federal Housing Finance Agency.
