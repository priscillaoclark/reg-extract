[Release Nos. 34-99778; IC-35157; File No. S7-21-21]


Share Repurchase Disclosure Modernization

AGENCY: Securities and Exchange Commission.

ACTION: Final rule; technical amendments.

-----------------------------------------------------------------------

SUMMARY: The Securities and Exchange Commission (``Commission'') is 
adopting technical amendments to various rules and forms under the 
Securities Exchange Act of 1934 (``Exchange Act'') and the Investment 
Company Act of 1940 (``Investment Company Act'') to reflect a Federal 
court's vacatur of rule amendments that the Commission adopted on May 
3, 2023, to modernize and improve disclosure about repurchases of an 
issuer's equity securities that are registered under the Exchange Act 
(``Repurchase Rule''). The court's vacatur of the Repurchase Rule was 
effective as of December 19, 2023, and had the legal effect of 
reverting to the rules and forms that existed prior to the effective 
date of the Repurchase Rule. These technical amendments revise the Code 
of Federal Regulations (``CFR'') to reflect the court's vacatur of the 
Repurchase Rule.

DATES: This rule is effective April 8, 2024. The Federal court's 
vacatur of the rule amendments was applicable as of December 19, 2023.

of Rulemaking, at (202) 551-3430, Division of Corporation Finance; and,

I. Background
---------------------------------------------------------------------------

    \1\ 15 U.S.C. 78a et seq.
---------------------------------------------------------------------------

    On May 3, 2023, the Commission adopted the Repurchase Rule, which 
modernized and improved disclosures about repurchases of an issuer's 
equity securities that are registered under the Exchange Act, and it 
became effective on July 31, 2023.\2\ On December 19, 2023, the U.S. 
Court of Appeals for the Fifth Circuit vacated the Repurchase Rule.\3\ 
The court's vacatur of the Repurchase Rule was effective as of December 
19, 2023 and had the legal effect of reverting to the rules and forms 
that existed prior to the effective date of the Repurchase Rule. These 
technical amendments reflect the vacatur in the CFR by rescinding the 
changes to the rules and forms promulgated under the Exchange Act and 
the Investment Company Act, including the addition of new Form F-SR, 
that were implemented under the now vacated Repurchase Rule. The text 
of Forms 20-F, 10-Q, 10-K, and N-CSR do not appear in the CFR.\4\

court's order vacated new Form F-SR.
---------------------------------------------------------------------------

II. Procedural and Other Matters

    The Administrative Procedure Act (``APA'') generally requires an 
agency to publish notice of a rulemaking in the Federal Register and 
provide an opportunity for public comment. This requirement does not 
apply, however, if the agency ``for good cause finds . . . that notice 
and public procedure are impracticable, unnecessary, or contrary to the 
public interest.'' \5\
---------------------------------------------------------------------------

    \5\ 5 U.S.C. 553(b)(3)(B).
---------------------------------------------------------------------------

    The technical amendments do not impose any new substantive 
regulatory requirements on any person and merely reflect the vacatur of 
the Repurchase Rule. For these reasons, for good cause, the Commission 
finds that notice and public comment are unnecessary.\6\
---------------------------------------------------------------------------

    \6\ This finding also satisfies the requirements of 5 U.S.C. 
808(2), allowing the amendments to become effective notwithstanding 
the requirement of 5 U.S.C. 801 (if a federal agency finds that 
notice and public comment are impractical, unnecessary or contrary 
to the public interest, a rule shall take effect at such time as the 
federal agency promulgating the rule determines). The amendments 
also do not require analysis under the Regulatory Flexibility Act. 
See 5 U.S.C. 604(a) (requiring a final regulatory flexibility 
analysis only for rules required by the APA or other law to undergo 
notice and comment).
---------------------------------------------------------------------------

    For similar reasons, although the APA generally requires 
publication of a rule at least 30 days before its effective date, the 
Commission finds there is good cause for the amendments to take effect 
on April 8, 2024.\7\
---------------------------------------------------------------------------

    \7\ See 5 U.S.C. 553(d)(3).
---------------------------------------------------------------------------

    Pursuant to the Congressional Review Act, the Office of Information 
and Regulatory Affairs has designated these amendments not a ``major 
rule,'' as defined by 5 U.S.C. 804(2).

Statutory Authority

    The amendments contained in this release are being adopted under 
the authority set forth in sections 12, 13, 15, and 23(a) of the
