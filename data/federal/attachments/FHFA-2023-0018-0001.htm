SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION:

Committee Objectives

    In accordance with the Federal Advisory Committee Act (FACA) (5 
U.S.C. 10), FHFA has established the Advisory Committee on Affordable, 
Equitable, and Sustainable Housing (Committee). The Committee will 
provide advice and input regarding affordable, equitable, and 
sustainable housing needs, barriers to access, barriers to long-term 
sustainability, and any regulations, guidance, or policy changes that 
may be necessary to expand affordable, equitable, and sustainable 
housing. The Committee will better position FHFA to fulfill its 
strategic goal of supporting access to affordable, equitable, and 
sustainable housing. These interests will focus on FHFA's regulated 
entities--Fannie Mae, Freddie Mac, and the Federal Home Loan Banks--and 
their respective roles

[[Page 62784]]

in providing liquidity and funding to support housing finance in the 
single-family and multifamily housing markets.
    For more information about the Committee, visit <a href="https://www.fhfa.gov/PolicyProgramsResearch/Programs/Pages/Fed-Adv-Committee-AES-Housing.aspx">https://www.fhfa.gov/PolicyProgramsResearch/Programs/Pages/Fed-Adv-Committee-AES-Housing.aspx</a>.

Membership

    The Committee will consist of approximately 20 members, serving 
two-year terms which may be extended at the discretion of the Agency. 
Members will serve at the sole discretion of the Director.
    To achieve a fairly balanced membership, FHFA will seek members 
representative of diverse communities, points of view, organizational 
size, and geographical location with expertise in affordable, 
sustainable, or equitable housing in single-family and multifamily 
housing. The Committee will include members with expertise in at least 
one of the seven areas related to duties of the Committee:
    1. Fair lending, fair housing, or civil rights;
    2. Single-family lending, servicing, development, mortgages, or 
capital markets;
    3. Multifamily lending, servicing, development, mortgages, capital 
markets, or investments (e.g., Low-Income Housing Tax Credits);
    4. Consumer, tenant, or community advocacy;
    5. Housing market technology;
    6. State, local, or tribal government housing policies and 
programs; and
    7. Academic or non-academic affiliated housing research.
    The Committee may also include special government employees (SGEs) 
and representative members. Membership balance is not static and may 
change to reflect the current work of the Committee. When selected, 
SGEs serve as special subject matter experts and provide their own 
personal and independent judgement, in a manner that is free from any 
conflict of interest as determined by law and regulation.
    Representative members gather and synthesize information and 
present the views of stakeholders they represent. Representatives do 
not provide their own personal views and independent advice based on 
their own individual expertise and experience. The Committee membership 
shall not include Fannie Mae, Freddie Mac, or any of the Federal Home 
Loan Banks (or any of their respective current officers, employees, or 
board members).

Responsibilities and Limitations

    The duties of the Committee are solely advisory and shall extend 
only to its submission of advice and recommendations to FHFA (within 
the scope of the Committee's activities as defined in the Charter) 
which will be non-binding on FHFA.
    No determination of fact or policy will be made by the Committee. 
The Committee will have no decision-making role and will have no access 
to non-public FHFA information, to include confidential supervisory, 
controlled unclassified, or other confidential information.
    While members of the Committee serve without compensation, FHFA may 
(at its sole discretion) reimburse them for travel expenses, including 
per diem in lieu of subsistence, for travel away from their homes or 
regular places of business in performance of Committee service (see 5 
U.S.C. 5703).
    The Committee will meet at such intervals as are required to carry 
out its functions. It is estimated that the Committee will meet at 
least twice per year. Generally, Committee meetings are open to the 
public.
