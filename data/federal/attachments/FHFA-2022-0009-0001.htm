II. Introduction

    This notice informs the public of FHFA's proposal to establish and 
maintain a new system of records. This notice satisfies the Privacy 
Act's requirement that an agency publish a system of records notice in 
the Federal Register when establishing a new or making a significant 
change to an agency's system of records. Congress has recognized that 
application of all requirements of the Privacy Act to certain 
categories of records may have an undesirable and often unacceptable 
effect upon agencies in the conduct of necessary public business. 
Consequently, Congress established general exemptions and specific 
exemptions that can be used to exempt records from provisions of the 
Privacy Act. Congress also mandates that exempting records from 
provisions of the Privacy Act requires the head of an agency to publish 
a determination to exempt a record from the Privacy Act in accordance 
with the Administrative Procedure Act. Records and information in this 
system of records are not exempt from the requirements of the Privacy 
Act.
    As required by the Privacy Act, 5 U.S.C. 552a(r), and pursuant to 
section

[[Page 30948]]

7 of OMB Circular No. A-108, Federal Agency Responsibilities for 
Review, Reporting, and Publication under the Privacy Act, (81 FR 94424 
(Dec. 23, 2016)), prior to publication of this notice, FHFA submitted a 
report describing the system of records covered by this notice to the 
OMB, the Committee on Oversight and Government Reform of the House of 
Representatives, and the Committee on Homeland Security and 
Governmental Affairs of the Senate.
    The proposed new system of records described above is set forth in

3209, Federal Housing Finance Agency, 400 Seventh Street SW, 
Washington, DC 20219, and any alternate work site utilized by employees

Enterprises Financial Safety and Soundness Act (Safety and Soundness

system is being established by FHFA to store, maintain, and analyze 
information for fair lending oversight of the Federal National Mortgage 
Association (Fannie Mae) and the Federal Home Loan Mortgage Corporation 
(Freddie Mac). The system will be used to analyze compliance with the 
Fair Housing Act, the Equal Credit Opportunity Act, and the Safety and 
Soundness Act.
    The system will also be used to share information with federal 
agencies for fair lending and fair housing research, investigation, 
supervision, and enforcement.

CATEGORIES OF INDIVIDUALS COVERED BY THE SYSTEM:
    Borrowers of Fannie Mae or Freddie Mac mortgages, applicants for 
mortgages reported pursuant to the Home Mortgage Disclosure Act, 
applicants for mortgages that have been reviewed by Fannie Mae and 
Freddie Mac's automated underwriting system, individuals involved in 
activities being reviewed for fair lending purposes, appraisers 
providing appraisals to Fannie Mae or Freddie Mac, and individuals 
making complaints related to fair lending.

CATEGORIES OF RECORDS IN THE SYSTEM:
    Records maintained in the system may include but are not limited 
to: (1) Borrower and loan characteristics such as credit score, closing 
costs, interest rates, income, race, ethnicity, age, gender, debt 
ratio, and loan amount; (2) loan transactions including mortgage loan 
originator identification numbers, origination lender identifiers, and 
seller identifiers; (3) loan payment history; (4) property 
characteristics; (5) appraiser name and license number; (6) multifamily 
property transactions including information about parties involved in 
the transaction such as name, property address, and transaction 
underwriting characteristics; and (7) real-estate owner property 
information such as appraised values, condition, repair status, and 
property address.

RECORD SOURCE CATEGORIES:
    Records in the system are obtained from the Federal Home Loan 
Banks, United States Department of Housing and Urban Development, 
Consumer Financial Protection Bureau, FHFA systems, Fannie Mae, and 
Freddie Mac.

ROUTINE USES OF RECORDS MAINTAINED IN THE SYSTEM, INCLUDING CATEGORIES 
OF USERS AND THE PURPOSES OF SUCH USES:
    In addition to those disclosures generally permitted under 5 U.S.C. 
552a(b) of the Privacy Act, these records or information contained 
therein may specifically be disclosed outside of FHFA as a routine use

(including its information systems, programs, and operations), the 
Federal Government, or national security; and (c) the disclosure is

risk of harm to individuals, the recipient agency or entity (including 
its information systems, programs, and operations), the Federal

confirmed breach.
    (3) When there is an indication of a violation or potential 
violation of law (whether civil, criminal, or regulatory in nature or 
whether arising by general statute or particular program statute or by 
regulation, rule, or order issued pursuant thereto), the relevant 
records in the system of records may be referred, as a routine use, to 
the appropriate agency (e.g., federal, state, local, tribal, foreign or

necessary at the time to the subject matter of the inquiry.
