SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION: 
    Title: Conflicts of Interest Policies and Procedures by Futures 
Commission Merchants and Introducing Brokers (OMB Control No. 3038-
0078).
    Abstract: On April 3, 2012, the Commission adopted Commission 
regulation 1.71 (Conflicts of interest policies and procedures by 
futures commission merchants and introducing brokers) \2\ pursuant to 
sections 4d(c) \3\ of the Commodity Exchange Act (``CEA'').\4\ 
Commission regulation 1.71 generally requires that, among other things, 
generally that, among other things, futures commission merchants 
(``FCM'') \5\ and introducing brokers (``IB'') \6\ develop conflicts of 
interest procedures and disclosures, adopt and implement written 
policies and procedures reasonably designed to ensure compliance with 
their conflicts of interest and disclosure obligations, and maintain 
specified records related to those requirements.\7\ The Commission 
believes that the information collection obligations imposed by 
Commission regulation 1.71 are essential to (i) ensuring that FCMs and 
IBs develop and maintain the conflicts of interest systems, procedures 
and disclosures required by the CEA, and Commission regulations, and 
(ii) the effective evaluation of these registrants' actual compliance 
with the CEA and Commission regulations.

this information collection and provided 60 days for public comment on 
the proposed extension, 87 FR 31862 (``60-Day Notice''). The Commission
