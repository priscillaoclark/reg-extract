SECURITIES AND EXCHANGE COMMISSION

[Release No. PA-62; File No. S7-2024-04]


Privacy Act of 1974; System of Records

AGENCY: Securities and Exchange Commission.

ACTION: Notice of a modified system of records.

-----------------------------------------------------------------------

SUMMARY: The Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) proposes to 
modify system of records SEC-36, Harassment Prevention and Response 
Program Records, under the Privacy Act of 1974. The system of records 
is being modified to reflect non-substantive changes to the system 
title and system manager. Minor updates to the text of the notice have 
been made throughout to be consistent with changes to the title and 
system manager. Nothing in the modified SORN changes the category of 
individuals from whom the records are collected, the collection of 
records from the individuals, the authorities, the purpose for 
collection, or the routine uses. The changes do not impact any 
individual's rights to access or to amend their records pursuant to the 
Privacy Act.

DATES: The notice will become effective upon publication, unless the 
Commission receives comments that would warrant further action.

SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION:  On October 31, 2023, the SEC published 
system of records SEC-36, Harassment Prevention and Response Program 
Records. Subsequently, the program's oversight and responsibilities 
were moved from the Office of Equal Employment Opportunity (OEEO) to 
the Office of Human Resources (OHR). As a result, OHR made updates to

and Response Program to SEC-36, Anti-Harassment Program and (b) change 
the system manager from Director, Office of Equal Employment 
Opportunity, to Chief Human Capital Officer, Office of Human Resources.

Unlawful Harassment by Supervisors (June 18, 1999).

PURPOSE(S) OF THE SYSTEM:
    The Anti-Harassment Program system of records maintains records 
regarding allegations of workplace harassment. These records are 
maintained for the purpose of conducting internal inquiries and/or 
investigations into allegations of harassment reported to the SEC by 
applicants for employment, current and former SEC employees, fellows, 
interns, or individuals who conduct business with the SEC and resolving 
allegations of workplace harassment. The records contained in this 
system do not duplicate any existing agency or government-wide system 
of records, even though some of the documents might also appear in 
other systems of records maintained for other purposes. Particularly, 
records are not collected to advance claims of discrimination pursuant 
to processes outlined in title 29 CFR part 1614. Rather, these records 
are collected for administrative action relating to allegations of 
workplace harassment, including bases found in EEO laws and elsewhere. 
The agency policy and processes govern the collection and maintenance 
of these records to further the agency's commitment to appropriately 
respond to allegations of workplace harassment.

CATEGORIES OF INDIVIDUALS COVERED BY THE SYSTEM:
    This system of records maintains information on individuals who 
have reported harassing conduct by or against SEC personnel and 
harassing conduct by or against non-SEC personnel to the program 
manager for prevention of harassment and response, in accordance with 
the agency's administrative regulation relating to harassment 
prevention and response. Individuals covered include, but are not 
limited to applicants for SEC employment, current and former SEC 
employees, fellows, interns, and individuals who conduct business with 
the SEC. Covered individuals include those who report harassment 
concerns, provide information in support of harassment inquiries or 
investigations, or are witnesses or are otherwise contacted as part of 
the fact-finding process for inquiries, investigations, and reports 
relating to workplace harassment.

CATEGORIES OF RECORDS IN THE SYSTEM:
    The system contains all records related to a report of harassment 
received by the SEC through the Anti-Harassment Program manager or 
through referrals from the Office of Equal Employment Opportunity, 
other SEC organizations necessary for the implementation of the SEC 
Anti-Harassment Program, or management officials. The records may 
include contact information of individuals involved in reports or 
allegations of harassment, statements of witnesses, exhibits, reports 
of interviews, findings and recommendations, close-out materials, 
documentation of any corrective action taken by management, and related 
correspondence. The specific data elements found in these records may 
include names, positions, social security numbers, mailing addresses, 
email addresses, employment histories, employee evaluations, 
disciplinary actions, case-related communications and notes, and audit 
logs of user access and activities within the SEC Anti-Harassment 
Program electronic databases maintained by the SEC.

RECORD SOURCE CATEGORIES:
    The SEC obtains information in this system from alleged targets of 
harassment, alleged harassers, witnesses, members of the public, other 
Federal agencies, and other individuals involved in the allegations. 
Some information, such as name of the alleged target or harasser, 
personal identification number (PIN), employee identification number, 
position, and job location may be obtained from other SEC system of 
records as relevant and necessary to carry out the SEC's function. 
Other record sources include documents related to reports of harassment 
to the SEC Anti-Harassment Program staff or management; information 
obtained through correspondence, letters, telephone calls, emails, or 
any other form of communication; data obtained from investigative 
material and any information relevant to an investigation; materials 
and information gathered by staff in the performance of their duties; 
electronic databases maintained by the staff; other SEC files; and from 
individuals, including where practicable, those to whom the records 
relate.

ROUTINE USES OF RECORDS MAINTAINED IN THE SYSTEM, INCLUDING CATEGORIES 
OF USERS AND THE PURPOSES OF SUCH USES:
    In addition to those disclosures generally permitted under 5 U.S.C.

suspects or has confirmed that there has been a breach of the system of 
records; (2) the SEC has determined that as a result of the suspected 
or confirmed breach there is a risk of harm to individuals, the SEC 
(including its information systems, programs, and operations), the 
Federal Government, or national security; and (3) the disclosure made

litigation, if the staff has reason to believe that the person to whom 
the record is disclosed may have further information about the matters 
related therein, and those matters appeared to be relevant at the time 
to the subject matter of the inquiry. Such disclosure is permitted in 
connection with civil litigation only when it is relevant and necessary 
to the litigation.

POLICIES AND PRACTICES FOR STORAGE OF RECORDS:
    Records in this system of records are stored electronically or on 
paper in secure facilities. Electronic records are stored on the SEC's 
secure network and/or an SEC-approved cloud storage location. Access to 
and use of these records is limited to those persons whose official 
duties require such access.

POLICIES AND PRACTICES FOR RETRIEVAL OF RECORDS:
    These records are cross-indexed by the name of the individual who 
reports harassment, the name of the alleged target of harassment, if 
any, and the name of the alleged harasser. The records may be retrieved 
by any of the above three indexes and other indexes, as appropriate.

POLICIES AND PRACTICES FOR RETENTION AND DISPOSAL OF RECORDS:
    These records are maintained for three years after the report of 
harassment is closed and are then deleted or destroyed in accordance 
with NARA, General Records Schedule (GRS) 023, Item 40 and the SEC 
Comprehensive Records Schedule. Authorized staff follow the SEC's 
records management procedures for safeguarding and disposing of records 
related to reports of harassment that have met their retention period.

ADMINISTRATIVE, TECHNICAL, AND PHYSICAL SAFEGUARDS:
    Access to SEC facilities, data centers, and information or 
information systems is limited to authorized personnel with official 
duties requiring access. SEC facilities are equipped with security 
cameras, and, at certain SEC facilities, 24-hour security guard 
service. Computerized records are safeguarded in a secured environment. 
Records are maintained in a secure, password-protected electronic 
system that will utilize commensurate safeguards that may include 
firewalls, intrusion detection and prevention systems, and role-based 
access controls. Additional safeguards will vary by program. All 
records are protected from unauthorized access through appropriate 
administrative, operational, and technical safeguards. These safeguards 
include restricting access to authorized personnel who have a ``need to 
know'' and using locked file cabinets and/or locked offices or file 
rooms. Contractors and other recipients providing services to the 
Commission shall be required to maintain equivalent safeguards.
