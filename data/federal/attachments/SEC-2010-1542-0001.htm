SECURITIES AND EXCHANGE COMMISSION

 
Sunshine Act Meeting

    Notice is hereby given, pursuant to the provisions of the 
Government in the Sunshine Act, Public Law 94-409, that the Securities 
and Exchange Commission will hold an Open Meeting on October 13, 2010 
at 10 a.m., in the Auditorium, Room L-002.
    The subject matter of the Open Meeting will be:
    1. The Commission will consider whether to adopt an interim final 
temporary rule under Section 766 of the Dodd-Frank Wall Street Reform 
and Consumer Protection Act, Public Law 111-203, to provide for the 
reporting of certain security-based swap transactions and including an 
interpretive note regarding retention and recordkeeping requirements 
for certain security-based swap transactions.
    2. The Commission will consider whether to propose Regulation MC 
pursuant to Section 765 of the Dodd-Frank Act to mitigate conflicts of 
interest at security-based swap clearing agencies, security-based swap 
execution facilities, and national security exchanges that post or make 
available for trading security-based swaps.
    3. The Commission will consider whether to propose rules that would 
implement Section 945 of the Dodd-Frank Wall Street Reform and Consumer 
Protection Act, which requires an issuer of asset-backed securities 
(ABS) to perform a review of the assets underlying the ABS and disclose 
information relating to the review. The Commission will also consider 
whether to propose rules that would implement Section 15E(s)(4)(A) of 
the Exchange Act as added by Section 932 of the Act, which requires an 
ABS issuer or underwriter to make publicly available the findings and 
conclusions of any third-party due diligence report.
    At times, changes in Commission priorities require alterations in 
the scheduling of meeting items.
    For further information and to ascertain what, if any, matters have 
been added, deleted or postponed, please contact: The Office of the 
Secretary at (202) 551-5400.
