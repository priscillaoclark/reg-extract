    Title: Community Development Revolving Loan Fund--Loan and Grant 
Programs, 12 CFR part 705.
    Type of Review: Extension of a previously approved collection.
    Abstract: The Fund is used to support credit unions that serve low-
income communities by providing loans and technical assistance grants 
to qualifying institutions. The programs are designed to increase 
income, ownership, and employment opportunities for low-income 
residents, and to stimulate economic growth. In addition, the programs 
provide assistance to improve the quality of services to the community 
and formulate more effective and efficient operations of credit unions. 
The information will allow NCUA to assess a credit union's capacity to 
repay the Funds and/or ensure that the funds are used as intended to 
benefit the institution and community it serves.
    Affected Public: Private Sector: Not-for-profit institutions.
    Estimated Total Annual Burden Hours: 872.

    Type of Review: Extension of a previously approved collection.
    Abstract: Part 712 of NCUA's rules and regulations regulates the 
relationship between federally insured credit unions (FICUs) and credit 
union service organizations (CUSOs). The rule requires that FICUs enter 
into a written agreement with a CUSO (prior to investing in or loaning 
money to) which stipulates the CUSO will follow general accepted 
accounting principles (GAAP); prepare quarterly financial statements; 
grant NCUA access to the CUSO books and records, and annually report 
directly to NCUA via a CUSO registry.

Section 750.6 requires requests by a troubled FICU to make a severance 
or golden parachute payment to an IAP to be submitted in writing to 
NCUA. The information will be used by the NCUA to determine whether an 
exception to the general prohibition on golden parachute payments

requires federally-insured credit unions with assets of more than $50 
million to develop, as a prerequisites for insurability of its member

to effectively implement the policy. The need for

FICU to have a written policy to establish responsibilities and 
procedures for identifying, measuring, monitoring, controlling, and 
reporting, and establishing risk limits are essential components of 
safe and sound credit union operations and to ensure the security of 
the National Credit Union Share Insurance Fund (NCUSIF).

for securitizations that do not comply with the new accounting 
standards for off balance sheet treatment by providing for expedited 
access to the financial assets that are securitized if they meet the 
conditions defined in the rule. The conditions contained in the rule 
will serve to protect the National Credit Union Share Insurance Fund 
(NCUSIF) and NCUA's interests as liquidating agent or conservator by 
aligning the conditions for the safe harbor with better and more 
sustainable lending practices by insured credit unions (FICUs).
    Affected Public: Private Sector: Not-for-profit institutions.
