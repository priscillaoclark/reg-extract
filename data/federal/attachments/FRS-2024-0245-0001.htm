Final Approval Under OMB Delegated Authority of the Extension for Three

    Collection title: Interagency Guidance on Managing Compliance and 
Reputation Risks for Reverse Mortgage Products.
    Collection identifier: FR 4029.
    OMB control number: 7100-0330.
    General description of collection: In August 2010, the Federal 
Financial Institutions Examination Council FFIEC, on behalf of its 
member agencies, published a Federal Register notice adopting 
supervisory guidance titled ``Reverse Mortgage Products: Guidance for 
Managing Compliance and Reputation Risks.'' The guidance is designed to 
assist financial institutions with risk management and efforts to 
ensure that their reverse mortgage lending practices adequately address 
consumer compliance and reputation risks. The reverse mortgage guidance 
discusses the disclosures and recordkeeping required by federal laws 
and regulations and also discusses consumer disclosures that financial 
institutions typically provide as a standard business practice. Certain 
portions of the guidance are information collections subject to PRA 
requirements and are what are included in the FR 4029.
    Frequency: Event-generated.
    Respondents: State member banks, Edge and Agreement corporations, 
bank holding companies, savings and loan holding companies, foreign 
banking organizations, and branches and agencies of foreign banks.
    Total estimated number of respondents: 5.
    Total estimated annual burden hours: 72.
    Current actions: On March 29, 2024, the Board published a notice in 
the Federal Register (89 FR 22148) requesting public comment for 60 
days on the extension, without revision, of the FR 4029. The comment 
period for this notice expired on May 28, 2024. The Board did not 
receive any comments.

    Board of Governors of the Federal Reserve System, September 25, 
2024.
Benjamin W. McDonough,
Deputy Secretary and Ombuds of the Board.
