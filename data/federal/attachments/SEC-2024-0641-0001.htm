    On March 11, 2024, Nasdaq ISE, LLC (``ISE'' or the ``Exchange'') 
filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission (``Commission''), 
pursuant to Section 19(b)(1) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 
(``Act'') \1\ and Rule 19b-4 thereunder,\2\ a proposed rule change to 
adopt rules that will govern the listing and trading of flexible 
exchange options (``FLEX Options''). The proposed rule change was 
published for comment in the Federal Register on March 29, 2024.\3\

    Section 19(b)(2) of the Act \4\ provides that, within 45 days of 
the publication of notice of the filing of a proposed rule change, or 
within such longer period up to 90 days as the Commission may designate 
if it finds such longer period to be appropriate and publishes its 
reasons for so finding, or as to which the self-regulatory organization 
consents, the Commission shall either approve the proposed rule change, 
disapprove the proposed rule change, or institute proceedings to 
determine whether the proposed rule change should be disapproved. The 
45th day after publication of the notice for this proposed rule change 
is May 13, 2024. The Commission is extending this 45-day time period.

period within which to take action on the proposed rule change so that 
it has sufficient time to consider the proposed rule change. 
Accordingly, the Commission, pursuant to Section 19(b)(2) of the 
Act,\5\ designates June 27, 2024, as the date by which the Commission 
shall either approve or disapprove, or institute proceedings to 
determine whether to disapprove, the proposed rule change (File No. SR-
ISE-2024-12).
