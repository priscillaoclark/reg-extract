Company Manual to expand the circumstances under which rights may be 
listed on the NYSE by allowing issuers to (i) issue rights to more than 
existing shareholders for a class of securities that is listed or to be 
listed on the Exchange, and (ii) list and trade rights on the Exchange 
prior to listing the security into which such rights will be 
exercisable. The proposed rule change was published for comment in the 
Federal Register on May 15, 2024.\3\ The Commission has received no
