DEPARTMENT OF THE TREASURY

Office of Foreign Assets Control

31 CFR Parts 525, 546, and 589


Adding a General License to Burma Sanctions Regulations and 
Correcting References in Sudan Stabilization and Ukraine-/Russia-
Related Sanctions Regulations

AGENCY: Office of Foreign Assets Control, Treasury.

ACTION: Final rule.

-----------------------------------------------------------------------

SUMMARY: The Department of the Treasury's Office of Foreign Assets 
Control (OFAC) is adopting a final rule to add a general license, 
update language and authorities, and correct a cross-reference in 
existing regulations.

DATES: This rule is effective August 21, 2024.

FOR FURTHER INFORMATION CONTACT: OFAC: Assistant Director for 
Licensing, 202-622-2480; Assistant Director for Regulatory Affairs, 
202-622-4855; or Assistant Director for Compliance, 202-622-2490.

SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION:

Electronic Availability

    This document and additional information concerning OFAC are 
available on OFAC's website: <a href="https://ofac.treasury.gov">https://ofac.treasury.gov</a>.

Background

    In this document, OFAC is updating three parts of 31 CFR chapter V 
to add a general license, to update language, and to correct an 
erroneous reference. In the Burma Sanctions Regulations, 31 CFR part 
525, OFAC is updating the authorities section to add a reference to 
recent legislation and adding a general license at Sec.  525.512 to 
authorize the provision of agricultural commodities, medicine, medical 
devices, replacement parts and components for medical devices, or 
software updates for medical devices to individuals whose property and 
interests in property are blocked pursuant to the Burma Sanctions 
Regulations.
    In the Sudan Stabilization Sanctions Regulations, 31 CFR part 546, 
OFAC is updating three instances of the term ``the Office of Foreign 
Assets Control'' or ``the Director of the Office of Foreign Assets 
Control'' with the acronym ``OFAC'' in sections Sec.  546.202(d), Sec.  
546.203(e), and Sec.  546.703. Finally, in the Ukraine-/Russia-Related 
Sanctions Regulations, 31 CFR part 589, OFAC is updating the 
authorities section to reference two Executive orders issued pursuant 
to the national emergency declared in Executive Order 13660, ``Blocking 
Property of Certain Persons Contributing to the Situation in Ukraine'' 
(79 FR 13493), and correcting an erroneous cross-reference appearing in 
Sec.  589.520.

Public Participation

    Because the amendment of the Regulations is a rule of agency 
procedure and because it involves a foreign affairs function, the 
provisions of Executive Order 12866 of September 30, 1993, ``Regulatory 
Planning and Review'' (58 FR 51735, October 4, 1993), as amended, and 
the Administrative Procedure Act (5 U.S.C. 553) requiring notice of 
proposed rulemaking,

[[Page 67557]]

opportunity for public participation, and delay in effective date are 
inapplicable. Because no notice of proposed rulemaking is required for 
this rule, the Regulatory Flexibility Act (5 U.S.C. 601-612) does not 
apply.

Paperwork Reduction Act

    The collections of information related to the regulations being 
amended in this rule are contained in 31 CFR part 501 (the ``Reporting, 
Procedures and Penalties Regulations''). Pursuant to the Paperwork 
Reduction Act of 1995 (44 U.S.C. 3507), those collections of 
information have been approved by the Office of Management and Budget 
under control number 1505-0164. An agency may not conduct or sponsor, 
and a person is not required to respond to, a collection of information 
unless the collection of information displays a valid control number.

List of Subjects in 31 CFR Parts 525, 546, and 589

    Administrative practice and procedure, Banks, banking, Blocking of 
assets, Burma, Credit, Foreign trade, Penalties, Reporting and 
recordkeeping requirements, Russian Federation, Sanctions, Securities, 
Services, Sudan, Ukraine.

    For the reasons set forth in the preamble, OFAC is issuing the 
following amendments:
