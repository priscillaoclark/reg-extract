SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION: 
    OMB Number: 3133-0165.
    Title: Fair Credit Reporting (FCRA), Regulation V and 12 CFR 717.
    Type of Review: Extension of a previously approved collection.
    Abstract: The Fair Credit Reporting Act (FCRA) sets standards for 
the collection, communication, and use of information bearing on a 
consumer's creditworthiness, credit standing, credit capacity, 
character, general reputation, personal characteristics, or mode of 
living. FCRA has been revised numerous times since it took effect, 
notably by passage of the Consumer Credit Reporting Reform Act of 1996, 
the Gramm-Leach-Bliley Act of 1999, and the Fair and Accurate Credit 
Transactions Act of 2003. Regulation V contains several requirements 
that impose information collection requirements on federal credit 
unions: the negative information notice; risk-based pricing; the 
procedures to enhance the accuracy and integrity of information 
furnished to consumer reporting agencies; the duties upon notice of 
dispute from a consumer; the affiliate marketing opt-out notice; and 
the prescreened consumer reports opt-out notice. The collection of 
information pursuant to Parts 1022 and 717 is triggered by specific 
events and disclosures and must be provided to consumers within the 
time periods established under the regulation. Regulation V and 12 CFR 
717 includes model notices and/or model forms that can be used to 
comply with the disclosure requirements of FCRA.
    Affected Public: Private Sector: Not-for-profit institutions; 
Individuals or Households.
    Estimated Total Annual Burden Hours: 272,686.
    Request for Comments: Comments submitted in response to this notice 
will be summarized and included in the request for Office of Management 
and Budget approval. All comments will become a matter of public 
record. The public is invited to submit comments concerning: (a) 
whether the collection of information is necessary for the proper 
performance of the function of the agency, including whether the 
information will have practical utility; (b) the accuracy of the 
agency's estimate of the burden of the collection of information, 
including the validity of the methodology and assumptions used; (c) 
ways to enhance the quality, utility, and clarity of the information to 
be collected; and (d) ways to minimize the burden of the collection of 
the information on the respondents, including the use of automated

collection techniques or other forms of information technology.
