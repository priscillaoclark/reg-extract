SECURITIES AND EXCHANGE COMMISSION

 
Submission for OMB Review; Comment Request

Upon Written Request, Copies Available From: Securities and Exchange 
Commission, Office of Filings and Information Services, Washington, DC 
20549.

Extension:
    Rule 17a-3(a)(16); SEC File No. 270-452; OMB Control No. 3235-
0508.

    Notice is hereby given that pursuant to the Paperwork Reduction Act 
of 1995 (44 U.S.C. 3501 et seq.), the Securities and Exchange 
Commission (``Commission'') has submitted to the Office of Management 
and Budget (``OMB'') a request for extension of the previously approved 
collection of information discussed below.
    Rule 17a-3(a)(16) (17 CFR Sec. 240.17a-3(a)(16)) under the 
Securities Exchange Act of 1934 (the ``Act'') (15 U.S.C. 78q et seq.) 
identifies the records required to be made by broker-dealers

[[Page 65392]]

that operate internal broker-dealer systems. Those records are to be 
used in monitoring compliance with the Commission's financial 
responsibility program and antifraud and antimanipulative rules, as 
well as other rules and regulations of the Commission and the self-
regulatory organizations. It is estimated that approximately 105 active 
broker-dealer respondents registered with the Commission incur an 
average burden of 2,835 hours per year (105 respondents multiplied by 
27 burden hours per respondent equals 2,385 total burden hours) to 
comply with this rule.\1\
---------------------------------------------------------------------------

    \1\ The average cost per hour is $258. Therefore the total cost 
of compliance for the respondents is $731,430.
---------------------------------------------------------------------------

    Rule 17a-3(a)(16) does not contain record retention requirements. 
Compliance with the rule is mandatory. The required records are 
available only to the examination staff of the Commission and the self-
regulatory organization of which the broker-dealer is a member. An 
agency may not conduct or sponsor and a person is not required to 
respond to a collection of information unless it displays a currently 
valid control number.
    Comments should be directed to: (i) Desk Officer for the Securities 
and Exchange Commission, Office of Information and Regulatory Affairs, 
Office of Management and Budget, Room 10102, New Executive Office 
Building, Washington, DC 20503, or by sending an e-mail to: <A HREF="mailto:Shagufta_Ahmed@omb.eop.gov">Shagufta_
Ahmed@omb.eop.gov</A>; and (ii) Jeffrey Heslop, Acting Director/Chief 
Information Officer, Securities and Exchange Commission, c/o Remi 
Pavlik-Simon, 6432 General Green Way, Alexandria, VA 22312, or send an 
e-mail to: <A HREF="mailto:PRA_Mailbox@sec.gov">PRA_Mailbox@sec.gov</A>. Comments must be submitted to OMB 
within 30 days of this notice.

    Dated: October 18, 2010.
Florence E. Harmon,
Deputy Secretary.
