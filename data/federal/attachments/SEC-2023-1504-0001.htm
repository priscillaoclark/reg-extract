SECURITIES AND EXCHANGE COMMISSION

[Release No. 34-99204; File No. SR-FINRA-2023-015]


Self-Regulatory Organizations; Financial Industry Regulatory 
Authority, Inc.; Notice of Designation of Longer Period for Commission 
Action on Proposed Rule Change Relating to Dissemination of Information 
on Individual Transactions in U.S. Treasury Securities and Related Fees

December 19, 2023.
    On November 2, 2023, the Financial Industry Regulatory Authority, 
Inc. (``FINRA'') filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission 
(``Commission''), pursuant to Section 19(b)(1) of the Securities 
Exchange Act of 1934 (``Act'') \1\ and Rule 19b-4 thereunder,\2\ a 
proposed rule change to (1) amend FINRA Rules 6710 and 6750 to provide 
that FINRA will disseminate information on individual transactions in 
U.S. Treasury Securities that are On-the-Run Nominal Coupons reported 
to FINRA's Trade Reporting and Compliance Engine (``TRACE'') on an end-
of-day basis with specified dissemination caps for large trades, and 
(2) amend FINRA Rule 7730 to include U.S. Treasury Securities within 
the existing fee structure for end-of-day and historic TRACE data. The 
proposed rule change was published for comment in the Federal Register 
on November 9, 2023.\3\ Section 19(b)(2) of the Act \4\ provides that, 
within 45 days of the publication of notice of the filing of a proposed 
rule change, or within such longer period up to 90 days as the 
Commission may designate if it finds such longer period to be 
appropriate and publishes its reasons for so finding or as to which the 
self-regulatory organization consents, the Commission shall either 
approve the proposed rule change, disapprove the proposed rule change, 
or institute proceedings to determine whether the proposed rule change 
should be disapproved. The 45th day after publication of the notice for 
this proposed rule change is December 24, 2023. The Commission is 
extending this 45-day time period for Commission action. The Commission 
finds that it is appropriate to designate a longer period within which 
to take action on the proposed rule change so that it has sufficient 
time to consider the proposed rule change and the comments received. 
Accordingly, pursuant to Section 19(b)(2) of the Act, the Commission 
designates February 7, 2024, as the date by which the Commission shall 
approve or disapprove, or institute proceedings to determine whether to 
disapprove, the proposed rule change (File No. SR-FINRA-2023-015).
