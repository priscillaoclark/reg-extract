SECURITIES AND EXCHANGE COMMISSION

[Release No. 34-101423; File No. SR-MRX-2024-40]


Self-Regulatory Organizations; Nasdaq MRX, LLC; Notice of Filing 
and Immediate Effectiveness of Proposed Rule Change To Allow Unlimited 
External Distribution of Derived Data From MRX Options Trade Outline

October 23, 2024.
    Pursuant to Section 19(b)(1) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 
(``Act''),\1\ and Rule 19b-4 thereunder,\2\ notice is hereby given that 
on October 9, 2024, Nasdaq MRX, LLC (``MRX'' or ``Exchange'') filed 
with the Securities and Exchange Commission (``SEC'' or ``Commission'') 
a proposed rule change as described in Items I, II, and III below, 
which Items have been prepared by the Exchange. The Commission is 
publishing this notice to solicit comments on the proposed rule change 
from interested persons.
---------------------------------------------------------------------------

    \1\ 15 U.S.C. 78s(b)(1).
    \2\ 17 CFR 240.19b-4.
---------------------------------------------------------------------------

I. Self-Regulatory Organization's Statement of the Terms of Substance 
of the Proposed Rule Change

    The Exchange proposes to allow unlimited external distribution of 
Derived Data from MRX Options Trade Outline.
    The text of the proposed rule change is available on the Exchange's 
website at <a href="https://listingcenter.nasdaq.com/rulebook/mrx/rules">https://listingcenter.nasdaq.com/rulebook/mrx/rules</a>, at the 
principal office of the Exchange, and at the Commission's Public 
Reference Room.

II. Self-Regulatory Organization's Statement of the Purpose of, and 
Statutory Basis for, the Proposed Rule Change

    In its filing with the Commission, the Exchange included statements 
concerning the purpose of and basis for the proposed rule change and 
discussed any comments it received on the proposed rule change. The 
text of these statements may be examined at the places specified in 
Item IV below. The Exchange has prepared summaries, set forth in 
sections A, B, and C below, of the most significant aspects of such 
statements.

A. Self-Regulatory Organization's Statement of the Purpose of, and 
Statutory Basis for, the Proposed Rule Change

1. Purpose
    The purpose of the proposed rule change is to allow unlimited 
external distribution of Derived Data from MRX Options Trade Outline 
for a monthly fee of $3,000.\3\
---------------------------------------------------------------------------

    \3\ This proposal was initially filed on September 27, 2024, as 
SR-MRX-2024-038. On October 9, 2024, that filing was withdrawn and 
replaced with the instant filing to provide further clarification.
---------------------------------------------------------------------------

MRX Options Trade Outline
    MRX Options Trade Outline provides aggregate quantity and volume 
information for trades on the Exchange for all series \4\ during a 
trading session.\5\
---------------------------------------------------------------------------

    \4\ Every options series trades as a distinct symbol; the terms 
``series'' and ``symbol'' are therefore synonyms.
    \5\ See Securities Exchange Act Release No. 100789 (August 21, 
2024), 89 FR 68680 (August 27, 2024) (SR-MRX-2024-31).
---------------------------------------------------------------------------

    Information is provided on an End of Day, Intra-Day, and historical 
basis in the following categories: (i) total exchange volume for Intra-
Day information and total exchange and industry volume for End of Day 
information for each reported series; (ii) open interest for the 
series; (iii) aggregate quantity of trades and aggregate trade volume 
effected to open a position,\6\ characterized by origin type (Priority 
Customers,\7\ Broker-Dealers,\8\ Market Makers,\9\ Firm 
Proprietary,\10\ and Professional Customers \11\); and (iv) aggregate 
quantity of trades and aggregate trade volume effected to close a 
position,\12\ characterized by origin type (Priority Customers, Broker-
Dealers, Market Makers, Firm Proprietary, and Professional 
Customers).\13\
---------------------------------------------------------------------------

    \6\ This includes the aggregate number of ``opening purchase 
transactions,'' defined as an Exchange Transaction that will create 
or increase a long position in an options contract, see Options 1, 
Section 1(a)(27), and the aggregate number of ``opening writing 
transactions,'' defined as an Exchange Transaction that will create 
or increase a short position in an options contract. See Options 1, 
Section 1(a)(28).
    \7\ The term ``Priority Customer'' means a person or entity that 
(i) is not a broker or dealer in securities, and (ii) does not place 
more than 390 orders in listed options per day on average during a 
calendar month for its own beneficial account(s). See Options 1 
Sec.  1(a)(36).
    \8\ A ``Broker-Dealer'' order is an order submitted by a Member 
for a broker-dealer account that is not its own proprietary account. 
See Options 7 Sec.  1(c).
    \9\ The term ``Market Makers'' refers to ``Competitive Market 
Makers'' and ``Primary Market Makers'' collectively. See Options 1 
Sec.  1(a)(21). The term ``Competitive Market Maker'' means a Member 
that is approved to exercise trading privileges associated with CMM 
Rights. See Options 1 Sec.  1(a)(12). The term ``Primary Market 
Maker'' means a Member that is approved to exercise trading 
privileges associated with PMM Rights. See Options 1 Section 
1(a)(35).
    \10\ A ``Firm Proprietary'' order is an order submitted by a 
Member for its own proprietary account. See Options 7 Section 1(c).
    \11\ A ``Professional Customer'' is a person or entity that is 
not a broker/dealer and is not a Priority Customer. See Options 7 
Section 1(c).
    \12\ This includes the aggregate number of ``closing purchase 
transactions'' in the affected series, defined as an Exchange 
Transaction that will reduce or eliminate a short position in an 
options contract, see Options 1, Section 1(a)(9), and the aggregate 
number of ``closing writing transactions,'' defined as an Exchange 
Transaction that will reduce or eliminate a long position in an 
options contract. See Options 1, Section 1(a)(10).
    \13\ These are the same types of information available on PHOTO, 
and the other trade outline products offered by Nasdaq exchanges.
---------------------------------------------------------------------------

End of Day Information
    The MRX Trade Outline End of Day file provides opening buy, closing 
buy, opening sell and closing sell information, including option first 
trade price, option high trade price, option low trade price, and 
option last trade price. The End of Day file is updated during an 
overnight process with additional fields \14\ and will be available the 
following morning, providing aggregate data for the entire trading 
session.
---------------------------------------------------------------------------

    \14\ The additional fields are: First Trade Price, High Trade 
Price, Low Trade Price, Last Trade Price, Underlying Close, 
Moneyness, Total Exchange volume, Total Industry Volume for the 
Series, and Open Interest.
---------------------------------------------------------------------------

Intra-Day Information
    Intra-Day information will be released in scheduled ``snapshots'' 
available every 10 minutes for all options series over the course of 
the trading day. These snapshots will be updated to reflect whatever 
activity occurred, or to indicate that no activity occurred.\15\
---------------------------------------------------------------------------

    \15\ Subscribers will receive the first snapshot at 9:42 a.m. 
ET, representing data captured from 9:30 a.m. to 9:40 a.m., and the 
second calculation at 9:52 a.m., representing data from both the 
most recent snapshot and previous snapshots, and continuing over the 
course of the trading day. The final Intra-Day snapshot will be 
distributed at 4:15 p.m.
---------------------------------------------------------------------------

Historical Information
    Historical data will be available through ad hoc requests for 
information in both End of Day and Intra-Day formats for all option 
series traded for every calendar month after September 2017, based on 
specific request.\16\
---------------------------------------------------------------------------

    \16\ Market participants generally use historical files for 
model testing and research, and the period of time required by a 
particular market participant will depend on its unique testing and 
research needs as well as whether it is using End of Day or Intra-
Day information. Some customers, for example, may request years of 
data, while others only months, or even a single month. The same 
principle applies to End of Day vs. Intra-Day information.

---------------------------------------------------------------------------

[[Page 86387]]

    MRX Options Trade Outline includes proprietary Exchange trading 
data and does not disseminate any intra-day trading data from any other 
exchange.\17\
---------------------------------------------------------------------------

    \17\ The End of Day report includes a field that presents Total 
Industry Volume for the Series.
---------------------------------------------------------------------------

    The information provided, both in End of Day and Intra-Day formats, 
will not be a real-time data feed.
    MRX Options Trade Outline is a completely voluntary product in that 
the Exchange is not required by any rule or regulation to make this 
data available and potential subscribers may purchase it only if they 
voluntarily choose to do so.
    Nasdaq's experience is that investment banks, market makers, asset 
managers and other buy-side investors purchase trade outline products.
Proposed Fees
    The Exchange proposes to allow unlimited external distribution of 
Derived Data from MRX Options Trade Outline for a monthly fee of 
$3,000. This will encourage Distributors to create and sell analytic 
products to the general investing public. External distribution of 
Derived Data is not currently permitted. The same Derived Data license 
is also offered by the Nasdaq PHLX, LLC (``Phlx''),\18\ Nasdaq ISE, LLC 
(``ISE''),\19\ and Nasdaq GEMX, LLC (``GEMX'') \20\ exchanges and the 
Nasdaq Stock Market LLC (``Nasdaq Options Market'' or ``NOM'').\21\ A 
Derived Data license is also being proposed for the BX exchange 
concurrently with this proposal.
---------------------------------------------------------------------------

    \18\ See Securities Exchange Act Release No. 93293 (October 12, 
2021), 86 FR 57716 (October 18, 2021) (SR-Phlx-2021-58).
    \19\ See ISE Options 7, Section 10(A).
    \20\ See GEMX Options 7, Section 7(D).
    \21\ See Nasdaq Options 7, Section 4.
---------------------------------------------------------------------------

    Derived Data is ``any information generated in whole or in part 
from Exchange Information \22\ such that the information generated 
cannot be reverse engineered to recreate Exchange Information, or be 
used to create other data that is recognizable as a reasonable 
substitute for such Exchange Information.''
---------------------------------------------------------------------------

    \22\ ``Exchange Information'' is any data or information that 
has been collected, validated, processed and/or recorded by the 
Exchange and made available for transmission relating to: (i) 
eligible securities or other financial instruments, markets, 
products, vehicles, indicators, or devices; (ii) activities of the 
Exchange; or (iii) other information or data from the Exchange. 
Information includes, but is not limited to, any element of 
information used or processed in such a way that Exchange 
Information or a substitute for such Information can be identified, 
recalculated or re-engineered from the processed information.
---------------------------------------------------------------------------

    Fees for external distribution of Derived Data from MRX Options 
Trade Outline are in addition to fees for the End of Day product or the 
Intraday product, or both, as applicable.
    The proposal is designed to promote the dissemination of a variety 
of analytical insights--generally used only by investment banks, market 
makers, asset managers and other buy-side investors--to the general 
investing public by creating an incentive for market data vendors to 
identify, develop, and sell sentiment indicators and other products. 
The proposal will spur competition among not only exchanges, but 
vendors as well, thereby promoting innovation and improving the 
dissemination of information to the general investing public.
2. Statutory Basis
    The Exchange believes that its proposal is consistent with Section 
6(b) of the Act,\23\ in general, and furthers the objectives of 
Sections 6(b)(4) and 6(b)(5) of the Act,\24\ in particular, in that it 
provides for the equitable allocation of reasonable dues, fees, and 
other charges among members and issuers and other persons using any 
facility, and is not designed to permit unfair discrimination between 
customers, issuers, brokers, or dealers.
---------------------------------------------------------------------------

    \23\ 15 U.S.C. 78f(b).
    \24\ 15 U.S.C. 78f(b)(4) and (5).
---------------------------------------------------------------------------

Equitable Allocation of Reasonable Dues, Fees and Other Charges
    The proposed changes are an equitable allocation of reasonable 
dues, fees and other charges because: (i) the trade profile products 
offered by multiple exchanges are substitutes, and customers are free 
to choose which product they purchase; and (ii) the proposed fees are 
comparable to the fees charged by other exchanges, and customers are 
free to purchase other products if the Exchange has mistaken the value 
of its product.
Substitution
    Products similar to Trade Outline are offered by many exchanges, 
including Nasdaq affiliates such as Phlx,\25\ ISE,\26\ GEMX,\27\ and 
NOM,\28\ and options markets not affiliated with Nasdaq such as Cboe 
Options Exchange (``Cboe''),\29\ NYSE American Options (``NYSE 
American''),\30\ NYSE Arca Options (``NYSE Arca''),\31\ BOX Options 
Market LLC (``BOX''),\32\ and MIAX Pearl Options Exchange 
(``Pearl'').\33\

21, 2023), 88 FR 18201 (March 27, 2023) (SR-BOX-2023-09) (describing 
the BOX exchange Open-Close Data report as providing volume by 
origin, buying/selling, and opening/closing criteria).
    \33\ See, e.g., Securities Exchange Act Release No. 91964 (May 
21, 2021), 86 FR 28667 (May 27, 2021) (SR-PEARL-2021-24) 
(introducing the Open-Close Report).
---------------------------------------------------------------------------

    All of the trade outline products offered by the Nasdaq-affiliated 
exchanges include a license for the unlimited external distribution of 
Derived Data.\34\ As noted above, BX will be proposing the same license 
together with this proposal. All of these Derived Data licenses are 
direct substitutes.
---------------------------------------------------------------------------

    \34\ See supra notes 24-27.
---------------------------------------------------------------------------

    The underlying trade outline data provided by one exchange is 
generally similar to that provided by other exchanges because order 
flow can move from one exchange to another, and market sentiment trends 
that appear on one exchange are likely to be similar to the sentiment 
trends on other exchanges. The key differentiator among trade outline 
products depends on the volume of transactions on a given exchange; the 
greater the volume of transactions, the greater the value of the data. 
Customers generally purchase sufficient data to provide a view of the 
market, but not more, as the value of data from each additional 
exchange yields diminishing returns. Because customers can substitute 
trade outline products among exchanges, customers can also substitute 
the proposed Derived Data license for MRX with the Derived Data 
licenses of any of its affiliates.
    The proposed Derived Data license is also subject to potential 
competition from exchanges not affiliated with Nasdaq. Although the 
Exchange is not

[[Page 86388]]

aware of any exchanges offering a Derived Data license for trade 
outline other than its own affiliates, any exchange that wishes to 
allow distribution of a Derived Data product based on options trading 
information would be able to do so with an immediately effective fee 
filing similar to this proposal.
    All trade outline products are optional. Customers can, and do, 
choose to forego the information from Trade Outline or any of its 
competitor products when making a trade, and the same holds for Derived 
Data from trade outline products.
    As the Commission and courts \35\ have recognized, ``[i]f 
competitive forces are operative, the self-interest of the exchanges 
themselves will work powerfully to constrain unreasonable or unfair 
behavior.'' \36\ Accordingly, ``the existence of significant 
competition provides a substantial basis for finding that the terms of 
an exchange's fee proposal are equitable, fair, reasonable, and not 
unreasonably or unfairly discriminatory.'' \37\ The Commission and the 
courts have repeatedly expressed their preference for competition over 
regulatory intervention in determining prices, products, and services 
in the securities markets. In Regulation NMS, while adopting a series 
of steps to improve the current market model, the Commission 
highlighted the importance of market forces in determining prices and 
SRO revenues, and also recognized that current regulation of the market 
system ``has been remarkably successful in promoting market competition 
in its broader forms that are most important to investors and listed 
companies.'' \38\
---------------------------------------------------------------------------

    \35\ The decision of the United States Court of Appeals for the 
District of Columbia Circuit in NetCoalition v. SEC, 615 F.3d 525 
(D.C. Cir. 2010) upheld the Commission's reliance upon competitive 
markets to set reasonable and equitably allocated fees for market 
data. ``In fact, the legislative history indicates that the Congress 
intended that the market system evolve through the interplay of 
competitive forces as unnecessary regulatory restrictions are 
removed and that the SEC wield its regulatory power in those 
situations where competition may not be sufficient, such as in the 
creation of a consolidated transactional reporting system.'' 
NetCoalition I at 535 (quoting H.R. Rep. No. 94-229, at 92 (1975), 
as reprinted in 1975 U.S.C.C.A.N. 321, 323) (internal quotation 
marks omitted). The court agreed with the Commission's conclusion 
that ``Congress intended that competitive forces should dictate the 
services and practices that constitute the U.S. national market 
system for trading equity securities.'' Id. (quoting Securities 
Exchange Act Release No. 59039 (December 2, 2008), 73 FR 74770, 
74771 (December 9, 2008) (SR-NYSEArca-2006-21)).
    \36\ See Securities Exchange Act Release No. 59039 (December 2, 
2008), 73 FR 74770 (December 9, 2008) (SR-NYSEArca-2006-21).
    \37\ See id.
    \38\ See Securities Exchange Act Release No. 51808 (June 9, 
2005), 70 FR 37496, 37499 (June 29, 2005) (``Regulation NMS Adopting 
Release'').
---------------------------------------------------------------------------

    Because the proposed Derived Data license is currently subject to 
competition from other Nasdaq exchanges, and potentially subject to 
competition from other exchanges, the Exchange will be limited in what 
it is able to charge for the license, and the proposed fee is therefore 
a reasonable allocation of dues, fees and other charges.
Comparability
    The proposed fees for the Derived Data license are comparable to 
the fees charged by similarly situated exchanges for the same license.
    All of the Nasdaq-affiliated exchanges offer a Derived Data license 
for their trade outline products. As explained above, the value of any 
trade outline product is determined in part by the number of underlying 
transactions reflected in the data.
    The proposed fees for the Derived Data license are the same as the 
fees charged by similarly situated exchanges. MRX has a market share of 
approximately 4 percent, similar to that of GEMX (at approximately 3 
percent).\39\ The proposed monthly fee of $3,000 for the unlimited 
external distribution of Derived Data is identical to the fee charged 
by GEMX.\40\
---------------------------------------------------------------------------

    \39\ See <a href="http://NasdaqTrader.com">NasdaqTrader.com</a>, ``Options Market Statistics,'' 
available at <a href="https://www.nasdaqtrader.com/Trader.aspx?id=OptionsVolumeSummary">https://www.nasdaqtrader.com/Trader.aspx?id=OptionsVolumeSummary</a>.
    \40\ See GEMX Options 7, Section 7(D).
---------------------------------------------------------------------------

    The volume of trading on the MRX exchange is also similar to that 
on the BX exchange, which has a market share of approximately 2 
percent.\41\ Together with this filing, BX will propose the same 
monthly fee of $3,000 as MRX for the unlimited external distribution of 
Derived Data.
---------------------------------------------------------------------------

    \41\ See supra note 38.
---------------------------------------------------------------------------

    The Nasdaq-affiliated exchanges with larger market shares have 
comparably higher fees for the unlimited external distribution of 
Derived Data. Nasdaq Options Market, with a market share of 
approximately 5 percent,\42\ has a fee of $4,000 per month for the 
unlimited external distribution of Derived Data.\43\ ISE, with a market 
share of approximately 7 percent,\44\ has a fee of $4,500 per month for 
the unlimited external distribution of Derived Data.\45\ PHLX, with a 
market share of approximately 9 percent,\46\ has a fee of $5,000 per 
month for the unlimited external distribution of Derived Data.\47\
---------------------------------------------------------------------------

    \42\ See id.
    \43\ See Nasdaq Options 7, Section 4.
    \44\ See supra note 38.
    \45\ See ISE Options 7, Section 10(A).
    \46\ See supra note 38.
    \47\ See PHLX Options 7, Section 10.
---------------------------------------------------------------------------

    The proposed fees are therefore comparable to those charged by 
similarly situated exchanges and consistent with the fees for Derived 
Data licenses in the market overall. If the Exchange is wrong in its 
assessment of fees, it will lose sales as a result.
The Proposal Does Not Permit Unfair Discrimination
    The proposed Derived Data license is available to all market 
participants, including members and non-members, and all current and 
potential distributors, on the same terms. Nothing in the proposal 
treats any category of market participant any differently from any 
other category.
    It is reasonable and not unfair discrimination to charge an 
external distributor of Derived Data a $3,000 licensing fee that is not 
charged for internal usage. External distribution is fundamentally 
different than internal use. Vendors ordinarily charge a fee to their 
downstream customers for this service, and, even if the vendor is not 
charging a specific fee for this particular service, Derived Data 
products from the Exchange will be part of a suite of offerings that 
generally promote sales. It is not unfair discrimination to charge a 
licensing fee for a product that generates downstream revenue.
    It is also not unfair discrimination to allow the redistribution of 
Derived Data, but not the underlying information. Neither exchanges nor 
vendors ordinarily allow redistribution of analytic products--such 
products are typically designed solely for the use of direct customers, 
not for redistribution to the customers of customers in the manner of a 
data feed.
    The proposed licensing structure provides an incentive for vendors 
to innovate with new compelling and varied analytic products for the 
general investing public that will provide access to market sentiment 
insights currently available only to sophisticated investors.

B. Self-Regulatory Organization's Statement on Burden on Competition

    The Exchange does not believe that the proposed rule change will 
impose any burden on competition not necessary or appropriate in 
furtherance of the purposes of the Act. In terms of inter-market 
competition, the Exchange notes that it operates in a highly 
competitive market in which market

[[Page 86389]]

participants can readily favor competing venues if they deem fee levels 
at a particular venue to be excessive, or rebate opportunities 
available at other venues to be more favorable. In such an environment, 
the Exchange must continually adjust its fees to remain competitive 
with other exchanges and with alternative trading systems that have 
been exempted from compliance with the statutory standards applicable 
to exchanges. Because competitors are free to modify their own fees in 
response, and because market participants may readily adjust their 
order routing practices, the Exchange believes that the degree to which 
fee changes in this market may impose any burden on competition is 
extremely limited.
Intermarket Competition
    Nothing in the proposal burdens inter-market competition (the 
competition among self-regulatory organizations). As discussed above, 
MRX Trade Outline is subject to direct competition from other options 
exchanges that offer similar products. Any of these exchanges can 
replicate this proposal in full or in part, and nothing in the proposal 
would interfere with the ability of any exchange to do so.
Intramarket Competition
    Nothing in the proposal burdens intra-market competition (the 
competition among consumers of exchange data). Trade Outline is 
available to any customer under the same fee schedule as any other 
customer, and any market participant that wishes to purchase a license 
to distribute Derived Data can do so on a non-discriminatory basis.
    Indeed, the proposal is designed to foster competition for vendors 
as well as exchanges by creating an incentive for market data vendors 
to identify, develop, and sell analytic indicators to help investors 
inform their investments strategies and analytic models.

C. Self-Regulatory Organization's Statement on Comments on the Proposed 
Rule Change Received From Members, Participants, or Others

    No written comments were either solicited or received.

III. Date of Effectiveness of the Proposed Rule Change and Timing for 
Commission Action

    The foregoing rule change has become effective pursuant to Section 
19(b)(3)(A)(ii) of the Act.\48\ At any time within 60 days of the 
filing of the proposed rule change, the Commission summarily may 
temporarily suspend such rule change if it appears to the Commission 
that such action is: (i) necessary or appropriate in the public 
interest; (ii) for the protection of investors; or (iii) otherwise in 
furtherance of the purposes of the Act. If the Commission takes such 
action, the Commission shall institute proceedings to determine whether 
the proposed rule should be approved or disapproved.
