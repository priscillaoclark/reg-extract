---------------------------------------------------------------------------

    \3\ See Securities Exchange Act Release No. 34-62758 (August 23, 
2010), 75 FR 52792 (August 27, 2010) (SR-CBOE-2010-075).
    \4\ See Securities Exchange Act Release No. 34-62878 (September 
9, 2010), 75 FR 56627 (September 16, 2010) (SR-CBOE-2010-079).
    \5\ See Securities Exchange Act Release No. 34-63000 (September 
28, 2010), 75 FR 61549 (October 5, 2010) (SR-CBOE-2010-089).
---------------------------------------------------------------------------

    CBSX now proposes to modify its transaction fees so that all 
securities are subject to the Maker and Taker fees and rebates to which 
the aforementioned securities became subject. The Taker rebate shall be 
$0.0014 per share for transactions in all securities traded on CBSX 
that are priced $1 or greater. The Maker fee shall be $0.0018 per share 
for transactions in all securities traded on CBSX that are priced $1 or 
greater.
    Additionally, CBSX proposes to modify the Maker and Taker fees and 
rebates for transactions in securities priced less than $1. The Taker 
fee for such transactions shall be 0.05% of the dollar value of the 
transaction. The Maker rebate for such transaction shall be 0.01% of 
the dollar value of the transaction.
    Consistent with the new fees set forth above, CBSX also proposes to 
amend the fee and rebate for NBBO Step-Up Trades. For stocks priced $1 
and over, the order that is flashed will receive a $0.0014 per share 
rebate and the responder will be charged $0.0018 per share. For stocks 
priced under $1, the maker/taker fees will correspond to those in place 
for non-flashed executions (i.e., the Taker fee for such transactions 
shall be 0.05% of the dollar value of the transaction, and the Maker 
rebate for such transaction shall be 0.01% of the dollar value of the 
transaction).
    The fee changes will become effective on October 18, 2010.
2. Statutory Basis
    The proposed rule change is consistent with Section 6(b) of the 
Act,\6\ in general, and furthers the objectives of

[[Page 66818]]

Section 6(b)(4) \7\ of the Act in particular, in that it is designed to 
provide for the equitable allocation of reasonable dues, fees, and 
other charges among CBOE members and other persons using its 
facilities.

B. Self-Regulatory Organization's Statement on Burden on Competition

burden on competition not necessary or appropriate in furtherance of 
the purposes of the Act.

C. Self-Regulatory Organization's Statement on Comments on the Proposed 
Rule Change Received From Members, Participants, or Others

    No written comments were solicited or received with respect to the 
proposed rule change.

III. Date of Effectiveness of the Proposed Rule Change and Timing for 
Commission Action

qualifying for effectiveness on filing pursuant to Section 
19(b)(3)(A)(ii) \8\ of the Act and subparagraph (f)(2) of Rule 19b-4

change, the Commission summarily may temporarily suspend such rule 
change if it appears to the Commission that such action is necessary or
