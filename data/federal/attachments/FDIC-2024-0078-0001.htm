SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION: 
    1. Title: 2025 FDIC Survey of Deposit Insurance Awareness.
    OMB Number: 3064-NEW.
    Form Number: None.
    Affected Public: Individual members of the public.
    Burden Estimate:
    Frequency of Response: Once.

    General Description of Collection: The FDIC proposes to field a 
statistical consumer survey to assess awareness of the FDIC and of 
deposit insurance. Survey results will inform FDIC public awareness, 
communication, education, outreach and research efforts regarding 
deposit insurance, and will identify information and awareness gaps in 
terms of content and demographic segments. Research questions will 
cover consumers' knowledge of, attitudes towards, and behaviors 
regarding deposit insurance. The proposed 2025 FDIC Survey of Deposit 
Insurance Awareness is intended to collect information regarding what 
consumers

[[Page 78304]]

know about deposit insurance and how they learn it, what consumers 
think about deposit insurance and banking, and how this information 
shapes financial decisions. The survey will inform research and 
programmatic efforts to improve consumers' awareness and understanding 
of deposit insurance, to help fulfill the agency's mission of 
maintaining stability and public confidence in the nation's financial 
system.
    The survey will assess consumers' awareness and knowledge of the 
FDIC and its role regarding deposit insurance, including their 
understanding of the types of institutions and situations where deposit 
insurance applies, and the sources they use to learn about deposit 
insurance. The survey will also assess whether deposit insurance 
impacts consumers' confidence in the banking system and perceptions and 
use of bank and nonbank financial services, including their likelihood 
to consider deposit insurance when making decisions about financial 
products and services. Finally, the survey will collect background 
information regarding consumers' use of some bank and nonbank products, 
and the types of institutions they use to save or store money inside 
and outside of the banking system.
    The survey will be conducted in spring 2025 as part of Porter 
Novelli's PN Styles survey, using the IPSOS Knowledge Panel, a 
probability-based online panel in the U.S. PN Styles is a large-scale, 
representative survey of U.S. adults that tracks consumer attitudes and 
behaviors.
    Request for Comment:
    Comments are invited on (a) whether the collections of information 
are necessary for the proper performance of the FDIC's functions, 
including whether the information has practical utility; (b) the 
accuracy of the estimates of the burden of the information collections, 
including the validity of the methodology and assumptions used; (c) 
ways to enhance the quality, utility, and clarity of the information to 
be collected; and (d) ways to minimize the burden of the collections of 
information on respondents, including through the use of automated 
collection techniques or other forms of information technology. All 
comments will become a matter of public record.

Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation.

    Dated at Washington, DC, September 19, 2024.
James P. Sheesley,
Assistant Executive Secretary.
