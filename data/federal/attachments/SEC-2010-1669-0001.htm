II. Self-Regulatory Organization's Statement of the Purpose of, and 
Statutory Basis for, the Proposed Rule Change

    In its filing with the Commission, the self-regulatory organization 
included statements concerning the purpose of, and basis for, the 
proposed rule change and discussed any comments it received on the 
proposed rule change. The text of these statements may be examined at 
the places specified in Item IV below. The self-regulatory organization 
has prepared summaries, set forth in sections A, B and C below, of the 
most significant aspects of such statements.

A. Self-Regulatory Organization's Statement of the Purpose of, and 
Statutory Basis for, the Proposed Rule Change

1. Purpose
    The Exchange proposes to make technical amendments to its rules to 
insert a specific date for a pilot program.
    The Commission recently approved the Exchange's proposal to 
establish a pilot program that would permit the Exchange to list up to 
an additional two expiration months, for a total of six expiration 
months for each class of options open for trading on the Exchange.\5\ 
This rule change proposes to amend the text of Supplementary Material 
.08 to Rule 504 to insert the specific conclusion date of the pilot 
program, which is October 31, 2011.\6\
---------------------------------------------------------------------------

    \5\ See Securities Exchange Act Release No. 63104 (October 14, 
2010), 75 FR 64773 (October 20, 2010) (Approving SR-ISE-2010-91).
    \6\ Previously the rule text indicated that the Exchange would 
insert the date 12 months from the next full month from approval, 
which approval occurred on October 14, 2010. Id.
---------------------------------------------------------------------------

2. Statutory Basis
    The proposed rule change is consistent with Section 6(b) \7\ of the 
Securities Exchange Act of 1934 (the ``Act''), in general, and furthers 
the objectives of Section 6(b)(5) \8\ in particular, in that it is 
designed to prevent fraudulent and manipulative acts and practices, to 
promote just and equitable principles of trade, to foster cooperation 
and coordination with persons engaged in facilitating transactions in 
securities, and to remove impediments to and perfect the mechanisms of 
a free and open market and a national market system in a manner 
consistent with the protection of investors and the public interest. In 
particular, the proposed rule change seeks to update rule text to 
insert specific dates for a pilot program in a manner that is 
consistent with the original approval order of the pilot program.

B. Self-Regulatory Organization's Statement on Burden on Competition

    The proposed rule change does not impose any burden on competition.

C. Self-Regulatory Organization's Statement on Comments on the Proposed 
Rule Change Received From Members, Participants, or Others

    The Exchange has not solicited, and does not intend to solicit, 
comments on this proposed rule change. The Exchange has not received 
any unsolicited written comments from members or other interested 
parties.

III. Date of Effectiveness of the Proposed Rule Change and Timing for 
Commission Action

    The foregoing proposed rule change will take effect upon filing 
with the Commission pursuant to Section 19(b)(3)(A)(i) of the Act \9\ 
and Rule 19b-4(f)(1) thereunder,\10\ because it constitutes a stated 
policy, practice, or interpretation with respect to the meaning, 
administration, or enforcement of an existing rule.

---------------------------------------------------------------------------

    At any time within 60 days of the filing of the proposed rule 
change, the Commission summarily may temporarily suspend such rule 
change if it appears to the Commission that such action is necessary or 
appropriate in the public interest, for the protection of investors, or 
otherwise in furtherance of the purposes of the Act.
