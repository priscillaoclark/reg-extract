    In its filing with the Commission, the self-regulatory organization

proposed rule change and discussed any comments it received on the

the places specified in Item IV below. The Exchange has prepared 
summaries, set forth in sections A, B, and C below, of the most 
significant parts of such statements.

[[Page 61238]]

A. Self-Regulatory Organization's Statement of the Purpose of, and 
Statutory Basis for, the Proposed Rule Change

1. Purpose
    CBOE proposes to make technical amendments to its rules to insert 
specific dates for two pilot programs.
    First, the Commission has approved the Exchange's proposal to 
modify the clearly erroneous policy of the CBOE Stock [sic] on a pilot 
basis.\3\ This rule change proposes to amend the text of Rule 52.4, 
Clearly Erroneous Policy, to insert the approval date of the pilot 
program, which is September 10, 2010.
---------------------------------------------------------------------------

    \3\ See Securities Exchange Act Release No. 62886 (September 10, 
2010) (approving SR-CBOE-2010-056).
---------------------------------------------------------------------------

    Second, the Commission has approved the Exchange's proposal to 
establish a pilot program that would permit P.M.-settled options on 
broad-based indexes that expire: (a) on any Friday of the month, other 
than the third Friday-of-the-month, and (b) the last trading \4\ [sic] 
of the month (``EOW/EOM Pilot Program'') under a 14-month pilot 
program.\5\ This rule change proposes to amend the text of Rule 29.4(e) 
\6\ [sic], Terms of Index Option Contracts, to insert the specific 
conclusion date of the EOW/EOM Pilot Program, which is December 14, 
2011.\7\
---------------------------------------------------------------------------

    \4\ The Commission notes that the correct reference is to the 
``last trading day of the month.''
    \5\ See Securities Exchange Act Release No. 62911 (September 14, 
2010) (approving SR-CBOE-2009-075).
    \6\ The Commission notes that the correct rule number is Rule 
24.9(e).
    \7\ Previously the rule text indicated that the Exchange would 
insert the date 14 months from the next full month from approval, 
which approval occurred on September 14, 2010. See supra note 5.
---------------------------------------------------------------------------

2. Statutory Basis
    The basis under the Act for this proposed rule change is the 
requirement under Section 6(b)(5) \8\ that an exchange have rules that 
are designed to promote just and equitable principles of trade, and to 
remove impediments to and perfect the mechanism for a free and open 
market and a national market system, and, in general, to protect 
investors and the public interest. In particular, the proposed rule 
change seeks to update rule text to insert specific dates for two pilot 
programs in a manner that is consistent with the original approval 
orders of the pilot programs.
---------------------------------------------------------------------------

    \8\ 15 U.S.C. 78f(b)(5).
---------------------------------------------------------------------------

B. Self-Regulatory Organization's Statement on Burden on Competition

    CBOE does not believe that the proposed rule change will impose any 
burden on competition not necessary or appropriate in furtherance of 
the purposes of the Act.

C. Self-Regulatory Organization's Statement on Comments on the Proposed 
Rule Change Received From Members, Participants, or Others

    The Exchange neither solicited nor received comments on the 
proposal.

III. Date of Effectiveness of the Proposed Rule Change and Timing for 
Commission Action

    The foregoing proposed rule change will take effect upon filing 
with the Commission pursuant to Section 19(b)(3)(A)(i) of the Act \9\ 
and Rule 19b-4(f)(1) thereunder,\10\ because it constitutes a stated 
policy, practice, or interpretation with respect to the meaning, 
administration, or enforcement of an existing rule.
---------------------------------------------------------------------------

    \9\ 15 U.S.C. 78s(b)(3)(A)(i).
    \10\ 17 CFR 240.19b-4(f)(1).
---------------------------------------------------------------------------

    At any time within 60 days of the filing of the proposed rule 
change, the Commission summarily may temporarily suspend such rule 
change if it appears to the Commission that such action is necessary or 
appropriate in the public interest, for the protection of investors, or 
otherwise in furtherance of the purposes of the Act.
