commercial lending institutions to understand their experience with 
EXIM ``meeting financial competition from other countries whose 
exporters compete with United States exporters.'' EXIM plans to survey 
exporters and lenders that have engaged with EXIM on medium- and long-

one of EXIM's last two surveys. The potential respondents will be sent 
an electronic invitation to participate in the online survey.
