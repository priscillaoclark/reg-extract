II. Self-Regulatory Organization's Statement of the Terms of Substance 
of the Proposed Partial Amendment

    FINRA is proposing the following amendments to the filing:

1. FINRA Proposes To Amend the Proposed Manual Trades Exception To 
Provide FINRA Members With an Additional Year To Transition to Five-
Minute Reporting for Manual Trades

    As discussed in the original filing, the proposed rule change would 
create an exception from the proposed one-minute reporting requirement 
for manual trades.\13\ As originally proposed, manual trades would have 
been subject to reporting as soon as practicable with a five-minute 
outer-limit reporting timeframe, phased in after two years.\14\ 
Specifically, where a trade qualified for the manual trades exception, 
a 15-minute outer limit would have applied for the first year following 
implementation; a 10-minute outer limit would have applied for the 
second year; and a five-minute outer limit would have applied 
thereafter.\15\ Some commenters raised various concerns regarding the 
feasibility of five-minute reporting for manual trades, and some 
commenters recommended that FINRA study and assess (and provide an 
opportunity for public comment on) the feasibility of five-minute 
reporting for manual trades prior to its implementation or maintain a 
15-minute reporting requirement for manual trades.\16\
---------------------------------------------------------------------------

    \13\ See Notice, supra note 3.
    \14\ Id.
    \15\ Id.
    \16\ See Partial Amendment No. 1 at 4.
---------------------------------------------------------------------------

    In response to these comments, FINRA is amending the proposed rule 
change to extend the phase-in period for five-minute reporting by one 
year so that FINRA members would have three years to transition to 
five-minute reporting for manual trades.\17\
---------------------------------------------------------------------------

    \17\ Id.
---------------------------------------------------------------------------

    Accordingly, the proposed rule change, as amended, would provide 
that a FINRA member relying on the manual trades exception will be 
required to report the manual trade as soon as practicable and no later 
than within 15 minutes of the time of execution (for up to one calendar 
year from the effectiveness of the proposed amendments), within 10 
minutes of the time of execution (for up to three calendar years from 
the effectiveness of the proposed amendments), and within five minutes 
of the time of execution (three or more calendar years from the 
effectiveness of the proposed amendments).\18\ Partial Amendment No. 1 
will provide FINRA with additional time to assess FINRA members' trade 
reporting times in connection with manual trades and request comment on 
the operation of the manual trades exception--and FINRA will be 
prepared to make adjustments, as necessary, prior to the effectiveness 
of the five-minute reporting timeframe.\19\
---------------------------------------------------------------------------

    \18\ See proposed Rule 6730.09(b).
    \19\ See Partial Amendment No. 1 at 5.
---------------------------------------------------------------------------

    Following are the changes proposed in Partial Amendment No. 1, with 
the proposed changes in the original filing shown as if adopted. 
Proposed new language in Partial Amendment No. 1 is italicized; 
proposed deletions in Partial Amendment No. 1 are in brackets:

6730. Transaction Reporting

    (a) through (f) No Change.

<bullet> <bullet> <bullet> Supplementary Material:----------

    .01 through .08 No Change.

.09 Exception for Manual Trades

    (a) No Change.
    (b) Except as otherwise specifically provided in paragraph (a)(2) 
of this Rule with respect to List or Fixed Offering Price Transactions 
and Takedown Transactions, a member relying on the exception for manual 
trades in this Supplementary Material .09 must report the transaction 
as soon as practicable but no later than within: 15 minutes of the Time 
of Execution (this 15-minute outer timeframe is available for up to one 
calendar year from the effectiveness of this Supplementary Material 
.09); within 10 minutes of the Time of Execution (this 10-minute outer 
timeframe is available for up to three[two] calendar years from the 
effectiveness of this Supplementary Material .09); or within 5 minutes 
of the Time of Execution (this 5-minute outer timeframe is applicable 
three[two] or more calendars years from the effectiveness of this 
Supplementary Material .09), as further provided in this paragraph.
    (1) No Change.
(2) Transactions Executed During TRACE System Hours
    Transactions executed on a business day at or after 8:00:00 a.m. 
Eastern Time through 6:29:59 p.m. Eastern Time (standard TRACE System 
Hours) must be reported as soon as practicable, but no later than 
within 15, 10, or 5 minutes of the Time of Execution[after the TRACE 
system opens] (the 15-, 10-, or 5-minute outer timeframe is available 
for up to one year, up to three[two]

[[Page 61516]]

years, or three[two] or more years, respectively, from the 
effectiveness of this Supplementary Material .09), except as provided 
in paragraph (b)(3) of this Supplementary Material .09.
(3) Transactions Executed Less Than 5 Minutes Before TRACE System 
Closes
    Transactions executed on a business day less than 15, 10, or 5 
minutes (the 15-, 10-, or 5-minute timeframe is available for up to one 
year, up to three[two] years, or three[two] or more years, 
respectively, from the effectiveness of this Supplementary Material 
.09) before 6:30:00 p.m. Eastern Time must be reported as soon as 
practicable after the TRACE system opens the next business day (T + 1), 
but no later than within 15 minutes after the TRACE system opens the 
next business day, and if reported on T + 1, designated ``as/of'' and 
include the date of execution.
    (4) No Change.

2. FINRA Proposes To Make a Correction to the Text of Proposed Rule 
6730.09(b)(2)

    Additionally, Partial Amendment No. 1 would make a correction to 
the proposed rule text such that proposed Rule 6730.09(b)(2) would 
require reporting within the prescribed timeframe from ``the Time of 
Execution'' rather than ``after the TRACE system opens.'' \20\ As 
originally proposed, for transactions subject to the manual trades 
exception that were executed on a business day at or after 8:00:00 a.m. 
Eastern Time (``ET'') through 6:29:59 p.m. ET (i.e., during TRACE 
system hours), the rule text erroneously would have required reporting 
``. . . as soon as practicable, but no later than within 15, 10, or 5 
minutes after the TRACE system opens. . . .'' \21\ Partial Amendment 
No. 1 would correct the text of proposed Rule 6730.09(b)(2) so that it 
requires reporting of these transactions ``. . . as soon as 
practicable, but no later than within 15, 10, or 5 minutes of the Time 
of Execution. . . .'' \22\
---------------------------------------------------------------------------

    \20\ See Partial Amendment No. 1 at 5.
    \21\ See proposed Rule 6730.09(b)(2).
    \22\ See Partial Amendment No. 1 at 5.
