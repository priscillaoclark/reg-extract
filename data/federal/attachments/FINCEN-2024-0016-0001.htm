SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION:

I. Statutory and Regulatory Provisions

    The legislative framework generally referred to as the Bank Secrecy 
Act (BSA) consists of the Currency and Foreign Transactions Reporting 
Act of 1970, as amended by the Uniting and Strengthening America by 
Providing Appropriate Tools Required to Intercept and Obstruct 
Terrorism Act of 2001 (USA PATRIOT Act) \1\ and other legislation, 
including the Anti-Money Laundering Act of 2020 (AML Act).\2\ The BSA 
is codified at 12 U.S.C. 1829b, 1951-1960 and 31 U.S.C. 5311-5314, 
5316-5336, including notes thereto, with implementing regulations at 31 
CFR chapter X.
---------------------------------------------------------------------------

    \1\ USA PATRIOT Act, Pub. L. 107-56, 115 Stat. 272 (2001).
    \2\ The AML Act was enacted as Division F, sections 6001-6511, 
of the William M. (Mac) Thornberry National Defense Authorization 
Act for Fiscal Year 2021, Pub. L. 116-283, 134 Stat. 3388.
---------------------------------------------------------------------------

    The BSA authorizes the Secretary of the Treasury (Secretary) to, 
inter alia, require financial institutions to keep records and file 
reports that are determined to have a high degree of usefulness in 
criminal, tax, or regulatory matters, risk assessments or proceedings, 
or in the conduct of intelligence or counter-intelligence activities to 
protect against terrorism, and to implement anti-money laundering and 
countering the financing of terrorism (AML/CFT) programs and compliance 
procedures.\3\ The authority of the Secretary to administer the BSA has 
been delegated to the Director of FinCEN.\4\
---------------------------------------------------------------------------

    \3\ See 31 U.S.C. 5311.
    \4\ Treasury Order 180-01 (Jan. 14, 2020); see also 31 U.S.C. 
310(b)(2)(I) (providing that FinCEN Director ``[a]dminister the 
requirements of subchapter II of chapter 53 of this title, chapter 2 
of title I of Public Law 91-508, and section 21 of the Federal 
Deposit Insurance Act, to the extent delegated such authority by the 
Secretary.'').
---------------------------------------------------------------------------

    Pursuant to 31 U.S.C. 5318(h)(1), financial institutions must 
establish AML/CFT programs to guard against money laundering and the 
financing of terrorism.\5\ Such programs must include, at a minimum: 
(a) the development of internal policies, procedures, and controls; (b) 
the designation of a compliance officer; (c) an ongoing employee 
training program; and (d) an independent audit function to test 
programs.\6\ On March 12, 1993, FinCEN issued regulations, under 
separate statutory authority codified at 31 U.S.C. 5318(a)(2), 
requiring casinos to develop and implement written BSA compliance 
programs.\7\ FinCEN subsequently amended those regulations after 
passage of the USA PATRIOT Act to state that a casino would be ``deemed 
to satisfy the requirements of 31 U.S.C. 5318(h)(1) if it implements 
and maintains'' an AML program, as described in'' 31 CFR 
1021.210(b).\8\
---------------------------------------------------------------------------

    \5\ The provision was added to the BSA through Section 352 of 
the USA PATRIOT Act and authorizes FinCEN to prescribe minimum 
standards for AML programs and to exempt certain financial 
institutions from application of those standards. Section 6101(b) of 
the AML Act amended the provision to include explicit references to 
terrorism finance and to specify the factors that FinCEN must 
consider in prescribing minimum standards.
    \6\ See 31 U.S.C. 5318(h)(1)(A)-(D).
    \7\ See FinCEN, Regulations Regarding Reporting and 
Recordkeeping Requirements by Casinos, 58 FR 13538 (Mar. 12, 1993). 
The regulations were codified at 31 CFR 1021.210. Card clubs are 
included in the casino AML program regulations, and any reference to 
casinos used in BSA regulations includes card clubs, unless 
specifically noted. See 31 CFR 1010.100(t)(5)(iii).
    \8\ See FinCEN, Anti-Money Laundering Programs for Financial 
Institutions, 67 FR 21110 (Apr. 29, 2002). The amended regulations 
are codified at 31 CFR 1021.210(a).
---------------------------------------------------------------------------

    This notice renews the OMB control number associated with the 
casino AML program regulations. This notice is not renewing the OMB 
control numbers associated with other types of financial institutions' 
AML program regulatory requirements, which were renewed as part of a 
separate notice published in April 2024.\9\ This notice also does not 
address any changes to requirements governing AML programs that FinCEN 
is proposing to make pursuant to section 6101(b) of the AML Act; FinCEN 
addressed the paperwork and respondent burden of such proposed changes 
in the notice of proposed rulemaking (NPRM) entitled Anti-Money 
Laundering and Countering the Financing of Terrorism Programs, 
published in July 2024.\10\

------------------------------------------------------------------------
\a\ Estimate based on the American Gaming Association (AGA) ``State of
  Play,'' reporting 486 commercial casinos and 525 Tribal casinos as of
  December 31, 2023 (available at <a href="https://www.americangaming.org/state-of-play/">https://www.americangaming.org/state-of-play/</a>, accessed February 28, 2024). As of December 31, 2022, there
  were also 266 card rooms as published in the AGA's ``State of the
  States'' annual report, p. 16 (available at <a href="https://www.americangaming.org/wpcontent/uploads/2023/05/AGA-State-of-the-States-2023.pdf">https://www.americangaming.org/wpcontent/uploads/2023/05/AGA-State-of-the-States-2023.pdf</a>, accessed February 28, 2024).

    As noted above, 31 U.S.C. 5318(h) mandates that financial 
institutions establish AML/CFT programs to guard against money 
laundering and the financing of terrorism. Such programs must include, 
at a minimum: (a) the development of internal policies, procedures, and 
controls; (b) the designation of a compliance officer; (c) an ongoing 
employee training program; and (d) an independent audit function to 
test programs.\15\
---------------------------------------------------------------------------

    \15\ See 31 U.S.C. 5318(h)(1)(A)-(D).
---------------------------------------------------------------------------

    The AML program regulations for casinos require casinos to 
implement AML programs that are reasonably designed.\16\ The AML 
program must be in writing and must be independently tested for 
compliance with a scope and frequency commensurate with the money 
laundering and terrorist financing risks posed by the products and 
services provided by the casino.\17\
---------------------------------------------------------------------------

    \16\ 31 CFR 1021.210(b)(1).
    \17\ 31 CFR 1021(b)(2); see also 31 CFR 1021.410(b)(10).
---------------------------------------------------------------------------

    In connection with a variety of initiatives FinCEN is undertaking 
to implement the AML Act, FinCEN intends to conduct, in the future, 
additional assessments of the PRA burden associated with BSA 
requirements.

Part 2. Annual PRA Burden and Cost

    For purposes of estimating casino and card rooms' AML program 
annual PRA burden(s), FinCEN continues to view the recordkeeping burden 
associated with AML program requirements as the sum of four discrete 
activities. The scope of the annual PRA burden and cost estimates of 
the casino AML program requirements in this renewal therefore remains 
subdivided as follows: maintaining and updating the AML program 
documentation (Activity A); storing the written AML program (Activity 
B); \18\ producing a copy of the written AML program if requested by 
regulatory examiners or law enforcement (Activity C); and complying 
with the requirements in 31 CFR 1021.210(b)(2)(v) and (vi), which are 
unique to casino AML program regulations (Activity D).\19\
---------------------------------------------------------------------------

    \18\ Pursuant to 31 CFR 1021.210(b)(1) and 31 CFR 
1021.410(b)(10), respectively, a casino's AML program must be 
reduced to writing, and the casino must retain a copy of the 
program.
    \19\ Pursuant to 31 CFR 1021.210(b)(2)(v), a casino's AML 
program must include procedures for using all available information 
to determine: (i) when required by 31 CFR Chapter X, a person's 
name, address, social security number, and other information, and 
verification of the same; (ii) the occurrence of any transaction or 
pattern of transactions required to be reported pursuant to 31 CFR 
1021.320; and (iii) whether any record described in subpart D of 
part 1010 of chapter X must be made and retained. Pursuant to 31 CFR 
1021.210(b)(2)(vi), casinos with automated data processing systems 
must implement AML programs that provide for the use of automated 
programs to aid in assuring compliance.
---------------------------------------------------------------------------

    For purposes of estimating the casino AML program annual PRA 
burden, FinCEN continues to estimate the hourly burden per activity 
using the same burden estimates that were used in the 2020 notice to 
renew the OMB control number for the casino AML program 
requirements.\20\
---------------------------------------------------------------------------

    \20\ See supra note 14.
---------------------------------------------------------------------------

    <bullet> Activity A--FinCEN continues to estimate the incremental 
annual PRA burden of maintaining and updating a written AML program at 
an average of one hour per casino, consistent with the burden estimate 
in the 2020 renewal of this OMB control number and in the renewal of 
the AML program requirements for other types of financial institutions 
in 2024.\21\
---------------------------------------------------------------------------

    \21\ See supra note 9.
---------------------------------------------------------------------------

    <bullet> Activity B--Required written AML programs are stored as 
electronic files. The estimated annual burden (five minutes per 
financial institution) represents the administrative burden involved in 
processing the storage of the written program. FinCEN continues to 
estimate the incremental annual PRA burden of storing an AML program at 
an average of five minutes per casino.
    <bullet> Activity C--Producing the written AML program to 
regulatory or law enforcement agencies, upon their request, is 
performed electronically. Historically, FinCEN has estimated the annual 
burden of producing the written program at an average of five minutes 
per financial institution. This estimated annual burden represents the 
administrative burden involved in producing the program upon request 
once per year. FinCEN continues to estimate the incremental annual PRA 
burden of producing an AML program at five minutes per casino.
    <bullet> Activity D--In the 2020 renewal of the casino AML program 
regulations, FinCEN estimated the annual PRA burden to comply with 31 
CFR 1021.210(b)(2)(v) and (vi) would average approximately 99 hours per 
casino. FinCEN continues to estimate that the annual incremental PRA 
burden of complying with these requirements is 99 hours per casino.\22\
---------------------------------------------------------------------------

    \22\ If it becomes necessary to consider how to allocate the 
burden of Activity D between the activities required by 31 CFR 
1021.210(b)(2)(v) and (vi) respectively, FinCEN is of the opinion 
that (vi) contributes a de minimis burden to the activity. Pursuant 
to 31 CFR 1021.210(b)(2)(vi), ``[f]or casinos that have automated 
data processing systems,'' the casino's AML program must provide for 
``the use of automated programs to aid in assuring compliance.'' 
While this may have been a measurable incremental source of burden 
in the earlier stages of businesses adopting automated compliance 
programs (particularly in the casino industry), FinCEN believes such 
programs have since been widely adopted for a variety of sound 
business reasons independent of FinCEN regulatory requirements. As 
these programs are now effectively ubiquitous in the industry, 
FinCEN is of the opinion that they would continue to be used in the 
absence of the requirement in 31 CFR 1021.210(b)(2)(vi). However, 
FinCEN solicits comments on whether this is the case, and whether as 
a result the burden added by (vi) should be regarded as de minimis.
---------------------------------------------------------------------------

    Under these assumptions, FinCEN's estimate of the annual 
incremental PRA burden is 127,912 hours, as detailed in table 2 below.
