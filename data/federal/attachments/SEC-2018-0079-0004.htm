SECURITIES AND EXCHANGE COMMISSION

[SEC File No. 270-270, OMB Control No. 3235-0292]


Proposed Collection; Comment Request; Extension: Form F-6-
Registration Statement

    Upon Written Request Copies Available From: Securities and Exchange 
Commission, Office of FOIA Services, 100 F Street NE, Washington, DC 
20549-2736.

    Notice is hereby given that, pursuant to the Paperwork Reduction 
Act of 1995 (44 U.S.C. 3501 et seq.), the Securities and Exchange 
Commission (``Commission'') is soliciting comments on the collection of 
information summarized below. The Commission

[[Page 26977]]

plans to submit this existing collection of information to the Office 
of Management and Budget for approval.
    Form F-6 (17 CFR 239.36) is a form used by foreign companies to 
register the offer and sale of American Depositary Receipts (ADRs) 
under the Securities Act of 1933 (15 U.S.C. 77a et seq.). Form F-6 
requires disclosure of information regarding the terms of the 
depository bank, fees charged, and a description of the ADRs. No 
special information regarding the foreign company is required to be 
prepared or disclosed, although the foreign company must be one which 
periodically furnishes information to the Commission. The information 
is needed to ensure that investors in ADRs have full disclosure of 
information concerning the deposit agreement and the foreign company. 
Form F-6 takes approximately 1.35 hour per response to prepare and is 
filed by 366 respondents annually. We estimate that 25% of the 1.35 
hour per response (0.338 hours) is prepared by the filer for a total 
annual reporting burden of 124 hours (0.338 hours per response x 366 
responses).
    Written comments are invited on: (a) whether this proposed 
collection of information is necessary for the proper performance of 
the functions of the agency, including whether the information will 
have practical utility; (b) the accuracy of the agency's estimate of 
the burden imposed by the collection of information; (c) ways to 
enhance the quality, utility, and clarity of the information collected; 
and (d) ways to minimize the burden of the collection of information on 
respondents, including through the use of automated collection 
techniques or other forms of information technology. Consideration will 
be given to comments and suggestions submitted in writing within 60 
days of this publication by June 17, 2024.
    An agency may not conduct or sponsor, and a person is not required 
to respond to, a collection of information unless it displays a 
currently valid control number.
    Please direct your written comment to David Bottom, Director/Chief 
Information Officer, Securities and Exchange Commission, c/o John 
Pezzullo, 100 F Street NE, Washington, DC 20549 or send an email to:
