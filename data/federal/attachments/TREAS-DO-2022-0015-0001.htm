Notice of CFIUS Action

    The Committee, taking into consideration the factors identified on 
the Committee's section of the Department of the Treasury website, has 
determined, under the authority of section 721 of the Defense 
Production Act of 1950, as amended, and 31 CFR 800.1001(a), that: (1) 
Australia has established and is effectively utilizing a robust process 
to analyze foreign investments for national security risks and to 
facilitate coordination with the United States on matters relating to 
investment security; and (2) Canada has established and is effectively 
utilizing a robust process to analyze foreign investments for national 
security risks and to facilitate coordination with the United States on 
matters relating to investment security.
    This determination satisfies the second criterion in the definition 
of excepted foreign state under 31 CFR 800.218 with respect to 
Australia and Canada. Therefore, Australia and Canada are and will 
remain excepted foreign states absent further Committee action and 
notice in the Federal Register.

Larry McDonald,
Acting Assistant Secretary for International Markets.
