    General Description of Collection: FDIC regulations (12 CFR 333.2) 
prohibit any insured State nonmember bank from changing the general 
character of its business without the prior written consent of the 
FDIC. The exercise of trust powers by a bank is usually considered a 
change in the general character of a bank's business if the bank did 
not exercise those powers previously. Therefore, unless a bank is 
currently exercising trust powers, it must file a formal application to 
obtain the FDIC's written consent to exercise trust powers. State 
banking authorities, not the FDIC, grant trust powers to their banks. 
The FDIC merely consents to the exercise of such powers. Applicants use 
form FDIC 6200/09 to obtain FDIC's consent. There is no change in the 
methodology or substance of this information collection. The decrease 
in total estimated annual burden from 72 hours in 2022 to 48 hours 
currently is due to decrease in the number of applications for 
expedited processing from eligible depository institutions.
    2. Title: Joint Standards for Assessing Diversity Policies and 
Practices.
    OMB Number: 3064-0200.
    Form Number: 2710/05--Diversity Self-Assessment (paper form), 2710/
06--Diversity Self-Assessment (electronic form).
    Affected Public: Insured State nonmember banks, and insured State 
savings associations.

    General Description of Collection: Section 342 of the Dodd-Frank 
Wall Street Reform and Consumer Protection Act of 2010 (the Act) 
required the Office of the Comptroller of the Currency, the Federal 
Reserve System, the FDIC, the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau, and 
the Securities and Exchange Commission each to establish an Office of 
Minority and Women Inclusion (OMWI) to be responsible for all matters 
of the agency relating to diversity in management, employment, and 
business activities. The Act also instructed each OMWI director to 
develop standards for assessing the diversity policies and practices of 
entities regulated by the agency. The agencies worked together to 
develop joint standards (Joint Standards) and, on June 10, 2015, they 
jointly published in the Federal Register the ``Final Interagency 
Policy Statement Establishing Joint Standards for Assessing the 
Diversity Policies and Practices of Entities Regulated by the 
Agencies'' (Policy Statement). The Policy Statement includes Joint 
Standards that cover ``Practices to Promote Transparency of 
Organizational Diversity and Inclusion.'' These Joint Standards 
contemplate that a regulated entity is transparent about its diversity 
and inclusion activities by making certain information available to the 
public annually on its websites or through other appropriate 
communications methods, in a manner reflective of the entity's size and 
other characteristics. The specific information referenced in these 
standards is (a) the entity's diversity and inclusion strategic plan; 
(b) its policy on its commitment to diversity and inclusion; (c) its 
progress toward achieving diversity and inclusion in its workforce and 
procurement activities; and (d) opportunities available at the entity 
that promote diversity. In addition, the Policy Statement includes 
Joint Standards that address ``Entities' Self-Assessment.'' The Joint 
Standards for Entities' Self-Assessment envision that a regulated 
entity, in a manner reflective of its size and other characteristics, 
(a) conducts annually a voluntary self-assessment of its diversity 
policies and practices; (b) monitors and evaluates its performance 
under its diversity policies and practices on an ongoing basis; (c) 
provides information pertaining to its self-assessment to the OMWI 
Director of its primary Federal financial regulator; and (d) publishes 
information pertaining to its efforts with respect to the Joint 
Standards. There is no change in the methodology or substance of this 
information collection. The decrease in total estimated annual burden 
from 1560 hours in 2022 to 991 hours currently is due to the 
expectation that most repeat respondent banks would use the copy/clone 
feature in Financial Institution Diversity-Self Assessment (FID-SA) for 
their future submissions, thereby saving a substantial amount of 
response time and reducing their overall burden hours.

    OMB Number: 3064-0214.
    Form Number: None.
    Affected Public: Businesses or other for-profit.

    General Description of Collection: The Office of the Comptroller of 
the Currency, Board of Governors of the Federal Reserve System, and the 
FDIC are issuing a notice of proposed rulemaking (the proposed rule) 
that would require a banking organization to notify its primary Federal 
regulator upon the occurrence of a significant computer security 
incident. This notification requirement is intended to serve as an 
early alert to a banking organization's primary Federal regulator and 
is not intended to include an assessment of the incident. The proposed 
rule would allow a banking organization to authorize or contract with a 
bank service provider to allow the bank service provider to make the 
relevant notifications to the banking organization's primary Federal 
regulator on the banking organization's behalf. Moreover, a bank 
service provider as defined herein and in accordance with the Bank 
Service Company Act (BSCA) would be required to notify affected banking 
organization customers within four hours of when it experiences a 
computer-security incident that it reasonably believes could disrupt, 
degrade, or impair services provided subject to the BSCA for four or 
more hours. ``Bank service providers'' would include both bank service 
companies and third-party service providers, under the BSCA. There is 
no change in the methodology or substance of this information 
collection. The increase in total estimated annual burden from 2,694 in 
2022 to 2,748 currently is due to a change in the estimated number or 
respondents.

Request for Comment

    Comments are invited on: (a) whether the collections of information 
are necessary for the proper performance of the FDIC's functions, 
including whether the information has practical utility; (b) the 
accuracy of the estimates of the burden of the information collections,

[[Page 87879]]

including the validity of the methodology and assumptions used; (c) 
ways to enhance the quality, utility, and clarity of the information to 
be collected; and (d) ways to minimize the burden of the collections of 
information on respondents, including through the use of automated 
collection techniques or other forms of information technology. All 
comments will become a matter of public record.

Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation.
