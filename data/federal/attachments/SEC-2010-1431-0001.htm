III. Commission's Findings and Order Granting Accelerated Approval of 
Proposed Plan Amendment

    The Commission finds that the proposed Joint-SRO Plan amendment is 
consistent with the requirements of the Act and the rules and 
regulations thereunder.\4\ Specifically, the Commission believes that 
the proposed amendment, which permits BYX to become a participant to 
the Joint-SRO Plan, is consistent with the requirements of Section 11A 
of the Act, and Rule 608 of Regulation NMS. The Plan establishes 
appropriate procedures for market centers to follow in making their 
monthly reports required pursuant to Rule 605 of Regulation NMS, 
available to the public in a uniform, readily accessible, and usable 
electronic format. The proposed amendment to include BYX as a 
participant in the Joint-SRO Plan will contribute to the maintenance of 
fair and orderly markets and remove impediments to and perfect the 
mechanisms of a national market system by facilitating the uniform 
public disclosure of order execution information by all market centers.
---------------------------------------------------------------------------

    \4\ In approving this proposed Joint-SRO Plan amendment, the 
Commission has considered the proposal's impact on efficiency, 
competition, and capital formation. 15 U.S.C. 78c(f).
---------------------------------------------------------------------------

    The Commission finds good cause to grant temporary effectiveness to 
the proposed Joint-SRO Plan amendment, for 120 days, until January 18, 
2011. The Commission believes that it is necessary and appropriate in 
the public interest, for the maintenance of fair and orderly markets, 
to remove impediments to, and perfect mechanisms of, a national market 
system to allow BYX to become a participant in the Joint-SRO Plan. On 
August 13, 2010, the Commission granted the application of BYX for 
registration as a national securities exchange.\5\ One of the 
conditions to operation of the BYX Exchange is participation in 
national market system plans, including the Joint-SRO Plan.\6\ As a 
Plan participant, BYX would have timely information on the Plan 
procedures as they are formulated and modified by the participants. The 
Commission finds, therefore, that granting temporary effectiveness of 
the proposed Joint-SRO Plan amendment is appropriate and consistent 
with Section 11A of the Act.\7\
---------------------------------------------------------------------------

    \5\ See Securities Exchange Act Release No. 62716 (August 13, 
2010), 75 FR 51295 (August 19, 2010).
    \6\ Id. at 51305.
    \7\ 15 U.S.C. 78k-1.
---------------------------------------------------------------------------

IV. Conclusion

    It is therefore ordered, pursuant to Section 11A of the Act \8\ and 
Rule 608 of Regulation NMS,\9\ that the proposed Joint-SRO Plan 
amendment is approved for 120 days, through January 18, 2011.
