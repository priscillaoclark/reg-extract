I. Self-Regulatory Organization's Statement of the Terms of Substance 
of the Proposed Rule Change

    The Exchange proposes to amend its Rules at Options 7, Section 6, 
Ports and Other Services.\3\
---------------------------------------------------------------------------

    \3\ The Exchange initially filed the proposed pricing changes on 
November 28, 2023 (SR-MRX-2023-23) to be effective on December 1, 
2023. On December 5, 2023, the Exchange withdrew SR-MRX-2023-23 and 
replaced it with SR-MRX-2023-25. On January 16, 2023, the Exchange 
withdrew SR-MRX-2023-25 and submitted SR-MRX-2024-02. On March 7, 
2024, the Exchange withdrew SR-MRX-2024-02 and submitted this 
filing.

Reference Room.

II. Self-Regulatory Organization's Statement of the Purpose of, and 
Statutory Basis for, the Proposed Rule Change

    In its filing with the Commission, the Exchange included statements 
concerning the purpose of and basis for the proposed rule change and 
discussed any comments it received on the proposed rule change. The 
text of these statements may be examined at the places specified in 
Item IV below. The Exchange has prepared summaries, set forth in 
sections A, B, and C below, of the most significant aspects of such 
statements.

[[Page 21095]]

A. Self-Regulatory Organization's Statement of the Purpose of, and 
Statutory Basis for, the Proposed Rule Change

1. Purpose
    The Exchange proposes to amend Options 7, Section 6, Ports and 
Other Services. Specifically, the Exchange proposes to amend the 
monthly caps for SQF Ports \4\ and SQF Purge Ports.\5\ The Exchange 
also proposes to remove unnecessary rule text from Options 7, Section 6 
related to a technology migration. Both changes are explained below.
---------------------------------------------------------------------------

    \4\ ``Specialized Quote Feed'' or ``SQF'' is an interface that 
allows Market Makers to connect, send, and receive messages related 
to quotes, Immediate-or-Cancel Orders, and auction responses to the 
Exchange. Features include the following: (1) options symbol 
directory messages (e.g., underlying and complex instruments); (2) 
system event messages (e.g., start of trading hours messages and 
start of opening); (3) trading action messages (e.g., halts and 
resumes); (4) execution messages; (5) quote messages; (6) Immediate-
or-Cancel Order messages; (7) risk protection triggers and purge 
notifications; (8) opening imbalance messages; (9) auction 
notifications; and (10) auction responses. The SQF Purge Interface 
only receives and notifies of purge requests from the Market Maker. 
Market Makers may only enter interest into SQF in their assigned 
options series. Immediate-or-Cancel Orders entered into SQF are not 
subject to the (i) Order Price Protection, Market Order Spread 
Protection, and Size Limitation Protection in Options 3, Section 
15(a)(1)(A), (1)(B), and (2)(B) respectively, for single leg orders, 
or (ii) Complex Order Price Protection as defined in Options 3, 
Section 16(c)(1) for Complex Orders. See Supplementary Material 
.03(c) to Options 3, Section 7.
    \5\ SQF Purge is a specific port for the SQF interface that only 
receives and notifies of purge requests from the Market Maker. 
Dedicated SQF Purge Ports enable Market Makers to seamlessly manage 
their ability to remove their quotes in a swift manner. The SQF 
Purge Port is designed to assist Market Makers in the management of, 
and risk control over, their quotes. Market Makers may utilize a 
purge port to reduce uncertainty and to manage risk by purging all 
quotes in their assigned options series. Of note, Market Makers may 
only enter interest into SQF in their assigned options series. 
Additionally, the SQF Purge Port may be utilized by a Market Maker 
in the event that the Member has a system issue and determines to 
purge its quotes from the order book.
---------------------------------------------------------------------------

    Today, MRX assesses $1,250 per port, per month for an SQF Port as 
well as an SQF Purge Port. Today, MRX waives one SQF Port fee per 
Market Maker per month. Also, today, SQF Ports and SQF Purge Ports are 
subject to a monthly cap of $17,500, which cap is applicable to Market 
Makers.
    At this time, the Exchange proposes to increase the SQF Port and 
SQF Purge Port monthly cap fee of $17,500 per month to $27,500 per 
month.\6\ The Exchange is not amending the $1,250 per port, per month 
SQF Port and SQF Purge Port fees and the Exchange would continue to 
waive one SQF Port fee per Market Maker per month. As is the case 
today, the Exchange would not assess a Member an SQF Port or SQF Purge 
Port fee beyond the monthly cap once the Member has exceeded the 
monthly cap for the respective month.
---------------------------------------------------------------------------

    \6\ Today, 63% of Market Makers cap their SQF Ports and SQF 
Purge Ports on MRX. The Exchange notes that of the Market Makers 
currently registered on MRX, there is a mix of size of Market Makers 
that cap.
---------------------------------------------------------------------------

    Despite increasing the monthly cap for SQF Ports and SQF Purge 
Ports from $17,500 per month to $27,500 per month, the Exchange will 
continue to offer Members the opportunity to cap their SQF Port and SQF 
Purge Port fees so that they would not be assessed these fees beyond 
the cap.
    Pursuant to Supplementary Material .03(c) to Options 3, Section 7, 
Market Makers may only enter interest into SQF in their assigned 
options series. Pursuant to Supplementary Material .03(c) to Options 3, 
Section 7, the SQF interface allows Market Makers to connect, send, and 
receive messages related to quotes, Immediate-or-Cancel Orders, and 
auction responses to the Exchange. An MRX Market Maker requires only 
one SQF Port to submit quotes in its assigned options series into MRX. 
An SQF Purge is a specific port for the SQF interface that only 
receives and notifies of purge requests from the Market Maker. An MRX 
Market Maker may submit all quotes through one SQF Port and utilize one 
SQF Purge Port to view its purge requests. While a Market Maker may 
elect to obtain multiple SQF Ports and SQF Purge Ports to organize its 
business,\7\ only one SQF Port and SQF Purge Port is necessary for a 
Market Maker to fulfill its regulatory quoting obligations.\8\
---------------------------------------------------------------------------

    \7\ For example, a Market Maker may desire to utilize multiple 
SQF Ports for accounting purposes, to measure performance, for 
regulatory reasons or other determinations that are specific to that 
Member.
    \8\ MRX Market Makers have various regulatory requirements as 
provided for in Options 2, Section 4. Additionally, MRX Market 
Makers have certain quoting requirements with respect to their 
assigned options series as provided in Options 2, Section 5. SQF 
Ports are the only quoting protocol available on MRX and only Market 
Makers may utilize SQF Ports. The same is true for SQF Purge Ports.
---------------------------------------------------------------------------

    The Exchange proposes to remove the italicized language in Options 
7, Section 6 related to a technology migration that took place in 2022. 
In 2022, MRX filed a pricing change \9\ to permit Members to request 
certain duplicative ports at no additional cost, from November 1, 2022 
through December 30, 2022, to facilitate a technology migration. The 
rule text related to the 2022 technology migration is no longer 
necessary because the migration is complete and the pricing is no 
longer applicable. At this time, the Exchange proposes to remove this 
rule text.
---------------------------------------------------------------------------

    \9\ See Securities Exchange Act Release No. 96120 (October 21, 
2022), 87 FR 65105 (October 27, 2022) (SR-MRX-2022-21) (Notice of 
Filing and Immediate Effectiveness of Proposed Rule Change To Amend 
Options 7 in Connection With a Technology Migration).
---------------------------------------------------------------------------

2. Statutory Basis
    The Exchange believes that its proposal is consistent with Section 
6(b) of the Act,\10\ in general, and furthers the objectives of 
Sections 6(b)(4) and 6(b)(5) of the Act,\11\ in particular, in that it 
provides for the equitable allocation of reasonable dues, fees, and 
other charges among members and issuers and other persons using any 
facility, and is not designed to permit unfair discrimination between 
customers, issuers, brokers, or dealers.
---------------------------------------------------------------------------

    \10\ 15 U.S.C. 78f(b).
    \11\ 15 U.S.C. 78f(b)(4) and (5).
---------------------------------------------------------------------------

    The proposed pricing change to increase the SQF Port and SQF Purge 
Port monthly cap from $17,500 per month to $27,500 per month is 
reasonable because despite the increase in the monthly cap, the 
Exchange will continue to offer Members the opportunity to cap their 
SQF Port and SQF Purge Port fees so that they would not be assessed 
these fees beyond the cap. Additionally, an MRX Market Maker requires 
only one SQF Port to submit quotes in its assigned options series into 
MRX. An MRX Market Maker may submit all quotes through one SQF Port and 
utilize one SQF Purge Port to view its purge requests. While a Market 
Maker may elect to obtain multiple SQF Ports and SQF Purge Ports to 
organize its business,\12\ only one SQF Port and SQF Purge Port is 
necessary for a Market Maker to fulfill its regulatory quoting 
obligations.\13\ Members may choose a greater number of SQF Ports or 
SQF Purge Ports, beyond one port, depending on that Member's particular 
business model. Additionally, the Exchange believes that the caps are 
reasonable for two reasons.
---------------------------------------------------------------------------

    \12\ For example, a Market Maker or may desire to utilize 
multiple SQF Ports for accounting purposes, to measure performance, 
for regulatory reasons or other determinations that are specific to 
that Member.
    \13\ MRX Market Makers have various regulatory requirements as 
provided for in Options 2, Section 4. Additionally, MRX Market 
Makers have certain quoting requirements with respect to their 
assigned options series as provided in Options 2, Section 5. SQF 
Ports are the only quoting protocol available on MRX and only Market 
Makers may utilize SQF Ports.
---------------------------------------------------------------------------

    First, SQF Ports are a secure method for Market Makers to submit 
quotes into the Exchange's match engine and for the Exchange to send 
messages related to those quotes to Market Makers. MRX must manage the 
security and message

[[Page 21096]]

traffic, among other things, for each port. Utilizing the cap to manage 
a Market Maker's costs while also managing the quantity of SQF Ports 
issued on MRX has led the Exchange to select $27,500 as the amended 
monthly cap for SQF Ports and SQF Purge Ports. By capping the ports at 
a different level, the Exchange is considering the message traffic and 
message rates associated with the current number of outstanding ports 
and its ability to process messages. The ability to have a cap and 
amend that cap permits the Exchange to scale its needs with respect to 
processing messages in an efficient manner. The Exchange notes that 
Cboe Exchange, Inc. (``Cboe'') limits usage on each port and assesses 
fees for incremental usage.\14\
---------------------------------------------------------------------------

    \14\ Each Cboe Binary Order Entry (``BOE'') or FIX Logical Port 
incur the logical port fee indicated when used to enter up to 70,000 
orders per trading day per logical port as measured on average in a 
single month. For each incremental usage of up to 70,000 per day per 
logical port will incur an additional logical port fee of $800 per 
month. BOE or FIX Logical Ports provide users the ability to enter 
order/quotes. See Cboe's Fees Schedule.
---------------------------------------------------------------------------

    Second, the Exchange notes that multiple ports are not necessary, 
however, to the extent that some Market Makers elect to obtain multiple 
ports, the Exchange is offering to cap their total port cost at $27,500 
per month. MRX believes the existence of a cap allows for efficiencies 
and permits Market Makers to increase their number of ports beyond the 
cap. The cap levels the playing field by allowing those Market Makers 
that want to obtain a larger number of ports to do so with the 
certainty of a fee cap. Without the cap, MRX Market Makers may pay more 
to obtain multiple ports on MRX. BOX Exchange LLC (``BOX'') assesses 
$1,000 per month for all SAIL Ports for Market Making and $500 per 
month per port up to 5 ports for order entry and $150 per month for 
each additional port.\15\ MIAX's MIAX Express Interface (``MEI'') Fee 
levels are based on a tiered fee structure based on the Market Maker's 
total monthly executed volume during the relevant month.\16\
---------------------------------------------------------------------------

    \15\ See BOX's Fee Schedule.
    \16\ MEI is a connection to MIAX systems that enables Market 
Makers to submit simple and complex electronic quotes to MIAX. MIAX 
caps its MEI Ports. For these Monthly MIAX MEI Fees levels, if the 
Market Maker's total monthly executed volume during the relevant 
month is less than 0.060% of the total monthly executed volume 
reported by OCC in the market maker account type for MIAX-listed 
option classes for that month, then the fee will be $14,500 instead 
of the fee otherwise applicable to such level. See MIAX's Fee 
Schedule.
---------------------------------------------------------------------------

    The number of ports that members choose to purchase varies widely. 
Today, on MRX, 2 Market Makers have 1 SQF Ports/SQF Purge Ports, no 
Market Makers have 2-5 SQF Ports/SQF Purge Ports, 2 Market Makers have 
between 6-10 SQF Ports/SQF Purge Ports, and 6 Market Makers have more 
than 10 SQF Ports/SQF Purge Ports. The chart below represents the 
number of SQF Ports and SQF Purge Ports that are subscribed to by 
members across the six Nasdaq affiliated options markets.
[GRAPHIC] [TIFF OMITTED] TN26MR24.008

    The Exchange's proposed pricing change to increase the SQF Port and 
SQF Purge Port monthly cap from $17,500 per month to $27,500 per month 
is equitable and not unfairly discriminatory because the Exchange would 
uniformly not assess any Market Makers that exceeded the proposed 
monthly cap any SQF Port and SQF Purge Port fees for that month beyond 
the cap. Market Makers are the only market participants that are 
assessed SQF Port and SQF Purge Port fees because they are the only 
market participants that are permitted to quote on the Exchange. SQF 
Ports and SQF Purge Ports are only utilized in the Market Maker's 
assigned options series. The following chart represents the 
classification of MRX Members and the percentage of Market Makers.

[[Page 21097]]

[GRAPHIC] [TIFF OMITTED] TN26MR24.009

    Unlike other market participants, Market Makers are subject to 
market making and quoting obligations.\17\ These liquidity providers 
are critical market participants in that they are the only market 
participants that provide liquidity to MRX on a continuous basis. In 
addition, the Exchange notes that Lead Market Makers are required to 
submit quotes in the Opening Process to open an options series.\18\ 
Market Makers are subject to a number of fees, unlike other market 
participants. Market Makers pay separate Membership Fees,\19\ and CMM 
Trading Right Fees,\20\ in addition to other fees paid by other market 
participants. Providing Market Makers a means to cap their cost related 
to quoting and enabling all Market Makers to acquire SQF Ports and SQF 
Purge Ports at no cost beyond a certain dollar amount enables these 
market participants to provide the necessary liquidity to MRX at lower 
costs. Therefore, because Market Makers fulfill a unique role on the 
Exchange, are the only market participant required to submit quotes as 
part of their obligations to operate on the Exchange, and, in light of 
that role, they are eligible for certain incentives. The proposed SQF 
Port and SQF Purge Fee cap is designed to continue to incent Market 
Makers to quote on MRX, thereby promoting liquidity, quote competition, 
and trading opportunities.
---------------------------------------------------------------------------

    \17\ See Options 2, Sections 4 and 5.
    \18\ See Options 3, Section 8.
    \19\ See Options 7, Section 5, E.
    \20\ See Options 7, Section 5, F.
---------------------------------------------------------------------------

    In 2022, NYSE Arca, Inc. (``NYSE Arca'') proposed to restructure 
fees relating to OTPs for Market Makers.\21\ In that rule change,\22\ 
NYSE Arca argued that,
---------------------------------------------------------------------------

    \21\ See Securities Exchange Act Release No. 95412 (June 23, 
2022), 87 FR 38786 (June 29, 2022) (SR-NYSEArca-2022-36). NYSE Arca 
proposed to increase both the monthly fee per Market Maker OTP and 
the number of issues covered by each additional OTP because, among 
other reasons, the number of issues traded on the Exchange has 
increased significantly in recent years.
    \22\ Id at 38788.

    Market Makers serve a unique and important function on the 
Exchange (and other options exchanges) given the quote-driven nature 
of options markets. Because options exchanges rely on actively 
quoting Market Makers to facilitate a robust marketplace that 
attracts order flow, options exchanges must attract and retain 
Market Makers, including by setting competitive Market Maker permit 
fees. Stated otherwise, changes to Market Maker permit fees can have 
a direct effect on the ability of an exchange to compete for order 
flow. The Exchange also believes that the number of options 
exchanges on which Market Makers can effect option transactions also 
ensures competition in the marketplace and constrains the ability of 
exchanges to charge supracompetitive fees for access to its market 
---------------------------------------------------------------------------
by Market Makers.

    Further, NYSE ARCA noted that,\23\
---------------------------------------------------------------------------

    \23\ Id at 38790.

    The Exchange further believes that its ability to set Market 
Maker permit fees is constrained by competitive forces based on the 
fact that Market Makers can, and have, chosen to terminate their 
status as a Market Maker if they deem Market Maker permit fees to be 
unreasonable or excessive. Specifically, the Exchange notes that a 
BOX participant modified its access to BOX in connection with the 
implementation of a proposed change to BOX's Market Maker permit 
fees. The Exchange has also observed that another options exchange 
group experienced decreases in market share following its proposed 
modifications of its access fees (including Market Maker trading 
permit fees), suggesting that market participants (including Market 
Makers) are sensitive to changes in exchanges' access fees and may 
respond by shifting their order flow elsewhere if they deem the fees 
to be unreasonable or excessive.
    There is no requirement, regulatory or otherwise, that any 
Market Maker connect to and access any (or all of) the available 
options exchanges. The Exchange also is not aware of any reason why 
a Market Maker could not cease being a permit holder in response to 
unreasonable price increases. The Exchange does not assess any 
termination fee for a Market Maker to drop its OTP, nor is the 
Exchange aware of any other costs that would be incurred by a Market 
Maker to do so.

    The Exchange likewise believes that its ability to cap SQF Port and 
SQF Purge fees is constrained by competitive forces and that its 
proposed modifications to the SQF Port and SQF Purge Fee cap is 
reasonably designed in consideration of the competitive environment in 
which the Exchange operates, by balancing the value of the enhanced 
benefits available to Market Makers due to the current level of 
activity on the Exchange with a fee structure that will continue to 
incent Market Makers to support increased liquidity, quote competition, 
and trading opportunities on the Exchange, for the benefit of all 
market participants.

B. Self-Regulatory Organization's Statement on Burden on Competition

    The Exchange does not believe that the proposed rule change will 
impose any burden on competition not

[[Page 21098]]

necessary or appropriate in furtherance of the purposes of the Act.
Intermarket Competition
    The proposal does not impose an undue burden on intermarket 
competition. The Exchange believes its proposal remains competitive 
with other options markets who also offer order entry protocols. The 
Exchange notes that it operates in a highly competitive market in which 
market participants can readily favor competing venues if they deem fee 
levels at a particular venue to be excessive. The chart below shows the 
February 2024 market share for multiply listed options by exchange. Of 
the 17 operating options exchanges, none currently has more than a 
17.6% market share. Customers widely distribute their transactions 
across exchanges according to their business needs and the ability of 
each exchange to meet those needs through technology, liquidity and 
functionality.
[GRAPHIC] [TIFF OMITTED] TN26MR24.010

    Market share is the percentage of volume on a particular exchange 
relative to the total volume across all exchanges, and indicates the 
amount of order flow directed to that exchange. High levels of market 
share enhance the value of trading and ports.
    In such an environment, the Exchange must continually adjust its 
fees to remain competitive with other exchanges. Because competitors 
are free to modify their own fees in response, and because market 
participants may readily adjust their order routing practices, the 
Exchange believes that the degree to which fee changes in this market 
may impose any burden on competition is extremely limited.
    Other exchanges amended certain costs attributed to Market 
Makers.\24\ In 2022, MRX proposed a monthly cap for SQF Ports and SQF 
Purge Ports of 17,500.\25\ MRX noted in its rule change that, ``Only 
one SQF quote protocol is required for an MRX Market Maker to submit 
quotes into MRX and to meet its regulatory requirements.'' \26\
---------------------------------------------------------------------------

    \24\ See Securities Exchange Act Release No. 95412 (June 23, 
2022), 87 FR 38786 (June 29, 2022) (SR-NYSEArca-2022-36).
    \25\ See Securities Exchange Act No. 96824(February 7, 2023), 88 
FR 8975 (February 10, 2023) (SR-MRX-2023-05) (Notice of Filing and 
Immediate Effectiveness of Proposed Rule Change To Amend MRX Options 
7, Section 6).
    \26\ Id at 8976.
---------------------------------------------------------------------------

    If the Commission were to apply a different standard of review this 
proposal than it applied to other exchange fee filings, where Market 
Maker fees were increased and port fee caps were established, it would 
create a burden on competition such that it would impair MRX's ability 
to compete among other options markets. Additionally, BOX assesses 
$1,000 per month for all SAIL Ports for Market Making and $500 per 
month per port up to 5 ports for order entry and $150 per month for 
each additional port.\27\ MIAX's MEI Fee levels are based on a tiered 
fee structure based on the Market Maker's total monthly executed volume 
during the relevant month.\28\
---------------------------------------------------------------------------

    \27\ See BOX's Fee Schedule.
    \28\ MEI is a connection to MIAX systems that enables Market 
Makers to submit simple and complex electronic quotes to MIAX. MIAX 
caps its MEI Ports. For these Monthly MIAX MEI Fees levels, if the 
Market Maker's total monthly executed volume during the relevant 
month is less than 0.060% of the total monthly executed volume 
reported by OCC in the market maker account type for MIAX-listed 
option classes for that month, then the fee will be $14,500 instead 
of the fee otherwise applicable to such level. See MIAX's Fee 
Schedule.
---------------------------------------------------------------------------

    If the Commission were to apply a different standard of review this 
proposal than it applied to other exchange fee filings, where Market 
Maker fees were increased and port fee caps were established, it would 
create a burden on competition such that it would impair MRX's ability 
to compete among other options markets.
Intramarket Competition
    The Exchange's proposed pricing change to increase the SQF Port and 
SQF Purge Port monthly cap from $17,500 per month to $27,500 per month 
does not impose an undue burden on competition because the Exchange 
would uniformly not assess any Market Makers that exceeded the proposed 
monthly cap any SQF Port and SQF Purge Port fees for that month beyond 
the cap. Market Makers are the only market participants that are 
assessed SQF Port and SQF Purge Port fees because they are the only 
market participants that are permitted to quote on the Exchange. SQF 
Ports and SQF

[[Page 21099]]

Purge Ports are only utilized in the Market Maker's assigned options 
series. Unlike other market participants, Market Makers are subject to 
market making and quoting obligations.\29\ These liquidity providers 
are critical market participants in that they are the only market 
participants that provide liquidity to MRX on a continuous basis. In 
addition, the Exchange notes that Lead Market Makers are required to 
submit quotes in the Opening Process to open an options series.\30\ 
Market Makers are subject to a number of fees, unlike other market 
participants. Market Makers pay separate Membership Fees,\31\ and CMM 
Trading Right Fees,\32\ in addition to other fees paid by other market 
participants. Providing Market Makers a means to cap their cost related 
to quoting and enabling all Market Makers to acquire SQF Ports and SQF

market participants to provide the necessary liquidity to MRX at lower 
costs. Therefore, because Market Makers fulfill a unique role on the 
Exchange, are the only market participant required to submit quotes as 
part of their obligations to operate on the Exchange, and, in light of 
that role, they are eligible for certain incentives. The proposed SQF 
Port and SQF Purge Fee cap is designed to continue to incent Market 
Makers to quote on MRX, thereby promoting liquidity, quote competition, 
and trading opportunities.

---------------------------------------------------------------------------

    The Exchange's proposal to remove the italicized language in 
Options 7, Section 6 related to a technology migration that took place 
in 2022 does not impose an undue burden on competition because the rule 
text related to the technology migration is no longer necessary because 
the migration is complete and the fees are no longer applicable. No 
Member is subject to the pricing described for the 2022 technology 
migration.

C. Self-Regulatory Organization's Statement on Comments on the Proposed 
Rule Change Received From Members, Participants, or Others
