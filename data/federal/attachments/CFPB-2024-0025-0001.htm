SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION: The CFPB is modifying its Privacy Act System 
of Records Notice (SORN) ``CFPB.027--Emergency Notification System'' to

[[Page 53066]]

update the ``Categories of Records in the System'' and ``Record Source 
Categories'' sections to note that due to the transition to a hybrid 
working environment, collection of personal contact information from 
individuals covered by the system is no longer voluntary as previously 
indicated. While the type and amount of personal contact information 
collected remains the same, the personal contact information is now 
automatically collected from an authoritative human resource system. 
The CFPB has also updated the ``Policies and Practices for Retention 
and Disposal of Records'' section to include a National Archives and 
Records Administration (NARA) approved schedule applicable to the 
records maintained in the system. Additionally, the ``Routine Uses'' 
section has been updated to include sharing with NARA for purposes of 
inspection, in accordance with applicable law. Furthermore, CFPB is 
making non-substantive revisions to the ``Policies and Practices for 
Storage of Records'' to eliminate duplication of the ``Administrative, 
Technical and Physical Safeguards'' section and throughout the SORN to 
align with the Office of Management and Budget's recommended model in 
Circular A-108, appendix II.
    The report of the revised system of records has been submitted to 
the Committee on Oversight and Government Reform of the House of 
Representatives, the Committee on Homeland Security and Governmental 
Affairs of the Senate, and the Office of Management and Budget (OMB), 
pursuant to OMB Circular A-108, ``Federal Agency Responsibilities for 
Review, Reporting, and Publication under the Privacy Act'' (Dec. 
2016),\1\ and the Privacy Act of 1974, 5 U.S.C. 552a(r).
---------------------------------------------------------------------------

    \1\ Although pursuant to section 1017(a)(4)(E) of the Consumer 
Financial Protection Act, Public Law 111-203, the CFPB is not 
required to comply with OMB-issued guidance, it voluntarily follows 
OMB privacy-related guidance as a best practice and to facilitate 
cooperation and collaboration with other agencies.
