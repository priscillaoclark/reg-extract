SECURITIES AND EXCHANGE COMMISSION

[SEC File No. 270-558, OMB Control No. 3235-0617]


Submission for OMB Review; Comment Request; Extension: Rule 433

Upon Written Request Copies Available From: Securities and Exchange 
Commission, Office of FOIA Services, 100 F Street NE, Washington, DC 
20549-2736

    Notice is hereby given that, pursuant to the Paperwork Reduction 
Act of 1995 (44 U.S.C. 3501 et seq.), the Securities and Exchange 
Commission (``Commission'') has submitted to the Office of Management 
and Budget this request for extension of the previously approved 
collection of information discussed below.
    Rule 433 (17 CFR 230.433) governs the use and filing of free 
writing prospectuses under the Securities Act of 1933 (15 U.S.C. 77a et 
seq.). The purpose of Rule 433 is to reduce the restrictions on 
communications that an issuer can make to investors during a registered 
offering of its securities, while maintaining important investor 
protections. A free writing prospectus meeting the conditions of Rule 
433(d)(1) must be filed with the Commission and is publicly available. 
We estimate that it takes approximately 2.44764 hours per response to 
prepare a free writing prospectus and that approximately 20,179 
responses are filed per year for a total internal burden of 49,391 
hours (2.4476 hours per response x 20,179 responses).
    An agency may not conduct or sponsor, and a person is not required 
to respond to, a collection of information unless it displays a 
currently valid control number.
    The public may view background documentation for this information 
collection at the following website: <a href="http://www.reginfo.gov">www.reginfo.gov</a>. Find this 
particular information collection by selecting ``Currently under 30-day 
Review--Open for Public Comments'' or by using the search function. 
Written comments and recommendations for the proposed information 
collection should be sent within 30 days of publication of this notice 
by January 10, 2024 to (i) <a href="http://www.reginfo.gov/public/do/PRAMain">www.reginfo.gov/public/do/PRAMain</a> and (ii) 
David Bottom, Director/Chief Information Officer, Securities and 
Exchange Commission, c/o John Pezzullo, 100 F Street NE, Washington, DC 
20549, or by sending an email to: <a href="/cdn-cgi/l/email-protection#451517041a08242c29272a3d053620266b222a33"><span class="__cf_email__" data-cfemail="9fcfcddec0d2fef6f3fdf0e7dfecfafcb1f8f0e9">[email&#160;protected]</span></a>.

    Dated: December 6, 2023.
Sherry R. Haywood,
Assistant Secretary.
