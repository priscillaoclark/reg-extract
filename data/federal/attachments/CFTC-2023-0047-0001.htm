SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION: 
    Title: Adaptation of Regulations to Incorporate Swaps--Records of 
Transactions; Exclusion of Utility Operations Related Swaps with 
Utility Special Entities from De minimis Threshold for Swaps with 
Special Entities (OMB Control No. 3038-0090). This is a request for 
extension of a currently approved information collection.
    Abstract: Title VII of the Dodd-Frank Wall Street Reform and 
Consumer Protection Act (Dodd-Frank Act, Pub. L. 111-203, 124 Stat. 
1376 (2010)) amended the Commodity Exchange Act (CEA) to establish a 
comprehensive new statutory framework for swaps. These amendments 
required the Commodity Futures Trading Commission (``the Commission'') 
to amend several of its regulations to implement the new framework. The 
information collection obligations imposed by the ``Adaptation of 
Regulations to Incorporate Swaps'' final regulations \2\ remain 
necessary to implement section 721 of the Dodd-Frank Act, which amended 
the definitions of futures commission merchant (``FCM'') and 
introducing broker (``IB'') to permit these intermediaries to trade 
swaps on behalf of customers. They also are necessary to implement 
section 733 of the Dodd-Frank Act which introduced swap execution 
facilities (``SEFs'') as a new trading platform for swaps. As a result 
of the enactment of sections 721 and 733, the Commission needed to 
amend certain recordkeeping regulations (Sec. Sec.  1.31, 1.33, 1.35, 
1.37, and 1.39) so that records of swap transactions are maintained 
analogously to how futures transactions are maintained.
---------------------------------------------------------------------------

    \2\ Adaptation of Regulations to Incorporate Swaps, 77 FR 66288 
(Nov. 2, 2012).
---------------------------------------------------------------------------

    Further, the ``Exclusion of Utility Operations-Related Swaps With 
Utility Special Entities from De Minimis Threshold for Swaps With 
Special Entities'' \3\ regulation amended the Commission's swap dealer 
definition to permit a person to exclude ``utility operations-related 
swaps'' with ``utility special entities'' in their de minimis threshold 
calculations. The regulation requires a person claiming the exclusion 
to maintain, in accordance with Commission regulation 1.31, any written 
representations that the person receives from utility special entities 
related to this exclusion.
---------------------------------------------------------------------------

    \3\ Exclusion of Utility Operations-Related Swaps with Utility 
Special Entities from De Minimis Threshold for Swaps with Special 
Entities, 79 FR 57767 (Sept. 26, 2014).
---------------------------------------------------------------------------

    The information collection burdens associated with these 
regulations (collectively, the ``Swap Recordkeeping Requirements'') are 
restricted to the costs associated with the recordkeeping and reporting 
requirements that these regulations impose upon affected registrants, 
registered entities, those registered entities' members, and other 
respondents covered by the final rules.
    An agency may not conduct or sponsor, and a person is not required 
to respond to, a collection of information unless it displays a 
currently valid OMB control number. On April 14, 2023, the Commission 
published in the Federal Register notice of the proposed

[[Page 41390]]

extension of this information collection and provided 60 days for 
public comment on the proposed extension, 88 FR 23011. The Commission 
received two comments. Commenter Bill Gilbert expressed support for 
transparent reporting of swaps and data in the financial industry, and 
urges the Commission to continue to take steps to ensure data access 
for retail investors.\4\ Commenter Michael Gilbert submitted a similar 
comment also supporting enhanced swap data reporting for the benefit of 
retail investors.\5\ The Commission prioritizes improved access to 
swaps data for retail investors, and considers a renewal of this 
collection to be consistent with that priority.

    Burden Statement: The Commission is revising its estimate of the 
burden for this collection for futures commission merchants, retail 
foreign exchange dealers, introducing brokers, and members of 
designated contract markets and swap execution facilities. The 
respondent burden for this collection is estimated to be as follows: 
\6\
---------------------------------------------------------------------------

    \6\ These estimates represent the aggregate burden for all data 
associated with the Swap Recordkeeping Requirements in the 
collection, namely Swap Recordkeeping (Regulation 1.35), Swap 
Confirmations (Regulation 1.33), and Utility Special Entities 
(Regulation 1.3). Please refer to the supporting statement for 
further explanation of burdens associated with each regulatory 
requirement.
---------------------------------------------------------------------------

    Estimated Number of Respondents: 13,598.\7\
---------------------------------------------------------------------------

    \7\ This number is derived from combining the estimated number 
of FCMs (60), IBs (974), RFEDs (4), DCM members (11,500), and SEF 
members (1,000) as of March 31, 2020. The Commission acknowledges 
that some entities may be double-counted in this estimate. For 
example, an FCM may be a member of a SEF.
---------------------------------------------------------------------------

    Estimated Annual Burden Hours per Respondent: 148.
    Estimated Total Annual Burden Hours: 2,018,728.
    Frequency of Collection: As needed.
    There are no capital costs or operating and maintenance costs 
associated with this collection.
