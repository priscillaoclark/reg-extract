Domestic Sugar Program--FY 2023 Reassignment and FY 2024 Overall 
Sugar Marketing Allotment, Cane Sugar and Beet Sugar Marketing 
Allotments and Company Allocations

AGENCY: Commodity Credit Corporation, USDA.

ACTION: Notice.

-----------------------------------------------------------------------

SUMMARY: The United States Department of Agriculture (USDA) is issuing 
this notice to: revise fiscal year (FY) 2023 (crop year 2022) State 
cane sugar allotments and allocations to sugarcane processors; reassign 
FY 2023 cane sugar marketing allocations to raw cane sugar imports 
already anticipated; and announce the FY 2024 (crop year 2023) overall 
sugar marketing allotment quantity (OAQ), State cane sugar allotments, 
and sugar beet and sugarcane processor allocations. The actions to 
revise and reassign apply to all domestic cane sugar marketed for human 
consumption in the United States from October 1, 2022, through 
September 30, 2023, and the action to announce the allocations applies 
to all domestic beet and cane sugar marketed for human consumption in 
the United States from October 1, 2023, through September 30, 2024.

SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION:

Revisions and Reassignments of FY 2023 Sugar Cane Allotments and 
Allocations

    The Agricultural Adjustment Act of 1938, as amended requires USDA 
to establish the OAQ at a quantity not less than 85 percent of the 
estimated quantity of sugar for domestic human consumption for the crop 
year. On September 30, 2022, USDA announced the initial FY 2023 OAQ, 
which was established at 10,646,250 short tons, raw value (STRV), equal 
to 85 percent of 12,525,000 STRV, the estimated quantity of sugar for 
domestic human consumption for the year as forecast in the September 
2022 World Agricultural Supply and Demand Estimates report (WASDE). The 
notice was issued in the Federal Register on September 30, 2022 (87 FR 
59390-59391). USDA requires that 54.35 percent of the OAQ be 
distributed among beet processors and 45.65 percent be distributed 
among the sugarcane States and cane processors. The beet and cane 
sector allotments were distributed to individual processors according 
to formulas prescribed by the Agricultural Adjustment Act of 1938 (7 
U.S.C. 1359aa-1359jj) and 7 CFR part 1435.
    In the March 2023 WASDE release, USDA increased the FY 2023 
estimate of sugar consumption for food use to 12,600,000 STRV. As a 
result, USDA increased the FY 2023 OAQ to 10,710,000 STRV, increased 
the beet sector allotment to 5,820,885 STRV, raised the cane sector 
allotment to 4,889,115 STRV, and revised beet and cane processor 
allocations accordingly. This notice was issued in the Federal Register 
notice on April 11, 2023 (88 FR 21704-21606).
    In accordance with section 359e of the Agricultural Adjustment Act 
of 1938 (7 U.S.C. 1359ee), after evaluating each sugarcane processor's 
ability to market its full allocation, USDA is transferring FY 2023 
allocations from sugarcane processors with surplus allocation to those 
with deficit allocation as shown in the table below. USDA has also 
determined that domestic cane sugar supplies are inadequate to fill the 
FY 2023 cane sugar marketing allotment.
    In accordance with 7 U.S.C. 1359ee(b)(2), USDA is reassigning 
100,000 STRV of the deficit to raw cane sugar imports already 
anticipated, given the absence of any Commodity Credit Corporation 
(CCC) stocks of sugar. In

Table 1 below, each sugar cane processor's allocation following these 
changes is shown in the column labeled ``Revised Allocations & 
Allotments'' and the amount of change in each cane processor's 
allocation in the column labeled ``Reassignments.''
    USDA is not reassigning any FY 2023 beet allocations to raw cane 
sugar imports at this time given the uncertainty about how much beet 
sugar will be produced from new crop sugar beets in the final 2 months 
(August-September) of FY 2023.

FY 2024 Overall Sugar Marketing Allotment, Cane Sugar and Beet Sugar 
Marketing Allotments, and Company Allocations

    USDA is establishing the initial FY 2024 (crop year 2023) OAQ at 
10,667,500 STRV, equal to 85 percent of 12,550,000 STRV, the estimated 
quantity of sugar for domestic human consumption for FY 2024 as 
forecast in the September 2023 WASDE. As noted above, 54.35 percent of 
the OAQ is distributed among beet processors and 45.65 percent is 
distributed among the sugarcane States and cane processors, with the 
beet and cane sector allotments distributed to individual processors 
according to formulas set out in the Agricultural Adjustment Act of 
1938 and 7 CFR part 1435. Although the Act directs USDA to assign 
325,000 STRV of the cane sector allotment to ``offshore States,'' CCC 
has determined that no offshore States exist. While sugar cane was 
formerly produced in Puerto Rico and Hawaii, CCC has determined that 
both States have permanently exited sugarcane production. As a result, 
CCC has allocated the 325,000 STRV of the cane sector allotment 
previously reserved for offshore States to the mainland sugarcane 
producing States. The initial FY 2024 sugar marketing State allotments 
and processor allocations are listed in Table 2 below.
