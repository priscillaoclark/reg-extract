January 10, 2024.
    Pursuant to Section 19(b)(1) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 
(``Act''),\1\ and Rule 19b-4 thereunder,\2\ notice is hereby given that 
on January 2, 2024, Cboe BZX Exchange, Inc. (the ``Exchange'' or 
``BZX'') filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission 
(``Commission'') the proposed rule change as described in Items I, II, 
and III below, which Items have been prepared by the Exchange. The 
Commission is publishing this notice to solicit comments on the 
proposed rule change from interested persons.

I. Self-Regulatory Organization's Statement of the Terms of Substance 
of the Proposed Rule Change

    Cboe BZX Exchange, Inc. (the ``Exchange'' or ``BZX'') proposes to 
amend its Fee Schedule. The text of the proposed rule change is 
provided in Exhibit 5.
    The text of the proposed rule change is also available on the 
Exchange's website (<a href="http://markets.cboe.com/us/equities/regulation/rule_filings/bzx/">http://markets.cboe.com/us/equities/regulation/rule_filings/bzx/</a>), at the Exchange's Office of the Secretary, and at 
the Commission's Public Reference Room.

II. Self-Regulatory Organization's Statement of the Purpose of, and 
Statutory Basis for, the Proposed Rule Change

    In its filing with the Commission, the Exchange included statements 
concerning the purpose of and basis for the proposed rule change and 
discussed any comments it received on the proposed rule change. The 
text of these statements may be examined at the places specified in 
Item IV below. The Exchange has prepared summaries, set forth in 
sections A, B, and C below, of the most significant aspects of such 
statements.

A. Self-Regulatory Organization's Statement of the Purpose of, and 
Statutory Basis for, the Proposed Rule Change

1. Purpose
    The Exchange proposes to amend its Fee Schedule applicable to its 
equities trading platform (``BZX Equities'') by deleting the Cross 
Asset Tier (and a related definition) from the Fee Schedule. The 
Exchange proposes to implement these changes effective January 2, 2024.
    The Exchange first notes that it operates in a highly competitive 
market in which market participants can readily direct order flow to 
competing venues if they deem fee levels at a particular venue to be 
excessive or incentives to be insufficient. More specifically, the 
Exchange is only one of 16 registered equities exchanges, as well as a 
number of alternative trading systems and other off-exchange venues 
that do not have similar self-regulatory responsibilities under the 
Securities Exchange Act of 1934 (the ``Act''), to which market 
participants may direct their order flow. Based on publicly available 
information,\3\ no single registered equities exchange has more than 
15% of the market share. Thus, in such a low-concentrated and highly 
competitive market, no single equities exchange possesses significant 
pricing power in the execution of order flow. The Exchange in 
particular operates a ``Maker-Taker'' model whereby it pays rebates to 
members that add liquidity and assesses fees to those that remove 
liquidity. The Exchange's Fee Schedule sets forth the standard rebates 
and rates applied per share for orders that provide and remove 
liquidity, respectively. Currently, for orders in securities priced at 
or above $1.00, the Exchange provides a standard rebate of $0.00160 per 
share for orders that add liquidity and assesses a fee of $0.0030 per 
share for orders that remove liquidity.\4\ For orders in securities 
priced below $1.00, the Exchange provides a standard rebate of $0.00009 
[sic] per share for orders that add liquidity and assesses a fee of 
0.30% of the total dollar value for orders that remove liquidity.\5\ 
Additionally, in response to the competitive environment, the Exchange 
also offers tiered pricing which provides Members opportunities to 
qualify for higher rebates or reduced fees where certain volume 
criteria and thresholds are met. Tiered pricing provides an incremental 
incentive for Members to strive for higher tier levels, which provides 
increasingly higher benefits or discounts for satisfying increasingly 
more stringent criteria.

---------------------------------------------------------------------------

Cross Asset Tier
    Under footnote 2 of the Fee Schedule, the Exchange offers various 
Step-Up Tiers that provide enhanced rebates for orders yielding fee 
codes B,\6\ V \7\ and Y \8\ where a Member reaches certain add volume-
based criteria, including ``growing'' its volume over a certain 
baseline month. Additionally, under footnote 2, the Exchange offers a 
Cross Asset Tier which is designed to incentivize Members to achieve 
certain levels of participation on both the Exchange's equities and 
options platform (``BZX Options''). The Exchange now proposes to delete 
the Cross Asset Tier from the Fee Schedule as the tier expired on 
December 31, 2023. Additionally, the Exchange does not wish to, nor is 
required to, maintain such tier by proposing to amend the expiration 
date or the criteria associated with the Cross Asset Tier. More 
specifically, the proposed change lets this tier expire as the Exchange 
would rather redirect future resources and funding into other programs 
and tiers intended to incentivize increased order flow. In conjunction 
with discontinuing the Cross Asset Tier, the Exchange proposes to 
remove the definition of Customer ADAV \9\ from its fee schedule as 
this definition is not used for any other tier.

    \6\ Fee code B is appended to displayed orders that add 
liquidity to BZX in Tape B securities.
    \7\ Fee code V is appended to displayed orders that add 
liquidity to BZX in Tape A securities.
    \8\ Fee code Y is appended to displayed orders that add 
liquidity to BZX in Tape C securities.
    \9\ Customer ADAV means average daily volume calculated as the 
number of contracts added for the account of a Priority Customer as 
defined in BZX Rule 16.1.
---------------------------------------------------------------------------

2. Statutory Basis
    The Exchange believes the proposed rule change is consistent with 
the Act and the rules and regulations thereunder applicable to the 
Exchange and, in particular, the requirements of Section 6(b) of the 
Act.\10\ Specifically, the Exchange believes the proposed rule change 
is consistent with the Section 6(b)(5) \11\ requirements that the rules 
of an exchange be designed to prevent fraudulent and manipulative acts 
and practices, to promote just and equitable principles of trade, to 
foster cooperation and coordination with persons engaged in regulating, 
clearing, settling,

[[Page 3006]]

processing information with respect to, and facilitating transactions 
in securities, to remove impediments to and perfect the mechanism of a 
free and open market and a national market system, and, in general, to 
protect investors and the public interest. Additionally, the Exchange 
believes the proposed rule change is consistent with the Section 
6(b)(5) \12\ requirement that the rules of an exchange not be designed 
to permit unfair discrimination between customers, issuers, brokers, or 
dealers as well as Section 6(b)(4) \13\ as it is designed to provide 
for the equitable allocation of reasonable dues, fees and other charges 
among its Members and other persons using its facilities.

---------------------------------------------------------------------------

    The Exchange believes that its proposal to eliminate the Cross 
Asset Tier and the related definition of Customer ADAV from the Fee 
Schedule is reasonable because the tier has expired. Additionally, the 
Exchange is not required to maintain this tier by amending the criteria 
or extending the expiration date to a date in the future nor is it 
required to provide Members an opportunity to receive enhanced rebates. 
The Exchange believes its proposal to let the tier expire is also 
equitable and not unfairly discriminatory because it applies to all 
Members (i.e., the tier will not be available for any Member). The 
Exchange also notes that the proposed rule change to remove this tier 
merely results in Members not receiving an enhanced rebate, which, as 
noted above, the Exchange is not required to offer or maintain. 
Furthermore, the proposed rule change to let the Cross Asset Tier 
expire enables the Exchange to redirect resources and funding into 
other programs and tiers intended to incentivize increased order flow.

B. Self-Regulatory Organization's Statement on Burden on Competition

    The Exchange does not believe that the proposed rule change will 
impose any burden on competition that is not necessary or appropriate 
in furtherance of the purposes of the Act. Rather, as discussed above, 
the Exchange believes that the proposed change would encourage the 
submission of additional order flow to a public exchange, thereby 
promoting market depth, execution incentives and enhanced execution 
opportunities, as well as price discovery and transparency for all 
Members. As a result, the Exchange believes that the proposed changes 
further the Commission's goal in adopting Regulation NMS of fostering 
competition among orders, which promotes ``more efficient pricing of 
individual stocks for all types of orders, large and small.''
    The Exchange believes the proposed rule changes do not impose any 
burden on intramarket competition that is not necessary or appropriate 
in furtherance of the purposes of the Act. Particularly, the proposed 
change to not renew the Cross Asset Tier and delete it and the related 
definition of Customer ADAV from the Fee Schedule will not impose any 
burden on intramarket competition because the changes apply to all 
Members uniformly, as in, the tier will no longer be available to any 
Member in accordance with its expiration date.
    Next, the Exchange believes the proposed rule changes does not 
impose any burden on intermarket competition that is not necessary or 
appropriate in furtherance of the purposes of the Act. As previously 
discussed, the Exchange operates in a highly competitive market. 
Members have numerous alternative venues that they may participate on 
and direct their order flow, including other equities exchanges, off-
exchange venues, and alternative trading systems. Additionally, the 
Exchange represents a small percentage of the overall market. Based on 
publicly available information, no single equities exchange has more 
than 15% of the market share.\14\ Therefore, no exchange possesses 
significant pricing power in the execution of order flow. Indeed, 
participants can readily choose to send their orders to other exchange 
and off-exchange venues if they deem fee levels at those other venues 
to be more favorable. Moreover, the Commission has repeatedly expressed 
its preference for competition over regulatory intervention in 
determining prices, products, and services in the securities markets. 
Specifically, in Regulation NMS, the Commission highlighted the 
importance of market forces in determining prices and SRO revenues and, 
also, recognized that current regulation of the market system ``has 
been remarkably successful in promoting market competition in its 
broader forms that are most important to investors and listed 
companies.'' \15\ The fact that this market is competitive has also 
long been recognized by the courts. In NetCoalition v. Securities and 
Exchange Commission, the D.C. Circuit stated as follows: ``[n]o one 
disputes that competition for order flow is `fierce.' . . . As the SEC 
explained, `[i]n the U.S. national market system, buyers and sellers of 
securities, and the broker-dealers that act as their order-routing 
agents, have a wide range of choices of where to route orders for 
execution'; [and] `no exchange can afford to take its market share 
percentages for granted' because `no exchange possesses a monopoly, 
regulatory or otherwise, in the execution of order flow from broker 
dealers'. . . .''.\16\ Accordingly, the Exchange does not believe its 
proposed fee change imposes any burden on competition that is not 
necessary or appropriate in furtherance of the purposes of the Act.
