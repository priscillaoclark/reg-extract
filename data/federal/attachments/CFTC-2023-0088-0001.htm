SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION: 
    Title: Rules Relating to the Operations and Activities of Commodity 
Pool Operators and Commodity Trading Advisors and to Monthly Reporting 
by Futures Commission Merchants (OMB Control No. 3038-0005). This is a 
request for extension of a currently approved information collection.
    Abstract: The various collections of information required by part 4 
of the Commission's regulations were previously approved by OMB in 
accordance with the PRA and assigned OMB control number 3038-0005.\2\ 
The Commission offers the following summary of the renewal and the 
resulting impact on existing burden hour estimates associated with this 
information collection. The Commodity Exchange Act (CEA) empowers the 
Commission with the authority to require commodity pool operators 
(CPOs) and commodity trading advisors (CTAs) to maintain books and 
records and to file reports as required by the Commission.\3\ The 
Commission also has the power to promulgate such regulations as it 
deems necessary to implement the purposes of the CEA.\4\ It is pursuant 
to this authority that the Commission has promulgated the various 
compliance requirements for CPOs and CTAs in 17 CFR part 4. The 
reporting, filing, and recordkeeping requirements within part 4 of the 
Commission's regulations were adopted to assist and inform customers, 
to establish customer protection initiatives for investors, to 
facilitate monitoring intermediary compliance with part 4 regulations 
by the Commission and its delegee, the National Futures Association 
(NFA), and to enable the Commission to better monitor the market risks 
posed by its registrants. The information collections are necessary to 
enable the Commission and NFA to accomplish the purposes of both the 
CEA and the compliance regime set forth in part 4 of the Commission's 
regulations.

---------------------------------------------------------------------------

    An agency may not conduct or sponsor, and a person is not required 
to respond to, a collection of information unless it displays a 
currently valid OMB control number. On July 12, 2023, the Commission 
published in the Federal Register notice of the proposed extension of 
this information collection and provided 60 days for public comment on 
the proposed extension, 88 FR 44280 (60-Day Notice). The Commission did 
not receive any relevant substantive comments on the 60-Day Notice.
    Burden Statement: The respondent burden for this collection is 
estimated to be as follows:
    Respondents/Affected Entities: (1) All persons filing reports 
required by 17 CFR part 4, and (2) all principals of such persons.
    Estimated number of respondents: 49,083.
    Estimated number of exempt pools/reports per respondent: 8.8.
    Estimated total annual burden on respondents: 432,325 hours.

(Authority: 44 U.S.C. 3501, et seq.)

    Dated: September 19, 2023.
Robert Sidman,
Deputy Secretary of the Commission.
