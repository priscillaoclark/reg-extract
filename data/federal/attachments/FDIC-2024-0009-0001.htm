    General Description of Collection: Section 29 of the Federal 
Deposit Insurance Act prohibits undercapitalized insured depository 
institutions from accepting, renewing, or rolling over any brokered 
deposits. Adequately capitalized institutions may do so with a waiver 
from the FDIC, while well-capitalized institutions may accept, renew, 
or roll over brokered deposits without restriction. This information 
collection captures the burden associated with preparing and filing an 
application for a waiver of the prohibition on the acceptance of 
brokered deposits. There is no change in the methodology or substance 
of this information collection. The reduction in burden is primarily 
due to the fact that virtually all FDIC-supervised institutions have 
gone through the implementation burden and face primarily burden 
related to their ongoing operations.

Request for Comment

    Comments are invited on: (a) Whether the collections of information 
are necessary for the proper performance of the FDIC's functions, 
including whether the information has practical utility; (b) the 
accuracy of the estimates of the burden of the information collections, 
including the validity of the methodology and assumptions used; (c) 
ways to enhance the quality, utility, and clarity of the information to 
be collected; and (d) ways to minimize the burden of the collections of 
information on respondents, including through the use of automated 
collection techniques or other forms of information technology. All 
comments will become a matter of public record.

Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation.

    Dated at Washington, DC, February 2, 2024.

Assistant Executive Secretary.
