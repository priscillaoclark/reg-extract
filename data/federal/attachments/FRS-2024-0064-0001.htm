OMB control numbers to collections of information conducted or 
sponsored by the Board. In exercising this delegated authority, the 
Board is directed to take every reasonable step to solicit comment. In 
determining whether to approve a collection of information, the Board 
will consider all comments received from the public and other agencies.
    During the comment period for this proposal, a copy of the proposed 
PRA OMB submission, including the draft reporting form and 
instructions, supporting statement (which contains more detail about 
the information collection and burden estimates than this notice), and 
other documentation, will be made available on the Board's public 
website at <a href="https://www.federalreserve.gov/apps/reportingforms/home/review">https://www.federalreserve.gov/apps/reportingforms/home/review</a> or may be requested from the agency clearance officer, whose 
name appears above. Final versions of these documents will be made 
available at <a href="https://www.reginfo.gov/public/do/PRAMain">https://www.reginfo.gov/public/do/PRAMain</a>, if approved.

Request for Comment on Information Collection Proposal

    The Board invites public comment on the following information 
collection, which is being reviewed under authority delegated by the 
OMB under the PRA. Comments are invited on the following:
    a. Whether the proposed collection of information is necessary for 
the proper performance of the Board's functions, including whether the 
information has practical utility;
    b. The accuracy of the Board's estimate of the burden of the 
proposed information collection, including the validity of the 
methodology and assumptions used;
    c. Ways to enhance the quality, utility, and clarity of the 
information to be collected;
    d. Ways to minimize the burden of information collection on 
respondents, including through the use of automated collection 
techniques or other forms of information technology; and
    e. Estimates of capital or startup costs and costs of operation, 
maintenance, and purchase of services to provide information.
    At the end of the comment period, the comments and recommendations 
received will be analyzed to determine the extent to which the Board 
should modify the proposal.

Proposal Under OMB Delegated Authority To Extend for Three Years, 
Without Revision, the Following Information Collection

    Collection title: Recordkeeping and Disclosure Requirements 
Associated with the CFPB's Regulation M.
    Collection identifier: FR M.
    OMB control number: 7100-0202.
    General description of collection: The Consumer Leasing Act (CLA) 
and Regulation M require lessors uniformly to disclose to consumers the 
costs, liabilities, and terms of consumer lease transactions. The Dodd-
Frank Wall Street Reform and Consumer Protection Act transferred 
rulemaking authority for the CLA to the CFPB except for certain motor 
vehicle dealers that are excluded from the CFPB's authority, which 
remain subject to the Board's Regulation M. The FR M is the Board's 
information collection associated with Regulation M. These disclosures 
are provided to consumers before they enter lease transactions and in 
advertisements that state the availability of consumer leases on 
particular terms. The disclosures are intended to provide consumers 
with meaningful disclosures about the costs and terms of leases for 
personal property and enable consumers to compare the terms for a 
particular lease with those for other leases and, when appropriate, to 
compare lease terms with those for credit transactions.
    Frequency: Event generated.
    Respondents: The FR M panel comprises state member banks with 
assets of $10 billion or less that are not affiliated with an insured 
depository institution with assets over $10 billion (irrespective of 
the consolidated assets of any holding company); non-depository 
affiliates of such state member banks; and non-depository affiliates of 
bank holding companies that are not affiliated with an insured 
depository institution with assets over $10 billion. Notwithstanding 
the foregoing, the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau, and not the 
Board, has supervisory authority for Regulation M with respect to 
automobile leasing over non-banks defined as ``larger participants'' in 
the automobile finance market pursuant to 12 U.S.C. 5514 (implemented 
by 12 CFR 1090.108).
    Total estimated number of respondents: 3.
    Total estimated annual burden hours: 17.\1\

including more detailed burden estimates, can be found in the OMB 
Supporting Statement posted at <a href="https://www.federalreserve.gov/apps/reportingforms/home/review">https://www.federalreserve.gov/apps/reportingforms/home/review</a>. On the page displayed at the link, you
