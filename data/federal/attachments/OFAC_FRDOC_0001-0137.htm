    Background. On December 3, 1999, the Kingpin Act was signed into 
law by the President of the United States. The Kingpin Act provides a 
statutory framework for the President to impose sanctions against 
significant foreign narcotics traffickers and their organizations on a 
worldwide basis, with the objective of denying their businesses and 
agents access to the U.S. financial system and to the benefits of trade 
and transactions involving U.S. persons and entities.
    The Kingpin Act blocks all property and interests in property, 
subject to U.S. jurisdiction, that is owned or controlled by 
significant foreign narcotics traffickers, as identified by the 
President. In addition, the Secretary of the Treasury consults with the 
Attorney General, the Director of the Central Intelligence Agency, the 
Director of the Federal Bureau of Investigation, the Administrator of 
the Drug Enforcement Administration, the Secretary of Defense, the 
Secretary of State, and the Secretary of Homeland Security when 
designating and blocking the property or interests in property, subject 
to U.S. jurisdiction, of persons or entities found to be: (1) 
Materially assisting in, or providing financial or technological 
support for or to, or providing goods or services in support of, the 
international narcotics trafficking activities of a person designated 
pursuant to the Kingpin Act; (2) owned, controlled, or directed by, or 
acting for or on behalf of, a person designated pursuant to the Kingpin 
Act; and/or (3) playing a significant role in international narcotics 
trafficking.
    On June 10, 2010, OFAC removed from the SDN list the two 
individuals listed below, whose property and interests in property were 
blocked pursuant to the Kingpin Act.
