regulations to implement a provision of the Federal Housing Enterprises 
Financial Safety and Soundness Act of 1992, as amended. The final rule 
had an effective date of February 27, 2023. FHFA has determined that a 
delay of the effective date of the final rule by 60 days is 
appropriate.

published December 27, 2022, at 87 FR 79217, is delayed until April 28, 
2023.

SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION: On December 27, 2022, FHFA published in the 
Federal Register the final rule which, in accordance with 12 U.S.C. 
4541, establishes a process for the Federal National Mortgage 
Association (Fannie Mae) and the Federal Home Loan Mortgage Corporation 
(Freddie Mac) (collectively, the Enterprises) to provide advance notice 
to the FHFA Director before offering a new activity to the market and 
to obtain prior approval from the Director before offering a new 
product to the market. Among other elements of the process, the final 
rule establishes criteria for FHFA and the Enterprises to identify new 
activities, requires an Enterprise to submit a notice of new activity 
to FHFA that contains certain specified information along with a 
certification from an executive officer before commencing a new 
activity, and requires FHFA to review the notice of new activity within 
a strict timeframe.
    The final rule was published with an effective date of February 27, 
2023. In view of the progress made towards implementation, FHFA has 
determined that it is appropriate to delay the effective date by 60 
days to April 28, 2023. This will allow FHFA and the Enterprises 
sufficient time to develop the internal infrastructure and processes 
necessary to comply with the requirements set forth in the final rule. 
In the interim, FHFA will require the Enterprises to delay commencement 
of any activities that satisfy the new activity criteria until those 
activities can be reviewed by FHFA in accordance with the final rule.

Sandra L. Thompson,
Director, Federal Housing Finance Agency.
