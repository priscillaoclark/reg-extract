SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION:

Background

    The Convention on Cultural Property Implementation Act (Pub. L. 97-
446, 19 U.S.C. 2601 et seq.) (CPIA), which implements the 1970 United 
Nations Educational, Scientific and Cultural Organization (UNESCO) 
Convention on the Means of Prohibiting and Preventing the Illicit 
Import, Export and Transfer of Ownership of Cultural Property (823 
U.N.T.S. 231 (1972)) (Convention), allows for the conclusion of an 
agreement between the United States and another party to the Convention 
to impose import restrictions on eligible

[[Page 73275]]

archaeological and ethnological material. In certain limited 
circumstances, the CPIA authorizes the imposition of restrictions on an 
emergency basis (19 U.S.C. 2603). The emergency restrictions are 
effective for no more than five years from the date of the State 
Party's request and may be extended for three years where it is 
determined that the emergency condition continues to apply with respect 
to the covered material (19 U.S.C. 2603(c)(3)). These restrictions may 
also be continued, in whole or in part, pursuant to an agreement 
concluded within the meaning of the CPIA (19 U.S.C. 2603(c)(4)).
    On February 7, 2020, U.S. Customs and Border Protection (CBP) 
published a final rule, CBP Decision (CBP Dec.) 20-01, in the Federal 
Register (85 FR 7209), which amended Sec.  12.104g(b) of title 19 of 
the Code of Federal Regulations (19 CFR 12.104g(b)) to reflect the 
imposition of import restrictions on certain archaeological material 
and ethnological material of Yemen under the emergency protection 
provisions of the CPIA.
    Following imposition of the emergency import restrictions, the 
United States entered into a bilateral agreement with the Republic of 
Yemen \1\ under the CPIA to continue the emergency import restrictions 
on certain archaeological and ethnological material of Yemen through 
April 15, 2029, with modifications to the Designated List. This period 
may be extended for additional periods, each extension not to exceed 5 
years, if it is determined that the factors justifying the initial 
agreement still pertain and no cause for suspension of the agreement 
exists (19 U.S.C. 2602(e); Sec.  12.104g(a) of title 19 of the Code of 
Federal Regulations (19 CFR 12.104g(a))).
---------------------------------------------------------------------------

    \1\ Due to an ongoing conflict within Yemen, this rule shall use 
the ``Republic of Yemen'' to denote the State party to the agreement 
and ``Yemen'' when discussing the archaeological/ethnological 
material and cultural heritage subject to the import restrictions.
---------------------------------------------------------------------------

Determinations

    Under 19 U.S.C. 2602(a)(1), the United States must make certain 
determinations before entering into an agreement to impose import 
restrictions under 19 U.S.C. 2602(a)(2). On November 18, 2022, the 
Assistant Secretary for Educational and Cultural Affairs, United States 
Department of State, after consultation with and recommendation by the 
Cultural Property Advisory Committee, made the determinations required 
under the statute with respect to certain archaeological and 
ethnological material originating in Yemen that is described in the 
Designated List set forth below in this document.
    These determinations include the following: (1) that the cultural 
patrimony of Yemen is in jeopardy from the pillage of archaeological 
material, dating from approximately 200,000 B.C. to A.D. 1773, and 
ethnological material representing Yemen's cultural heritage, ranging 
in date from approximately A.D. 1517 through 1918 (19 U.S.C. 
2602(a)(1)(A)); (2) that the Republic of Yemen Government has taken 
measures consistent with the Convention to protect its cultural 
patrimony (19 U.S.C. 2602(a)(1)(B)); (3) that import restrictions 
imposed by the United States would be of substantial benefit in 
deterring a serious situation of pillage and remedies less drastic are 
not available (19 U.S.C. 2602(a)(1)(C)); and (4) that the application 
of import restrictions as set forth in this final rule is consistent 
with the general interests of the international community in the 
interchange of cultural property among nations for scientific, 
cultural, and educational purposes (19 U.S.C. 2602(a)(1)(D)). The 
Assistant Secretary also found that the material included in the 
determinations meets the statutory definition of ``archaeological or 
ethnological material of the State Party'' (19 U.S.C. 2601(2)).

The Agreement

    On August 30, 2023, the Governments of the United States and the 
Republic of Yemen signed a bilateral agreement, ``Memorandum of 
Understanding Between the Government of the United States of America 
and the Government of the Republic of Yemen Concerning the Imposition 
of Import Restrictions on Categories of Archaeological and Ethnological 
Material of Yemen,'' (the Agreement) pursuant to the provisions of 19 
U.S.C. 2602(a)(2). The Agreement entered into force on April 15, 2024, 
following the exchange of diplomatic notes, and modifies the previously 
imposed emergency import restrictions on archaeological material dated 
from approximately 200,000 B.C. to A.D. 1773, as well as certain 
ethnological material of Yemeni cultural heritage from A.D. 1517 
through 1918. A list of the categories of archaeological and 
ethnological material subject to the import restrictions is set forth 
later in this document.

Restrictions and Amendment to the Regulations

    Import restrictions on the archaeological and ethnological material 
of Yemen previously reflected in Sec.  12.104g(b) will be continued 
through the Agreement without interruption. Accordingly, Sec.  
12.104g(a) of the CBP regulations is being amended to indicate that 
restrictions have been imposed pursuant to the Agreement, and the 
emergency import restrictions on certain categories of archaeological 
and ethnological material of Yemen are being removed from Sec.  
12.104g(b), as those restrictions are now encompassed in Sec.  
12.104g(a). Pursuant to the Agreement, and consistent with the CPIA, 
the Designated List originally published with the emergency 
restrictions in CBP Dec. 20-01 is being amended to correct certain 
typographical errors, to extend the date range for archaeological 
material to A.D. 1773, to clarify certain categories of archaeological 
material, to add the subcategory ``Inscribed Documents'' to the list of 
archaeological materials, to clarify that the ethnological material 
listed excludes Jewish ceremonial and ritual objects and manuscripts, 
and to reorganize the list of ethnological material by type of object 
instead of by material.

Designated List of Archaeological and Ethnological Material of Yemen

    The Agreement between the United States and the Republic of Yemen 
includes, but is not limited to, the categories of objects described in 
the Designated List set forth below.
    The Designated List includes archaeological and ethnological 
material from Yemen. The archaeological material in the Designated List 
includes, but is not limited to, objects made of stone, metal, ceramic, 
clay, glass, faience, semi-precious stone, paintings, plaster, 
textiles, leather, parchment, paper, wood, bone, ivory, shell, human 
remains, and/or other organic materials dated from approximately 
200,000 B.C. to A.D. 1773. The ethnological material in the Designated 
List includes, but is not limited to, architectural materials, 
manuscripts, and religious and ceremonial objects from approximately 
A.D. 1517 to 1918. This would exclude Jewish ceremonial or ritual 
objects and manuscripts. The Designated List is representative only. 
Any dates and dimensions are approximate. For the reader's convenience, 
CBP is reproducing the Designated List contained in CBP Dec. 20-01 in 
its entirety with the previously detailed modifications.

    9. Coins--A reference book for ancient, pre-Islamic material in 
Yemen is M. Huth, Coinage of the Caravan Kingdoms: Ancient Arabian 
Coins from the Collection of Martin Huth, New York, 2010, pp. 68-152. A 
reference book for Islamic coinage to A.D. 1773 is S. Album, Checklist 
of Islamic Coins, Santa Rosa, 2011, pp. 116-127. Some of the best-known 
types are described below:
    a. South Arabian Period--In gold, silver, and bronze/copper, with 
units ranging from tetradrachms down to various fractional levels.
    i. Earliest coins from Yemen are imitations of silver tetradrachms 
from Athens, featuring a bust of Athena on the obverse and an owl on 
the reverse. The style of these imitations is distinctive, and they are 
usually marked with South Arabian monograms or graffiti. Approximate 
dates: 500 B.C. and later.
    ii. Mineans produced schematic imitations of the Athenian coinage; 
these coins have angular shapes, often triangular. Style is distinctive 
with monograms with South Arabian letters. Approximate date: 200 B.C.
    iii. Sabaeans struck distinctive local imitations of Athenian 
tetradrachms, with or without monograms, often with the curved symbol 
of Almaqah to the right of the owl, and of smaller units than 
previously. In the 1st century A.D., the head of Athena is replaced 
with a male bust resembling Augustus; owl on the reverse continues, as 
do monograms and the curved symbol. In the 2nd and 3rd centuries A.D., 
a beardless male head appears on the coins with the curved symbol, and 
a facing bucranium (a bull's head) appears on the reverse with the 
curved symbol and monograms. Approximate dates: 400 B.C. to A.D. 300.
    iv. Himyarite coins feature beardless male heads on the obverse 
coupled with bearded male heads on the reverse. Various South Arabian 
monograms appear on the coins. Rulers include, but are not limited to, 
Yuhabirr, Karib'il Yehun[revaps]im Wattar, Amdan Yuhaqbid, Amdan Bayan, 
Tha'ran Ya[revaps]ub, Shamnar Yuhan[revaps]am, and unknown kings. 
Approximate dates: 110 B.C. to A.D. 200.
    v. Qatabanians also produced imitations of Athenian coins in the 
2nd to 4th century B.C., with or without monograms; distinctive style. 
From the 2nd century B.C. to the 2nd century A.D., the head of Athena 
is replaced with male ruler portraits, including, but not limited to, 
those of Yad'ab Dhubyan Yuhargib, Dhub, Hawfi[revaps]amm 
Yuhan[revaps]am III, Shahr Yagul, Waraw'il Ghaylan, Shahr Hilal, 
Yad[revaps]ab Yanaf, and various unknown rulers. Reverses of early 
types have the owl, while later types have a second portrait on the 
reverse. Approximate dates: 400 B.C. to A.D. 200.
    vi. Bronze coins from Hadhramaut have radiate male portraits in a 
circle on the obverse and a standing bull on the reverse; South Arabian 
symbols appear. Approximate dates: A.D. 200 to 400.
    vii. Various South Arabian types imitate Athenian coins, 
Hellenistic Alexander tetradrachms with a head of Herakles on the 
obverse and Zeus seated on the reverse, and Ptolemaic coins with a 
cornucopia on the reverse. Style is distinctive; designs are 
accompanied by South Arabian monograms.
    b. Islamic Period--In gold, silver, and bronze. Including anonymous 
mints in Yemen and coins of unknown rulers attributed to Yemen. Non-
exclusive mints are the primary manufacturers of the listed coins, but

mint. Approximate dates: A.D. 1000 to 1100.
    v. Coins of the Amirs of `Aththar, struck in gold, at the mint of 
`Aththar. Approximate dates: A.D. 957 to 988.
    vi. Tarafid coins, struck in silver, at the mint of `Aththar.

Inapplicability of Notice and Delayed Effective Date

    This amendment involves a foreign affairs function of the United 
States and is, therefore, being made without notice or public procedure 
under 5 U.S.C. 553(a)(1). For the same reason, a delayed effective date 
is not required under 5 U.S.C. 553(d)(3).

Executive Orders 12866 and 13563

    Executive Orders 12866 (Regulatory Planning and Review), as amended 
by Executive Order 14094 (Modernizing Regulatory Review), and 13563 
(Improving Regulation and Regulatory Review) direct agencies to assess 
the costs and benefits of available regulatory alternatives and, if 
regulation is necessary, to select regulatory approaches that maximize 
net benefits (including potential economic, environmental, public 
health and safety effects, distributive impacts, and equity). Executive 
Order 13563 emphasizes the importance of quantifying costs and 
benefits, reducing costs, harmonizing rules, and promoting flexibility. 
CBP has determined that this document is not a regulation or rule 
subject to the provisions of Executive Orders 12866 and 13563 because 
it pertains to a foreign affairs function of the United States, as 
described above, and therefore is specifically exempted by section 
3(d)(2) of Executive Order 12866 and, by extension, Executive Order 
13563.

Regulatory Flexibility Act

    The Regulatory Flexibility Act (5 U.S.C. 601 et seq.), as amended 
by the Small Business Regulatory Enforcement Fairness Act of 1996, 
requires an agency to prepare and make available to the public a 
regulatory flexibility analysis that describes the effect of a proposed 
rule on small entities (i.e., small businesses, small organizations, 
and small governmental jurisdictions) when the agency is required to 
publish a general notice of proposed rulemaking for a rule. Since a 
general notice of proposed rulemaking is not necessary for this rule, 
CBP is not required to prepare a regulatory flexibility analysis for 
this rule.
