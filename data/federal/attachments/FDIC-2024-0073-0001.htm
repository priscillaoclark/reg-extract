SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION: Pursuant to the Privacy Act of 1974, 5 
U.S.C. 552a, as amended, the FDIC is establishing a new system of 
records titled FDIC-042, Insider Risk Program Records, to support the 
operation of the FDIC Insider Risk (InR) Program. The FDIC InR Program 
seeks to deter, detect, prevent and mitigate risk to FDIC personnel, 
facilities, assets, resources and information by insiders. This risk 
can include damage to the FDIC through espionage, terrorism, 
unauthorized disclosure of information, or through the loss or 
degradation of FDIC information, resources, and capabilities. The risk 
also includes the effects of workplace-related violence on FDIC 
personnel.
    The FDIC InR Program will use records maintained in this system of 
records to deter, detect, prevent, and mitigate risks or threats from 
insiders, including the analysis, monitoring, and auditing of 
information of such records. The InR Program was established to provide 
an integrated framework for personnel to affirmatively protect the FDIC 
with a defensive program to address risks posed to its personnel, 
facilities, assets, resources, and information by insiders as mandated 
by Executive Order (E.O.) 13587, Structural Reforms to Improve the 
Security of Classified Networks and the Responsible Sharing and 
Safeguarding of Classified Information, issued on October 7, 2011. E.O. 
13587 requires Federal agencies to establish an insider threat 
detection and prevention program and ensure the security of networks 
and the responsible sharing and safeguarding of information consistent 
with the appropriate protections for privacy and civil liberties.
    This newly established system will be included in the FDIC's 
inventory of record systems. The FDIC is also proposing to exempt this 
system of records from certain requirements of the Privacy Act to 
protect against harm to law enforcement and national security 
interests.

SYSTEM NAME AND NUMBER:
    Insider Risk Program Records, FDIC-042.

SECURITY CLASSIFICATION:
    Unclassified and classified.

SYSTEM LOCATION:
    The Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation (FDIC) located at 550 
17th Street NW, Washington, DC 20429, and other FDIC office locations. 
Information may be stored within an appropriately authorized cloud 
environment or in other secure locations.

SYSTEM MANAGER(S):
    Program Manager, Insider Risk (InR) Program, Division of 
Administration, FDIC, 550 17th Street NW, Washington, DC 20429.

AUTHORITY FOR MAINTENANCE OF THE SYSTEM:
    Executive Order (E.O.) 13587, Structural Reforms to Improve the 
Security of Classified Networks and the Responsible Sharing and 
Safeguarding of Classified Information, dated October 7, 2011, and 
National Insider Threat Policy and the Minimum Standards, dated 
November 21, 2012.

PURPOSE(S) OF THE SYSTEM:
    The purpose of this system is to support the operation of the FDIC 
InR Program in deterring, detecting, and mitigating risk to FDIC 
personnel, facilities, assets, resources and information by insiders. 
By identifying and managing insider risks, the InR Program and this 
system of records help the FDIC execute its mission to insure deposits; 
examine and supervise financial institutions for safety, soundness, and 
consumer protection; make large and complex financial institutions 
resolvable; and manage receiverships.
    The FDIC will use the system of records to manage InR matters; 
identify and track potential and verified risks to FDIC; manage 
referrals of potential risks to and from internal and external 
partners; provide authorized assistance to lawful administrative, 
civil, and criminal investigations; generate statistical reports; and 
meet InR reporting requirements. Information in the system of records 
may also be used to support the development and operation of current 
and future information technology to support the objectives of the InR 
Program.

CATEGORIES OF INDIVIDUALS COVERED BY THE SYSTEM:
    The subjects of InR reporting and individuals who exhibit or 
demonstrate insider risk or threat behaviors or activities, which may 
include FDIC

[[Page 70635]]

employees, contractors, detailees, assignees, interns, and authorized 
FDIC visitors or guests.
    In addition, information about other individuals who are not 
covered by this system of records may be collected, such as individuals 
who report concerns about insider risk or threat behaviors or 
activities, witnesses, and relatives.

CATEGORIES OF RECORDS IN THE SYSTEM:
    The particular information collected for any InR matter may vary 
widely depending on the facts and nature of the potential risk or 
threat being assessed and/or mitigated. The system of records may 
maintain information about covered individuals that is relevant to the 
assessment and mitigation of the InR matter, including but not limited 
to the following:
    Biographic, descriptive, and contact information, such as name, 
aliases, physical description/photograph, physical addresses, email 
addresses and phone numbers (personal and work), date and place of

registration information.

and location, office location, telework location, current and past

FDIC contract information, work and education history, FDIC or other 
Government access card/credential information, facility and data access 
privileges, personnel history (e.g., disciplinary or performance 
records), reports of investigations or inquiries regarding security 
violations or misconduct.
    Security-related information, such as data and forms gathered and 
compiled for personnel security, security incidents, visitor security

products pertaining to adversarial risks or threats; other information 
related to an individual's eligibility for access to classified 
information; non-disclosure agreements; document control registries; 
courier authorization requests; records reflecting personal and 
official foreign travel; facility access records; visitor access 
records; records of contacts with foreign persons; and briefing/
debriefing statements for special programs, sensitive positions, and 
other related information and documents required in connection with 
personnel security clearance determinations.
    Activity information, such as logs of an individual's access to and 
use of FDIC information systems and facilities, or those of other 
facilities and systems (e.g., other agency classified or unclassified 
facilities and systems to which the individual has access) if pertinent 
to the insider risk being assessed and/or mitigated.
    Other information, such as medical information relevant to the 
insider risk (e.g., an individual's hospitalization status); images, 
recordings, transcripts, or other media (e.g., CCTV footage, 
voicemails, news reports, social media postings) relevant to the 
insider risk being assessed or mitigated; police reports and other law 
enforcement records; publicly available information; information on 
family members, dependents, relatives and other personal associations, 
to the extent relevant to the particular harm or risk at issue; and 
other information provided to the InR Program by law enforcement, 
employers, witnesses, other Government agencies, or FDIC employees and 
contractors.

RECORD SOURCE CATEGORIES:
    Information in the system is received from individuals, to include 
FDIC personnel and contractors; FDIC recordkeeping systems, information 
assurance databases, and other files; other U.S. Government agencies, 
to include User Activity Monitoring (UAM) repositories; law enforcement 
agencies; the Office of the Inspector General; and publicly available
