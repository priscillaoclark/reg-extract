A. Self-Regulatory Organization's Statement of the Purpose of, and 
Statutory Basis for, the Proposed Rule Change

1. Purpose
    The Exchange proposes to amend the Fee Schedule to extend the 
waiver period for certain non-transaction fees applicable to Market 
Makers that trade solely in Proprietary Products until June 30, 2024.
Background
    On October 12, 2018, the Exchange received approval from the 
Commission to list and trade on the Exchange options on the 
SPIKES[supreg] Index, a new index that measures expected 30-day 
volatility of the SPDR S&P 500 ETF Trust (commonly known and referred 
to by its ticker symbol, ``SPY'').\5\ The Exchange adopted its initial 
SPIKES options transaction fees on February 15, 2019 and adopted a new 
section of the Fee Schedule--Section 1)a)xi), SPIKES--for those 
fees.\6\ Options on the SPIKES Index began trading on the Exchange on 
February 19, 2019.
---------------------------------------------------------------------------

    \5\ See Securities Exchange Act Release No. 84417 (October 12, 
2018), 83 FR 52865 (October 18, 2018) (SR-MIAX-2018-14) (Order 
Granting Approval of a Proposed Rule Change by Miami International 
Securities Exchange, LLC to List and Trade on the Exchange Options 
on the SPIKES[supreg] Index).
    \6\ See Securities Exchange Release No. 85283 (March 11, 2019), 
84 FR 9567 (March 15, 2019) (SR-MIAX-2019-11). The Exchange 
initially filed the proposal on February 15, 2019 (SR-MIAX-2019-04). 
That filing was withdrawn and replaced with SR-MIAX-2019-11. On 
September 30, 2020, the Exchange filed its proposal to, among other 
things, reorganize the Fee Schedule to adopt new Section 1)b), 
Proprietary Products Exchange Fees, and moved the fees and rebates 
for SPIKES options into new Section 1)b)i). See Securities Exchange 
Act Release Nos. 90146 (October 9, 2020), 85 FR 65443 (October 15, 
2020) (SR-MIAX-2020-32); 90814 (December 29, 2020), 86 FR 327 
(January 5, 2021) (SR-MIAX-2020-39).
---------------------------------------------------------------------------

    On May 31, 2019, the Exchange filed its first proposal in a series 
of proposals with the Commission to amend the Fee Schedule to waive 
certain non-transaction fees applicable to Market Makers that trade 
solely in Proprietary Products (including options on the SPIKES Index) 
beginning June 1, 2019, through December 31, 2023.\7\ In particular, 
the Exchange adopted fee waivers for Membership Application fees, 
monthly Market Maker Trading Permit fees, Application Programming 
Interface (``API'') Testing and Certification fees for Members,\8\ and 
monthly MIAX Express Interface (``MEI'') Port \9\ fees assessed to 
Market Makers that trade solely in Proprietary Products (including 
options on SPIKES) throughout the entire period of June 1, 2019 through 
December 31, 2023. The Exchange now proposes to extend the waiver 
period for the same non-

[[Page 84862]]

transaction fees applicable to Market Makers that trade solely in 
Proprietary Products (including options on SPIKES) until June 30, 2024. 
In particular, the Exchange proposes to waive Membership Application 
fees, monthly Market Maker Trading Permit fees, Member API Testing and 
Certification fees, and monthly MEI Port fees assessed to Market Makers 
that trade solely in Proprietary Products (including options on SPIKES) 
until June 30, 2024.

    \7\ See Securities Exchange Act Release Nos. 86109 (June 14,

12, 2023), 88 FR 45936 (July 18, 2023) (SR-MIAX-2023-28).
    \8\ The term ``Member'' means an individual or organization 
approved to exercise the trading rights associated with a Trading 
Permit. Members are deemed ``members'' under the Exchange Act. See 
Exchange Rule 100.
    \9\ Full Service MEI Ports provide Market Makers with the 
ability to send Market Maker simple and complex quotes, eQuotes, and 
quote purge messages to the MIAX System. Full Service MEI Ports are 
also capable of receiving administrative information. Market Makers 
are limited to two Full Service MEI Ports per matching engine. See 
Fee Schedule, infra note 15.
---------------------------------------------------------------------------

Membership Application Fees
    The Exchange currently assesses a one-time Membership Application 
fee for applications of potential Members. The Exchange assesses a one-
time Membership Application fee on the earlier of (i) the date the 
applicant is certified in the membership system, or (ii) once an 
application for MIAX membership is finally denied. The one-time 
application fee is based upon the applicant's status as either a Market 
Maker or an Electronic Exchange Member (``EEM'').\10\ A Market Maker is 
assessed a one-time Membership Application fee of $3,000.
---------------------------------------------------------------------------

    \10\ The term ``Electronic Exchange Member'' or ``EEM'' means 
the holder of a Trading Permit who is not a Market Maker. Electronic 
Exchange Members are deemed ``members'' under the Exchange Act. See 
Exchange Rule 100.
---------------------------------------------------------------------------

    The Exchange proposes that the waiver for the one-time Membership 
Application fee of $3,000 for Market Makers that trade solely in 
Proprietary Products (including options on SPIKES) will be extended 
from December 31, 2023 until June 30, 2024, which the Exchange proposes 
to state in the Fee Schedule. The purpose of this proposed change is to 
continue to provide an incentive for potential Market Makers to submit 
membership applications, which should result in an increase of 
potential liquidity in Proprietary Products, including options on 
SPIKES. Even though the Exchange proposes to extend the waiver of this 
particular fee, the overall structure of the fee is outlined in the Fee 
Schedule so that there is general awareness that the Exchange intends 
to assess such a fee after June 30, 2024.
Trading Permit Fees
    The Exchange issues Trading Permits that confer the ability to 
transact on the Exchange. MIAX Trading Permits are issued to Market 
Makers and EEMs. Members receiving Trading Permits during a particular 
calendar month are assessed monthly Trading Permit fees as set forth in 
the Fee Schedule. As it relates to Market Makers, MIAX currently 
assesses a monthly Trading Permit fee in any month the Market Maker is 
certified in the membership system, is credentialed to use one or more 
MIAX MEI Ports in the production environment and is assigned to quote 
in one or more classes. MIAX assesses the monthly Market Maker Trading 
Permit fee for its Market Makers based on the greatest number of 
classes listed on MIAX that the MIAX Market Maker was assigned to quote 
in on any given day within a calendar month and the applicable fee rate 
is the lesser of either the per class basis or percentage of total 
national average daily volume measurements. A MIAX Market Maker is 
assessed a monthly Trading Permit fee according to the following table:

                                                                                    MIAX.
----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
[Omega] Excludes Proprietary Products.
* For these Monthly MIAX Trading Permit Fee levels, if the Market Maker's total monthly executed volume during
  the relevant month is less than 0.060% of the total monthly executed volume reported by OCC in the market
  maker account type for MIAX-listed option classes for that month, then the fee will be $15,500 instead of the
  fee otherwise applicable to such level.

    MIAX proposes that the waiver for the monthly Trading Permit fee 
for Market Makers that trade solely in Proprietary Products (including 
options on SPIKES) will be extended from December 31, 2023 to June 30, 
2024, which the Exchange proposes to state in the Fee Schedule. The 
purpose of this proposed change is to continue to provide an incentive 
for Market Makers to provide liquidity in Proprietary Products on the 
Exchange, which should result in increasing potential order flow and 
volume in Proprietary Products, including options on SPIKES. Even 
though the Exchange proposes to extend the waiver of this particular 
fee, the overall structure of the fee is outlined in the Fee Schedule 
so that there is general awareness to potential Members seeking a 
Trading Permit that the Exchange intends to assess such a fee after 
June 30, 2024.
    The Exchange also proposes that Market Makers who trade Proprietary 
Products (including options on SPIKES) along with multi-listed classes 
will continue to not have Proprietary Products (including SPIKES) 
counted toward those Market Makers' class assignment count or 
percentage of total national average daily volume. This exclusion is 
noted with the symbol ``[Omega]'' following the table that shows the 
monthly Trading Permit fees currently assessed to Market Makers in 
Section 3)b) of the Fee Schedule.
API Testing and Certification Fee
    The Exchange assesses an API Testing and Certification fee to all 
Members depending upon Membership type. An API makes it possible for 
Members' software to communicate with MIAX software applications, and 
is subject to Members testing with, and certification by, MIAX. The 
Exchange offers four types of interfaces: (i) the Financial Information 
Exchange Port (``FIX Port''),\12\ which enables the FIX Port user 
(typically an EEM or a Market Maker) to submit simple and complex 
orders electronically to MIAX; (ii) the MEI Port, which enables Market 
Makers to submit simple and complex electronic quotes to MIAX; (iii) 
the
---------------------------------------------------------------------------

    \12\ A FIX Port is an interface with MIAX systems that enables 
the Port user (typically an Electronic Exchange Member or a Market 
Maker) to submit simple and complex orders electronically to MIAX. 
See Fee Schedule, Section 5)d)i).

---------------------------------------------------------------------------

[[Page 84863]]

Clearing Trade Drop Port (``CTD Port''),\13\ which provides real-time 
trade clearing information to the participants to a trade on MIAX and 
to the participants' respective clearing firms; and (iv) the FIX Drop 
Copy Port (``FXD Port''),\14\ which provides a copy of real-time trade 
execution, correction and cancellation information through a FIX Port 
to any number of FIX Ports designated by an EEM to receive such 
messages.
---------------------------------------------------------------------------

    \13\ Clearing Trade Drop (``CTD'') provides Exchange members 
with real-time clearing trade updates. The updates include the 
Member's clearing trade messages on a low latency, real-time basis. 
The trade messages are routed to a Member's connection containing 
certain information. The information includes, among other things, 
the following: (i) trade date and time; (ii) symbol information; 
(iii) trade price/size information; (iv) Member type (for example, 
and without limitation, Market Maker, Electronic Exchange Member, 
Broker-Dealer); (v) Exchange Member Participant Identifier 
(``MPID'') for each side of the transaction, including Clearing 
Member MPID; and (vi) strategy specific information for complex 
transactions. CTD Port Fees will be assessed in any month the Member 
is credentialed to use the CTD Port in the production environment. 
See Fee Schedule, Section 5)d)iii.
    \14\ The FIX Drop Copy Port (``FXD'') is a messaging interface 
that will provide a copy of real-time trade execution, trade 
correction and trade cancellation information for simple and complex 
orders to FIX Drop Copy Port users who subscribe to the service. FIX 
Drop Copy Port users are those users who are designated by an EEM to 
receive the information and the information is restricted for use by 
the EEM only. FXD Port Fees will be assessed in any month the Member 
is credentialed to use the FXD Port in the production environment. 
See Fee Schedule, Section 5)d)iv.
---------------------------------------------------------------------------

    API Testing and Certification fees for Market Makers are assessed 
(i) initially per API for CTD and MEI ports in the month the Market 
Maker has been credentialed to use one or more ports in the production 
environment for the tested API and the Market Maker has been assigned 
to quote in one or more classes, and (ii) each time a Market Maker 
initiates a change to its system that requires testing and 
certification. API Testing and Certification fees will not be assessed 
in situations where the Exchange initiates a mandatory change to the 
Exchange's system that requires testing and certification. The Exchange 
currently assesses a Market Maker an API Testing and Certification fee 
of $2,500. The API Testing and Certification fees represent costs 
incurred by the Exchange as it works with each Member for testing and 
certifying that the Member's software systems communicate properly with 
MIAX's interfaces.
    MIAX proposes to extend the waiver of the API Testing and 
Certification fee for Market Makers that trade solely in Proprietary 
Products (including options on SPIKES) from December 31, 2023 until 
June 30, 2024, which the Exchange proposes to state in the Fee 
Schedule. The purpose of this proposed change is to continue to provide 
an incentive for potential Market Makers to develop software 
applications to trade in Proprietary Products, including options on 
SPIKES. Even though the Exchange proposes to extend the waiver of this 
particular fee, the overall structure of the fee is outlined in the Fee 
Schedule so that there is general awareness that the Exchange intends 
to assess such a fee after June 30, 2024.
MEI Port Fees
    MIAX assesses monthly MEI Port fees to Market Makers in each month 
the Member has been credentialed to use the MEI Port in the production 
environment and has been assigned to quote in at least one class. The 
amount of the monthly MEI Port fee is based upon the number of classes 
in which the Market Maker was assigned to quote on any given day within 
the calendar month, and upon the class volume percentages set forth in 
the Fee Schedule. The class volume percentage is based on the total 
national average daily volume in classes listed on MIAX in the prior 
calendar quarter. Newly listed option classes are excluded from the 
calculation of the monthly MEI Port fee until the calendar quarter 
following their listing, at which time the newly listed option classes 
will be included in both the per class count and the percentage of 
total national average daily volume. The Exchange assesses MIAX Market 
Makers the monthly MEI Port fee based on the greatest number of classes 
listed on MIAX that the MIAX Market Maker was assigned to quote in on 
any given day within a calendar month and the applicable fee rate that 
is the lesser of either the per class basis or percentage of total 
national average daily volume measurement. MIAX assesses MEI Port fees 
on Market Makers according to the following table: \15\

 [Omega] Excludes Proprietary Products.
* For these Monthly MIAX MEI Fees levels, if the Market Maker's total
  monthly executed volume during the relevant month is less than 0.060%
  of the total monthly executed volume reported by OCC in the market
  maker account type for MIAX-listed option classes for that month, then
  the fee will be $14,500 instead of the fee otherwise applicable to
  such level.

    MIAX proposes to extend the waiver of the monthly MEI Port fee for 
Market Makers that trade solely in Proprietary Products (including 
options on SPIKES) from December 31, 2023 until June 30, 2024, which 
the Exchange proposes to state in the Fee Schedule. The purpose of this 
proposal is to continue to provide an incentive to Market Makers to 
connect to MIAX through the MEI Port such that they will be able to 
trade in MIAX Proprietary Products. Even though the Exchange proposes 
to extend the waiver of this particular fee, the overall structure of 
the fee is outlined in the Fee Schedule so that there is general 
awareness that the Exchange intends to assess such a fee after June 30, 
2024.
    The Exchange notes that for the purposes of this proposed change, 
other Market Makers who trade MIAX Proprietary Products (including 
options on SPIKES) along with multi-listed classes will continue to not 
have Proprietary Products (including SPIKES) counted toward those 
Market Makers' class assignment count or percentage of total national 
average daily volume. This exclusion is noted by the symbol ``[Omega]'' 
following the table that shows the monthly MEI Port Fees currently 
assessed for Market Makers in Section 5)d)ii) of the Fee Schedule.
    The proposed extension of the fee waivers are targeted at market 
participants, particularly market

[[Page 84864]]

makers, who are not currently members of MIAX, who may be interested in 
being a Market Maker in Proprietary Products on the Exchange. The 
Exchange estimates that there are fewer than ten (10) such market 
participants that could benefit from the extension of these fee 
waivers. The proposed extension of the fee waivers does not apply 
differently to different sizes of market participants, however the fee 
waivers do only apply to Market Makers (and not EEMs).
    Market Makers, unlike other market participants, take on a number 
of obligations, including quoting obligations that other market 
participants do not have. Further, Market Makers have added market 
making and regulatory requirements, which normally do not apply to 
other market participants. For example, Market Makers have obligations 
to maintain continuous markets, engage in a course of dealings 
reasonably calculated to contribute to the maintenance of a fair and 
orderly market, and to not make bids or offers or enter into 
transactions that are inconsistent with a course of dealing. 
Accordingly, the Exchange believes it is reasonable and not unfairly 
discriminatory to continue to offer the fee waivers to Market Makers 
because the Exchange is seeking additional liquidity providers for 
Proprietary Products, in order to enhance liquidity and spreads in 
Proprietary Products, which is traditionally provided by Market Makers, 
as opposed to EEMs.
2. Statutory Basis
    The Exchange believes that its proposal to amend its Fee Schedule 
is consistent with Section 6(b) of the Act \16\ in general, and 
furthers the objectives of Section 6(b)(4) of the Act \17\ in 
particular, in that it is an equitable allocation of reasonable fees 
and other charges among its Members and issuers and other persons using 
its facilities. The Exchange also believes the proposal furthers the 
objectives of Section 6(b)(5) of the Act in that it is designed to 
promote just and equitable principles of trade, to remove impediments 
to and perfect the mechanism of a free and open market and a national 
market system, and, in general to protect investors and the public 
interest and is not designed to permit unfair discrimination between 
customers, issuers, brokers and dealers.

    \17\ 15 U.S.C. 78f(b)(4) and (5).
---------------------------------------------------------------------------

    The Exchange believes that the proposal to extend the fee waiver 
period for certain non-transaction fees for Market Makers that trade 
solely in Proprietary Products is an equitable allocation of reasonable 
fees because the proposal continues to waive non-transaction fees for a 
limited period of time in order to enable the Exchange to improve its 
overall competitiveness and strengthen its market quality for all 
market participants in MIAX's Proprietary Products, including options 
on SPIKES. The Exchange believe the proposed extension of the fee 
waivers is fair and equitable and not unreasonably discriminatory 
because it applies to all market participants not currently registered 
as Market Makers at the Exchange. Any market participant may choose to 
satisfy the additional requirements and obligations of being a Market 
Maker and trade solely in Proprietary Products in order to qualify for 
the fee waivers.
    The Exchange believes that the proposed extension of the fee 
waivers is equitable and not unfairly discriminatory for Market Makers 
as compared to EEMs because Market Makers, unlike other market 
participants, take on a number of obligations, including quoting 
obligations that other market participants do not have. Further, Market 
Makers have added market making and regulatory requirements, which 
normally do not apply to other market participants. For example, Market 
Makers have obligations to maintain continuous markets, engage in a 
course of dealings reasonably calculated to contribute to the 
maintenance of a fair and orderly market, and to not make bids or 
offers or enter into transactions that are inconsistent with a course 
of dealing.
    The Exchange believes it is reasonable and equitable to continue to 
waive the one-time Membership Application Fee, monthly Trading Permit 
Fee, API Testing and Certification Fee, and monthly MEI Port Fee for 
Market Makers that trade solely in Proprietary Products (including 
options on SPIKES) until June 30, 2024, since the waiver of such fees 
provides incentives to interested market participants to trade in 
Proprietary Products. This should result in increasing potential order 
flow and liquidity in MIAX Proprietary Products, including options on 
SPIKES.
    The Exchange believes it is reasonable and equitable to continue to 
waive the API Testing and Certification fee assessable to Market Makers 
that trade solely in Proprietary Products (including options on SPIKES) 
until June 30, 2024, since the waiver of such fees provides incentives 
to interested Members to develop and test their APIs sooner. 
Determining system operability with the Exchange's system will in turn 
provide MIAX with potential order flow and liquidity providers in 
Proprietary Products.
    The Exchange believes it is reasonable, equitable and not unfairly 
discriminatory that Market Makers who trade in Proprietary Products 
along with multi-listed classes will continue to not have Proprietary 
Products counted toward those Market Makers' class assignment count or 
percentage of total national average daily volume for monthly Trading 
Permit Fees and monthly MEI Port Fees in order to incentivize existing 
Market Makers who currently trade in multi-listed classes to also trade 
in Proprietary Products, without incurring certain additional fees.
    The Exchange believes that the proposed extension of the fee 
waivers constitutes an equitable allocation of reasonable fees and 
other charges among its Members and issuers and other persons using its 
facilities. The proposed extension of the fee waivers means that all 
prospective market makers that wish to become Market Maker Members of 
the Exchange and quote solely in Proprietary Products may do so and 
have the above-mentioned fees waived until June 30, 2024. The proposed 
extension of the fee waivers will continue to not apply to potential 
EEMs because the Exchange is seeking to enhance the quality of its 
markets in Proprietary Products through introducing more competition 
among Market Makers in Proprietary Products. In order to increase the 
competition, the Exchange believes that it must continue to waive entry 
type fees for such Market Makers. EEMs do not provide the benefit of 
enhanced liquidity which is provided by Market Makers, therefore the 
Exchange believes it is reasonable and not unfairly discriminatory to 
continue to only offer the proposed fee waivers to Market Makers (and 
not EEMs). Further, the Exchange believes it is reasonable and not 
unfairly discriminatory to continue to exclude Proprietary Products 
from an existing Market Maker's permit fees and port fees, in order to 
incentive such Market Makers to quote in Proprietary Products. The 
amount of a Market Maker's permit and port fee is determined by the 
number of classes quoted and volume of the Market Maker. By excluding 
Proprietary Products from such fees, the Exchange is able to 
incentivize Market Makers to quote in Proprietary Products. EEMs do not 
pay permit and port fees based on the classes traded or volume, so the 
Exchange believes it is reasonable, equitable, and not unfairly 
discriminatory to only offer the

exclusion to Market Makers (and not EEMs).

B. Self-Regulatory Organization's Statement on Burden on Competition

    The Exchange does not believe that the proposed rule change will 
impose any burden on competition not necessary or appropriate in 
furtherance of the purposes of the Act.
Intra-Market Competition
    The Exchange believes that the proposal to extend certain of the 
non-transaction fee waivers until June 30, 2024 for Market Makers that 
trade solely in Proprietary Products would increase intra-market 
competition by incentivizing new potential Market Makers to quote in 
Proprietary Products, which will enhance the quality of quoting and 
increase the volume of contracts in Proprietary Products traded on 
MIAX, including options on SPIKES. To the extent that this purpose is 
achieved, all the Exchange's market participants should benefit from 
the improved market liquidity for the Exchange's Proprietary Products. 
Enhanced market quality and increased transaction volume in Proprietary 
Products that results from the anticipated increase in Market Maker 
activity on the Exchange will benefit all market participants and 
improve competition on the Exchange.
    The Exchange does not believe that the proposed rule change will 
impose any burden on intra-market competition that is not necessary or 
appropriate in furtherance of the purposes of the Act because the 
proposed changes for each separate type of market participant (new 
Market Makers and existing Market Makers) will be assessed equally to 
all such market participants. While different fees are assessed to 
different market participants in some circumstances, these different 
market participants have different obligations and different 
circumstances as discussed above. For example, Market Makers have 
quoting obligations that other market participants (such as EEMs) do 
not have.
Inter-Market Competition
    The Exchange does not believe that the proposed rule changes will 
impose any burden on inter-market competition that is not necessary or 
appropriate in furtherance of the purposes of the Act because the 
proposed extension of the fee waivers applies only to the Exchange's 
Proprietary Products (including options on SPIKES), which are traded 
exclusively on the Exchange.
