Self-Regulatory Organizations; NYSE Arca, Inc.; Notice of Filing 
of a Proposed Rule Change To Amend Rule 5.3-O To Permit the Listing and 
Trading of Options on Commodity-Based Trust Shares

1934 (``Act'') \2\ and Rule 19b-4 thereunder,\3\ notice is hereby given 
that, on January 16, 2024, NYSE Arca, Inc. (``NYSE Arca'' or 
``Exchange'') filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission

---------------------------------------------------------------------------

I. Self-Regulatory Organization's Statement of the Terms of Substance 
of the Proposed Rule Change

    The Exchange proposes to amend Rule 5.3-O to permit the listing and 
trading of options on Commodity-Based Trust Shares. The proposed rule 
change is available on the Exchange's website at <a href="http://www.nyse.com">www.nyse.com</a>, at the 
principal office of the Exchange, and at the Commission's Public 
Reference Room.

II. Self-Regulatory Organization's Statement of the Purpose of, and 
Statutory Basis for, the Proposed Rule Change

    In its filing with the Commission, the self-regulatory organization 
included statements concerning the purpose of, and basis for, the 
proposed rule change and discussed any comments it received on the 
proposed rule change. The text of those statements may be examined at 
the places specified in Item IV below. The Exchange has prepared 
summaries, set forth in sections A, B, and C below, of the most 
significant parts of such statements.

A. Self-Regulatory Organization's Statement of the Purpose of, and the 
Statutory Basis for, the Proposed Rule Change

1. Purpose
    NYSE Arca Rule 5.3-O, Criteria for Underlying Securities, provides 
for Exchange listing and trading of option contracts. The rule sets 
forth the criteria to be met by underlying securities with respect to 
which put or call option contracts are approved for listing and trading 
on the Exchange. The purpose of this filing is to amend NYSE Arca Rule 
5.3-O, and more specifically, NYSE Arca Rule 5.3-O(g) to permit the 
listing and trading of options on Commodity-Based Trust Shares.\4\
---------------------------------------------------------------------------

    \4\ The term ``Commodity-Based Trust Shares'' means a security 
(a) that is issued by a trust (``Trust'') that holds (1) a specified 
commodity deposited with the Trust, or (2) a specified commodity 
and, in addition to such specified commodity, cash; (b) that is 
issued by such Trust in a specified aggregate minimum number in 
return for a deposit of a quantity of the underlying commodity and/
or cash; and (c) that, when aggregated in the same specified minimum 
number, may be redeemed at a holder's request by such Trust which 
will deliver to the redeeming holder the quantity of the underlying 
commodity and/or cash. See NYSE Arca Rule 8.201-E(c)(1).
---------------------------------------------------------------------------

    Currently, Rule 5.3-O(g) deems appropriate for options trading 
Exchange-Traded Fund Shares (``ETFs'' or ``Fund Shares'') that are 
traded on a national securities exchange and are defined as an ``NMS 
stock'' in Rule 600(b)(55) of Regulation NMS, and that (i) represent an 
interest in a registered investment company organized as open-end 
management investment company, a unit investment trust or a similar 
entity which holds securities and/or financial instruments, options on 
securities and indices, equity caps, collars and floors, swap 
agreements, forward contracts, repurchase agreements and reverse 
purchase agreements (the ``Financial Instruments''), and money market 
instruments, including, but not limited to, U.S. government securities 
and repurchase agreements (the ``Money Market Instruments'') 
constituting or otherwise based on or representing an investment in an 
index or portfolio of securities and/or Financial Instruments and Money 
Market Instruments; or (ii) represent interests in a trust or similar 
entity that holds a specified non-U.S. currency deposited with the 
trust or similar entity when aggregated in some specified minimum 
number may be surrendered to the trust by the beneficial owner to 
receive the specified non-U.S. currency and pays the beneficial owner 
interest and other distributions on the deposited non-U.S. currency, if 
any, declared and paid by the trust; or (iii) represent commodity pool 
interests principally engaged, directly or indirectly, in holding and/
or managing portfolios or baskets of securities, commodity futures 
contracts, options on commodity futures contracts, swaps, forward 
contracts and/or options

[[Page 5030]]

on physical commodities and/or non-U.S. currency (``Commodity Pool 
Units''), or (iv) represent interests in the SPDR Gold Trust, or (v) 
represent interests in the iShares COMEX Gold Trust, or (vi) represent 
interests in the iShares Silver Trust, or, (vii) represents an interest 
in a registered investment company (``Investment Company'') organized 
as an open-end management investment company or similar entity, that 
invests in a portfolio of securities selected by the Investment 
Company's investment adviser consistent with the Investment Company's 
investment objectives and policies, which is issued in a specified 
aggregate minimum number in return for a deposit of a specified 
portfolio of securities and/or a cash amount with a value equal to the 
next determined net asset value (``NAV''), and when aggregated in the 
same specified minimum number, may be redeemed at a holder's request, 
which holder will be paid a specified portfolio of securities and/or 
cash with a value equal to the next determined NAV (``Managed Fund 
Share'') or, (viii) represents interest in the ETFS Silver Trust or the 
ETFS Gold Trust, or (ix) represents interests in the ETFS Palladium 
Trust or ETFS Platinum Trust.\5\ This rule change proposes to expand 
the type of ETFs that may be approved for options trading on the 
Exchange to include Commodity-Based Trust Shares \6\ without requiring 
a rule filing under Section 19(b) of the Act.\7\
---------------------------------------------------------------------------

    \5\ See NYSE Arca Rule 5.3-O(g).
    \6\ See NYSE Arca Rule 8.201-E(c)(1).
    \7\ 15 U.S.C. 78s(b).
---------------------------------------------------------------------------

    Apart from allowing Commodity-Based Trust Shares to be an 
underlying for options traded on the Exchange as described above, the 
listing standards for ETFs will remain unchanged from those that apply 
under current Exchange rules. ETFs on which options may be listed and 
traded must still be listed and traded on a national securities 
exchange and must satisfy the current listing standards set forth in 
NYSE Arca Rule 5.3-O.
    Commodity-Based Trust Shares are securities issued by a trust that 
represents investors' discrete identifiable and undivided beneficial 
ownership interest in the commodities deposited into the Trust. 
Commodity-Based Trust Shares, although based upon a publicly disclosed 
portfolio of securities, each trade as a single exchange-listed equity 
security. Accordingly, rules pertaining to the listing and trading of 
standard equity options will apply to options on Commodity-Based Trust 
Shares.
Listing Criteria
    The Exchange will consider listing and trading options on 
Commodity-Based Trust Shares provided the Commodity-Based Trust Shares 
meet (1) the criteria for underlying securities set forth in NYSE Arca 
Rule 5.3-O(a) \8\ -(b),\9\ or (2) the Commodity-Based Trust Shares are 
available for creation and redemption each business day as set forth in 
NYSE Arca Rule 5.3-O(g)(1)(B).
---------------------------------------------------------------------------

    \8\ See NYSE Arca Rule 5.3-O(a) which sets forth minimum 
requirements for the underlying security which include, but are not 
limited to, 7,000,000 underlying shares, 2,000 shareholders, and 
trading volume of 2,400,000 shares over the preceding twelve months. 
Additionally, the rule requires that the market price per share of 
the underlying security must be at least $7.50 for the majority of 
business days during the three calendar months preceding the date of 
selection of an option class. For underlying securities that are 
deemed Covered Securities, as defined under Section 18(b)(1)(A) of 
the Securities Act of 1933, the closing market price of the 
underlying security must be at least $3.00 per share for the 
previous three consecutive business days prior to the date of 
selection of an option class.
    \9\ See NYSE Arca Rule 5.3-O(b) which states that the underlying 
securities shall be registered and be an ``NMS Stock'' as defined in 
Rule 600 of Regulation NMS under the Act.
---------------------------------------------------------------------------

    The Exchange proposes that Commodity-Based Trust Shares deemed 
appropriate for options trading represent an interest in a trust, as 
described below:
    <bullet> Commodity-Based Trust Shares are securities (a) that are 
issued by a trust (``Trust'') that holds (1) a specified commodity 
deposited with the Trust, or (2) a specified commodity and, in addition 
to such specified commodity, cash; (b) that is issued by such Trust in 
a specified aggregate minimum number in return for a deposit of a 
quantity of the underlying commodity and/or cash; and (c) that, when 
aggregated in the same specified minimum number, may be redeemed at a 
holder's request by such Trust which will deliver to the redeeming 
holder the quantity of the underlying commodity and/or cash.\10\
---------------------------------------------------------------------------

    \10\ See NYSE Arca Rule 8.201-E(c)(1).
---------------------------------------------------------------------------

    Additionally, the Exchange proposes that options on Commodity-Based 
Trust Shares may only be listed and traded on the Exchange if the 
underlying security has been reviewed and approved by the Securities 
and Exchange Commission under Section 19(b)(2) of the Act or noticed 
for immediate effectiveness under Section 19(b)(3)(A) of the Act, as 
applicable. Pursuant to Commission approval, the Exchange currently 
lists and trades 18 Commodity-Based Trust Shares.\11\ While the 
Exchange's rules currently provide for the listing of options on a 
limited number of such Commodity-Based Trust Shares,\12\ this proposed 
rule change would permit listing options on any Commodity-Based Trust 
Share, including the 11 Commodity-Based Trust Shares that have been 
approved for listing and trading by the Commission but are not 
currently eligible for options trading.
---------------------------------------------------------------------------

    \11\ See e.g. Securities Exchange Act Release Nos. 94518 (March 
25, 2022), 87 FR 18837 (March 31, 2022) (Notice of Filing of 
Amendment No. 1 and Order Granting Accelerated Approval of a 
Proposed Rule Change, as Modified by Amendment No. 1, To List and 
Trade Shares of the Sprott ESG Gold ETF Under NYSE Arca Rule 8.201-E 
(Commodity-Based Trust Shares) (SR-NYSEArca-2021-65); 82249 
(December 8, 2017), 82 FR 58884 (December 14, 2017) (Notice of 
Filing of Amendment No. 2 and Order Approving on an Accelerated 
Basis a Proposed Rule Change, as Modified by Amendment No. 2, To 
List and Trade Shares of the GraniteShares Platinum Trust Under NYSE 
Arca Rule 8.201-E) (SR-NYSEArca-2017-110); 68430 (December 13, 
2012), 77 FR 75239 (December 19, 2012) (Order Approving a Proposed 
Rule Change, as Modified by Amendment No. 1, To List and Trade Units 
of the Sprott Physical Platinum and Palladium Trust Pursuant to NYSE 
Arca Equities Rule 8.201) (SR-NYSEArca-2012-111); and 63043 (October 
5, 2010), 75 FR 62615 (Notice of Filing and Order Granting 
Accelerated Approval of a Proposed Rule Change To List and Trade 
Shares of the Sprott Physical Silver Trust) (SR-NYSEArca-2010-84).
    \12\ See NYSE Arca Rule 5.3-O(g)(iv) which permits the listing 
and trading of options on the SPDR Gold Trust; NYSE Arca Rule 5.3-
O(g)(v) which permits the listing and trading of options on the 
iShares COMEX Gold Trust; NYSE Arca Rule 5.3-O(g)(vi) which permits 
the listing and trading of options on the iShares Silver Trust; NYSE 
Arca Rule 5.3-O(g)(viii) which permits the listing and trading of 
options on the ETFS Silver Trust or ETFS Gold Trust; and NYSE Arca 
Rule 5.3-O(g)(ix) which permits the listing and trading of options 
on the ETFS Palladium Trust or ETFS Platinum Trust.
---------------------------------------------------------------------------

Continued Listing Requirements
    The Exchange represents that the current continued listing 
standards for options on Exchange-Traded Fund Shares will apply to 
options on Commodity-Based Trust Shares. Specifically, under NYSE Arca 
Rule 5.4-O(k), options on Exchange-Traded Fund Shares may be subject to 
the suspension of opening transactions as follows: (1) the Commodity-
Based Trust Share no longer meets the terms of paragraphs 1 through 4 
of Rule 5.4-O(b); (2) following the initial twelve-month period 
beginning upon the commencement of trading of the Exchange-Traded Fund 
Shares, there are fewer than 50 record and/or beneficial holders of the 
Exchange-Traded Fund Shares for 30 or more consecutive trading days; 
(3) the value of the underlying commodity is no longer calculated or 
available; or (4) such other event occurs or condition exists that in 
the opinion of the Exchange makes further dealing on the Exchange 
inadvisable. Additionally, Commodity-Based Trust Shares shall not be 
deemed to meet the requirements for continued approval, and the 
Exchange shall not open for trading any additional series of option 
contracts covering Commodity-

[[Page 5031]]

Based Trust Shares if such security ceases to be an ``NMS stock'' as 
provided for in NYSE Arca Rule 5.4-O(b)(5) or the Commodity-Based Trust 
Share is halted from trading on its primary market.\13\
---------------------------------------------------------------------------

    \13\ See NYSE Arca Rule 5.4-O(k).
---------------------------------------------------------------------------

    Finally, all options on Commodity-Based Trust Shares listed 
pursuant to proposed Rule 5.3-O(g)(x) would be included within the 
definition of securities as such terms are used in the Exchange's rules 
and, as such, would be subject to Exchange rules and procedures that 
currently govern the trading of securities on the Exchange, including 
Exchange rules governing the trading of equity options. Furthermore, 
the Exchange's rules pertaining to position and exercise limits \14\ or 
margin \15\ shall apply to options on Commodity-Based Trust Shares.
---------------------------------------------------------------------------

    \14\ Pursuant to NYSE Arca Rule 6.8-O, Commentary .05 and .06, 
Commodity-Based Trust Shares are subject to the same position limits 
applicable to options on stocks and Exchange-Traded Fund Shares. 
NYSE Arca Rule 6.9-O stipulates that exercise limits for options on 
stocks and other securities, including Commodity-Based Trust Shares, 
shall be the same as the position limits applicable under NYSE Arca 
Rule 6.8-O.
    \15\ See NYSE Arca Rules 4.15-O(a)--4.16-O(d), the Exchange's 
rules governing margin.
---------------------------------------------------------------------------

    The Exchange notes that options on Commodity-Based Trust Shares 
would not be available for trading until The Options Clearing 
Corporation (``OCC'') represents to the Exchange that it is fully able 
to clear and settle such options. The Exchange has also analyzed its 
capacity and represents that it and The Options Price Reporting 
Authority (``OPRA'') have the necessary systems capacity to handle the 
additional traffic associated with the listing of options on Commodity-
Based Trust Shares.\16\ The Exchange believes any additional traffic 
that would be generated from the trading of options on Commodity-Based 
Trust Shares would be manageable. The Exchange represents that Exchange 
members will not have a capacity issue as a result of this proposed 
rule change.
---------------------------------------------------------------------------

    \16\ OPRA is a securities information processor registered in 
accordance with Section 11A(b) of the Exchange Act. OPRA's members 
consist of the national securities exchanges that have been approved 
by the Commission to provide markets for the listing and trading of 
exchange-traded securities options.
---------------------------------------------------------------------------

    The Exchange believes that its surveillance procedures are adequate 
to properly monitor the trading of options on Commodity-Based Trust 
Shares in all trading sessions and to deter and detect violations of 
Exchange rules. The Exchange will utilize its existing surveillance 
procedures applicable to options on exchange traded funds (which will 
include Commodity-Based Trust Shares) to monitor such trading. In 
addition, the Exchange will implement any new surveillance procedures 
it deems necessary to effectively monitor the trading of options on 
Commodity-Based Trust Shares, including adequate comprehensive 
surveillance sharing agreements (``CSSA'') with markets trading in non-
U.S. components,\17\ as applicable. Also, the Exchange may obtain 
trading information via the Intermarket Surveillance Group (``ISG'') 
\18\ from other exchanges who are members or affiliates of the ISG. The 
Exchange represents that these procedures will be adequate to properly 
monitor Exchange trading of options on Commodity-Based Trust Shares and 
to deter and detect violations of Exchange rules.
---------------------------------------------------------------------------

    \17\ See NYSE Arca Rule 5.3-O(g)(2), the Exchange's rule 
governing the applicable CSSA requirements for options on exchange-
traded funds. The Exchange notes that any non-U.S. component 
securities (including fixed-income) in an index or portfolio of 
securities on which Exchange-Traded Fund Shares are based that are 
not subject to comprehensive surveillance agreements may in the 
aggregate represent an amount equal to 50% of the weight of the 
index or portfolio.
    \18\ A complete list of the current members of the ISG, is 
available at <a href="http://www.isgportal.org">http://www.isgportal.org</a>.
---------------------------------------------------------------------------

    Finally, quotation and last sale information for Commodity-Based 
Trust Shares is available via the Consolidated Tape Association 
(``CTA'') high speed line. Quotation and last sale information for such 
securities is also available from the exchange on which such securities 
are listed. Quotation and last sale information for options on 
Commodity-Based Trust Shares will be available via OPRA \19\ and major 
market data vendors.
---------------------------------------------------------------------------

    \19\ Last sale reports and quotations are the core of the 
information that OPRA disseminates. OPRA also disseminates certain 
other types of information with respect to the trading of options on 
the markets of the OPRA participants, such as the number of options 
contracts traded, open interest and end of day summaries. OPRA also 
disseminates certain kinds of administrative messages.
---------------------------------------------------------------------------

    The Exchange notes that the Commission has previously approved 
generic listing standards pursuant to Rule 19b-4(e) of the Act \20\ for 
ETFs based on indexes that consist of stocks listed on U.S. 
exchanges.\21\ In addition, the Commission has previously approved 
proposals for the listing and trading of options on ETFs based on 
international indexes as well as global indexes (e.g., based on non-
U.S. and U.S. component stocks).\22\ In approving Commodity-Based Trust 
Shares for equities exchange trading, the Commission thoroughly 
considered the structure of the Commodity-Based Trust Shares, their 
usefulness to investors and to the markets, and SRO rules that govern 
their trading. The Exchange believes that allowing the listing of 
options overlying Commodity-Based Trust Shares that are listed pursuant 
to Commission approval on equities exchanges and applying Rule 19b-4(e) 
\23\ should fulfill the intended objective of that rule by allowing 
options on those Commodity-Based Trust Shares that have satisfied the 
generic listing standards to commence trading, without the need for the 
public comment period and Commission approval. The proposed rule change 
has the potential to significantly reduce the time frame and costs 
associated with bringing options on Commodity-Based Trust Shares to 
market, thereby reducing the burden on issuers and other market 
participants, while also promoting competition among options exchanges, 
to the benefit of the investing public. The failure of a particular 
Commodity-Based Trust Share to comply with the generic listing 
standards under Rule 19b-4(e) \24\ would not, however, preclude the 
Exchange from submitting a separate filing pursuant to Section 
19(b)(2),\25\ requesting Commission approval to list and trade options 
on a particular Commodity-Based Trust Share.

---------------------------------------------------------------------------

    The Exchange believes that the proposed rule change would promote 
transparency surrounding the listing process for options on Commodity-
Based Trust Shares. Exchange listing standards play a critical role in 
ensuring transparency in the market. Adopting objective criteria, such 
as those that would be applicable for the listing and trading of 
options on Commodity-Based Trust Shares would help investors to make 
informed decisions about which options to invest in and would provide a 
level of transparency that is essential for a well-functioning market.
    The Exchange also believes that the standards for listing and 
trading options

[[Page 5032]]

on Commodity-Based Trust Shares are reasonably designed to promote a 
fair and orderly market for such securities. As ETFs have grown in 
popularity, so has the ability to trade options on them. The Exchange 
believes the proposed rule change will benefit investors and market 
participants generally by shortening the time to list and trade options 
on Commodity-Based Trust Shares that have been approved by the 
Commission by not requiring the Exchange to submit a separate proposed 
rule change. The Exchange believes that the proposed rule change will 
facilitate the listing and trading of options on additional ETFs that 
will enhance competition among market participants, to the benefit of 
investors and the marketplace.
2. Statutory Basis
    The Exchange believes that its proposed rule change is consistent 
with Section 6(b) of the Act \26\ in general, and furthers the 
objectives of Section 6(b)(5) of the Act \27\ in particular, in that it 
is designed to promote just and equitable principles of trade, to 
remove impediments to and perfect the mechanisms of a free and open 
market and a national market system. In particular, the proposed rule 
change has the potential to reduce the time frame for bringing options 
on Commodity-Based Trust Shares to market, thereby reducing the burdens 
on issuers and other market participants, while also promoting 
competition among options exchanges, to the benefit of the investing 
public. The Exchange believes that enabling the listing and trading of 
options on Commodity-Based Trust Shares without requiring a rule filing 
under Section 19(b) of the Act \28\ would remove impediments to and 
perfect the mechanism of a free and open market and a national market 
system.

    \27\ 15 U.S.C. 78f(b)(5).
    \28\ 15 U.S.C. 78s(b).
---------------------------------------------------------------------------

    The Exchange believes the proposed rule change will also result in 
increased competition as other exchanges will likely adopt an identical 
rule to the one proposed by the Exchange that would allow the listing 
and trading of options on Commodity-Based Trust Shares that are 
approved for trading on those other markets. Multiple listing of ETFs, 
options and other securities and competition are some of the central 
features of the national market system. The Exchange believes that the 
proposal would encourage a more open market and national market system 
based on competition and multiple listing.
    The proposed rule change adds an additional listing mechanism for 
certain qualifying options on ETFs to be listed on the Exchange in a 
manner that is designed to prevent fraudulent and manipulative acts and 
practices, to promote just and equitable principles of trade, to remove 
impediments to and perfect the mechanisms of a free and open market and 
a national market system and, in general, to protect investors and the 
general public.
    The Exchange further believes that the proposed rules applicable to 
trading pursuant to generic listing and trading criteria, together with 
the Exchange's surveillance procedures applicable to trading in the 
securities covered by the proposed rules, serve to remove impediments 
to and perfect the mechanism of a free and open market and a national 
market system.
    The Exchange has an adequate surveillance program in place to 
detect manipulative trading in options on Commodity-Based Trust Shares. 
The Exchange represents that it and OPRA have the necessary systems 
capacity to support new options series that would be listed and traded 
pursuant to this proposed rule change.

B. Self-Regulatory Organization's Statement on Burden on Competition

    The Exchange does not believe that the proposed rule change will 
impose any burden on competition that is not necessary or appropriate 
in furtherance of the purposes of the Act. To the contrary, the 
Exchange believes that the proposal is, as discussed, pro-competitive 
and is a competitive response to the Exchange's inability to list 
options on Commodity-Based Trust Shares without submitting a separate 
proposed rule change. The Exchange believes the proposed rule change 
will result in additional investment options and opportunities to 
achieve the investment objectives of market participants seeking 
efficient trading and hedging vehicles, to the benefit of investors, 
market participants, and the marketplace in general. Competition is one 
of the principal features of the national market system. The Exchange 
believes that this proposal will expand competitive opportunities to 
list and trade products on the Exchange as noted.
    The Exchange does not believe the proposal will impose any burden 
on intra-market competition, as all market participants will be treated 
in the same manner under this proposal. Additionally, the Exchange does 
not believe the proposal will impose any burden on inter-market 
competition, as nothing prevents the other options exchanges from 
proposing similar rules to list and trade options on Commodity-Based 
Trust Shares. In fact, the Exchange believes other options exchanges 
will adopt an identical rule so that they may also list and trade 
options on Commodity-Based Trust Shares without submitting a separate 
proposed rule change.

C. Self-Regulatory Organization's Statement on Comments on the Proposed 
Rule Change Received From Members, Participants, or Others

    No written comments were solicited or received with respect to the 
proposed rule change.

III. Date of Effectiveness of the Proposed Rule Change and Timing for 
Commission Action

    Within 45 days of the date of publication of this notice in the 
Federal Register or within such longer period up to 90 days (i) as the 
Commission may designate if it finds such longer period to be 
appropriate and publishes its reasons for so finding or (ii) as to 
which the self-regulatory organization consents, the Commission will:
    (A) by order approve or disapprove the proposed rule change, or
    (B) institute proceedings to determine whether the proposed rule 
change should be disapproved.

IV. Solicitation of Comments

    Interested persons are invited to submit written data, views and 
arguments concerning the foregoing, including whether the proposed rule 
change is consistent with the Act. Comments may be submitted by any of 
the following methods:
