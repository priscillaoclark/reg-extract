SECURITIES AND EXCHANGE COMMISSION

[SEC File No. 270-126, OMB Control No. 3235-0287]


Proposed Collection; Comment Request; Extension: Form 4--
Statement of Changes in Beneficial Ownership of Securities

Upon Written Request Copies Available From: Securities and Exchange 
Commission, Office of FOIA Services, 100 F Street NE, Washington, DC 
20549-2736

    Notice is hereby given that, pursuant to the Paperwork Reduction 
Act of 1995 (44 U.S.C. 3501 et seq.), the Securities and Exchange 
Commission (``Commission'') is soliciting comments on the collection of 
information summarized below. The Commission plans to submit this 
existing collection of information to the Office of Management and 
Budget for extension and approval.
    Under Section 16(a) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 
(``Exchange Act'') (15 U.S.C. 78a et seq.) every person who is directly 
or indirectly the beneficial owner of more than 10 percent of any class 
of any equity security (other than an exempted security) which 
registered under Section 12 of the Exchange Act (15 U.S.C. 78l), or who 
is a director or an officer of the issuer of such security 
(collectively ``insiders''), must file a statement with the Commission 
reporting their ownership. Form 4 is a statement to disclose changes in 
an insider's ownership of securities. The information is used for the 
purpose of disclosing the equity holdings of insiders of reporting 
companies. Approximately 186,052 insiders file Form 4 annually and it 
takes approximately 0.5 hours to prepare for a total of 93,026 annual 
burden hours (0.5 hours per response x 186,052 responses).
    Written comments are invited on: (a) whether this proposed 
collection of information is necessary for the proper performance of 
the functions of the agency, including whether the information will 
have practical utility; (b) the accuracy of the agency's estimate of 
the burden imposed by the collection of information; (c) ways to 
enhance the quality, utility, and clarity of the information collected; 
and (d) ways to minimize the burden of the collection of information on 
respondents, including through the use of automated collection 
techniques or other forms of information technology. Consideration will 
be given to comments and suggestions submitted in writing within 60 
days of this publication by October 15, 2024.
    An agency may not conduct or sponsor, and a person is not required 
to respond to, a collection of information unless it displays a 
currently valid control number.
    Please direct your written comment to Austin Gerig, Director/Chief 
Data Officer, Securities and Exchange Commission, c/o Oluwaseun Ajayi, 
100 F Street NE, Washington, DC 20549 or send an email to:
