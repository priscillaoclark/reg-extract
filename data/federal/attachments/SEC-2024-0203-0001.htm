I. Self-Regulatory Organization's Statement of the Terms of Substance 
of the Proposed Rule Change

    FINRA is proposing to adopt FINRA Rule 6897(b) (CAT Cost Recovery 
Fees) to implement a historical Consolidated Audit Trail (``CAT'') 
recovery assessment through which FINRA would recoup its contributions 
to recoverable historical CAT costs incurred prior to January 1, 
2022.\5\
---------------------------------------------------------------------------

    \5\ Pursuant to Section 11.3(b) of the CAT NMS Plan, FINRA filed 
a separate proposed rule change to establish fees assessed to 
Industry Members, payable to Consolidated Audit Trail, LLC, related 
to recoverable historical CAT costs incurred prior to January 1, 
2022. See File No. SR-FINRA-2024-002. Unless otherwise specified, 
capitalized terms used in this rule filing are defined as set forth 
in the CAT NMS Plan and FINRA Rule 6800 Series (Consolidated Audit 
Trail Compliance Rule).
---------------------------------------------------------------------------

    The text of the proposed rule change is available on FINRA's 
website at <a href="http://www.finra.org">http://www.finra.org</a>, at the principal office of FINRA and 
at the Commission's Public Reference Room.

II. Self-Regulatory Organization's Statement of the Purpose of, and 
Statutory Basis for, the Proposed Rule Change

    In its filing with the Commission, FINRA included statements 
concerning the purpose of and basis for the proposed rule change and 
discussed any comments it received on the proposed rule change. The 
text of these statements may be examined at the places specified in 
Item V below. FINRA has prepared summaries, set forth in sections A, B, 
and C below, of the most significant aspects of such statements.

A. Self-Regulatory Organization's Statement of the Purpose of, and 
Statutory Basis for, the Proposed Rule Change

1. Purpose
Background
    On July 11, 2012, the Commission adopted Rule 613 of Regulation 
NMS, which required the self-regulatory organizations (``SROs'') to 
submit a national market system (``NMS'') plan to create, implement and 
maintain a consolidated audit trail that would capture customer and 
order event information for orders in NMS securities across all 
markets, from the time of order inception through routing, 
cancellation, modification, or execution.\6\ On November 15, 2016, the 
Commission approved the CAT NMS Plan (``Plan'' or ``CAT NMS Plan'').\7\ 
Under the CAT NMS Plan, the Operating Committee has the discretion to 
establish funding for Consolidated Audit Trail, LLC (``CAT LLC'') to 
operate the CAT, including establishing fees for Industry Members to be 
assessed by CAT LLC that would be implemented on behalf of CAT LLC by 
the Participants.\8\ The Operating Committee adopted a revised funding 
model to fund the CAT (``CAT Funding Model'') and, on September 6, 
2023, the Commission approved the CAT Funding Model, after concluding 
that the model was reasonable and that it satisfied the requirements of 
Section 11A of the Exchange Act and Rule 608 thereunder.\9\
---------------------------------------------------------------------------

    \6\ See Securities Exchange Act Release No. 67457 (July 18, 
2012), 77 FR 45721 (August 1, 2012).
    \7\ See Securities Exchange Act Release No. 79318 (November 15, 
2016), 81 FR 84696 (November 23, 2016) (``CAT NMS Plan Approval 
Order'').
    \8\ See Section 11.1(b) of the CAT NMS Plan.
    \9\ See Securities Exchange Act Release No. 98290 (September 6, 
2023), 88 FR 62628 (September 12, 2023) (``CAT Funding Model 
Approval Order'').
---------------------------------------------------------------------------

    The CAT Funding Model provides a framework for the recovery of the 
costs to create, develop, and maintain the CAT, including providing a 
method for allocating costs to fund the CAT among Participants and 
Industry Members. The CAT Funding Model establishes two categories of 
fees: (1) CAT fees assessed by CAT LLC and payable by certain Industry 
Members to recover a portion of historical CAT costs previously paid by 
the Participants (``Historical CAT Assessment'' fees); \10\ and (2) CAT 
fees assessed by CAT LLC and payable by Participants and Industry 
Members to fund prospective CAT costs.\11\ With respect to Historical 
CAT Assessment fees, to date, the CAT Operating Committee has 
established Historical CAT Assessment 1 with regard to historical CAT 
costs incurred prior to January 1, 2022 (``Historical CAT Costs 
1'').\12\
---------------------------------------------------------------------------

    \10\ See Section 11.3(b) of the CAT NMS Plan.
    \11\ See Section 11.3(a) of the CAT NMS Plan.
    \12\ See File No. SR-FINRA-2024-002.
---------------------------------------------------------------------------

    In light of the approval of the CAT Funding Model and the filing of 
File No. SR-FINRA-2024-002, FINRA is similarly filing the instant 
proposed rule change to establish a fee to allow FINRA to recoup its 
contributions to the Participants' assessed share of Historical CAT 
Costs 1 (``Historical CAT Cost Recovery Assessment 1''). Historical CAT 
Cost Recovery Assessment 1 is designed to allow FINRA to recover its 
designated portion of Historical CAT Costs 1--amounting to $4,613,250--
in a manner consistent with the Exchange Act and the CAT Funding Model 
Approval Order. In the Approval Order, the Commission acknowledged that 
``the Exchange Act expressly contemplates the ability of the 
Participants to recoup their costs to fulfill their statutory 
obligations under the Exchange Act.'' \13\ The Commission also noted 
FINRA's statement ``that it would file a rule change to increase its 
member fees with the filing of any proposed rule change to effectuate 
the Funding Model.'' \14\ Given the approval of the CAT Funding Model 
and FINRA's proposed rule change to establish Historical CAT Assessment 
1 to effectuate the CAT Funding Model,\15\ FINRA is submitting this 
filing to implement Historical CAT Cost Recovery Assessment 1.\16\
---------------------------------------------------------------------------

    \13\ CAT Funding Model Approval Order, 88 FR 62628, 62636-37.
    \14\ FINRA has consistently made clear its intention to file a 
rule change to implement member CAT fees simultaneous with the 
filing of any proposed rule change to effectuate the CAT Funding 
Model. See Letter from Marcia E. Asquith, Corporate Secretary, EVP, 
Board and External Relations, FINRA, to Vanessa Countryman, 
Secretary, Commission, dated April 11, 2023 (``FINRA April 2023 
Letter'') at 7 (``If the Funding Model is approved by the 
Commission, FINRA intends to file a rule change to increase member 
fees simultaneous with the filing of any proposed rule change to 
effectuate the Funding Model.''); see also Letter from Marcia E. 
Asquith, Corporate Secretary, EVP, Board and External Relations, 
FINRA, to Vanessa Countryman, Secretary, Commission, dated June 22, 
2022 (``FINRA June 2022 Letter'') at 6 (``[G]iven FINRA's unique 
nature, FINRA necessarily must seek recovery in turn for the costs 
it is allocated.''). FINRA also requested that if the Commission 
were to approve the CAT Funding Model, that it acknowledge ``FINRA's 
need and ability to cover CAT costs that are not recovered through 
contractual arrangements through member fee increases, so as not to 
jeopardize FINRA's ability to carry out its critical regulatory 
mission.'' See CAT Funding Model Approval Order, 88 FR 62628, 62645.
    \15\ See File No. SR-FINRA-2024-002.
    \16\ The CAT NMS Plan states that ``[n]o Participant will make a 
filing with the SEC pursuant to Section 19(b) of the Exchange Act 
regarding any Historical CAT Assessment until any applicable 
Financial Accountability Milestone described in Section 11.6 has 
been satisfied.'' See Section 11.3(b)(iii)(B)(III) of the CAT NMS 
Plan. The CAT NMS Plan further states that ``in all filings 
submitted by the Participants to the Commission under Section 19(b) 
of the Exchange Act, to establish or implement Post-Amendment 
Industry Member Fees pursuant to this Article, . . . the 
Participants shall clearly indicate whether such fees are related to 
Post-Amendment Expenses incurred during Period 1, Period 2, Period 
3, or Period 4.'' See Section 11.6(b) of the CAT NMS Plan. As 
discussed in File No. SR-FINRA-2024-002, all applicable Financial 
Accountability Milestones for Historical CAT Assessment 1 and, by 
extension, Historical CAT Cost Recovery Assessment 1--that is, 
Period 1, Period 2, and Period 3 of the Financial Accountability 
Milestones--have been satisfied. Furthermore, the costs sought to be 
recovered via both Historical CAT Assessment 1 and Historical CAT 
Cost Recovery Assessment 1 relate to Post-Amendment Expenses 
incurred during Periods 1, 2 and 3 of the Financial Accountability 
Milestones.

---------------------------------------------------------------------------

[[Page 11155]]

FINRA's Portion of Historical CAT Costs 1
    As discussed in File No. SR-FINRA-2024-002, which seeks to 
implement Historical CAT Assessment 1,\17\ to date, FINRA and the other 
Participants have agreed to pay all Past CAT Costs via loans to CAT 
LLC. Specifically, in the absence of an SEC-approved model establishing 
how the Participants were to fund the creation, implementation, and 
maintenance of the CAT, in 2017, FINRA and the other Participants 
unanimously agreed to apportion all CAT operational costs amongst the 
group and to fund the CAT through a series of interest-free loans. 
Through these loans, FINRA contributed $13,839,748 or roughly 4.1% 
toward the $337,688,610 in operating expenses composing Historical CAT 
Costs 1. Of that approximately $13.8 million expenditure, FINRA expects 
to recover $9,226,499 in loan repayments from CAT LLC following 
implementation of Historical CAT Assessment 1, and, under the CAT 
Funding Model, will forgive the remaining $4,613,250, which FINRA now 
seeks to recover through the implementation of Historical CAT Cost 
Recovery Assessment 1.\18\
---------------------------------------------------------------------------

    \17\ Historical CAT Assessment 1 seeks to recover from CAT 
Executing Brokers two-thirds of Historical CAT Costs 1--the 
$337,688,610 in recoverable costs incurred by CAT LLC prior to 
January 1, 2022. Participants collectively will remain responsible 
for one-third of Historical CAT Costs 1 or $112,562,870.
    \18\ FINRA notes that, as is the case with respect to Historical 
CAT Assessment 1 discussed in File No. SR-FINRA-2024-002, FINRA's 
recovery under the instant proposed rule change also would not 
include any portion of Excluded Costs, i.e., $48,874,937 of costs 
incurred from November 15, 2017 through November 15, 2018, and 
$14,749,362 of costs related to the termination of the relationship 
with the Initial Plan Processor. See CAT Funding Model Approval 
Order, 88 FR 62628, 62660 n704.
---------------------------------------------------------------------------

    The following table illustrates FINRA's approximate contributions 
to the Plan Participants' collective one-third share of Historical CAT 
Costs 1 during each of the relevant periods.\19\
---------------------------------------------------------------------------

    \19\ A detailed description (including the amounts) of all costs 
incurred by the Participants during the pre-FAM period (prior to 
June 22, 2020) and during each relevant FAM period, i.e., FAM Period 
1, FAM Period 2, and FAM Period 3, is provided in File No. SR-FINRA-
2024-002.
[GRAPHIC] [TIFF OMITTED] TN13FE24.072

    FINRA's recovery of these approximately $4.6 million in CAT costs 
is reasonable and consistent with the Exchange Act. As discussed herein 
and in File No. SR-FINRA-2024-002, these costs incurred by FINRA were 
necessary to fund the design, implementation, and maintenance of the 
CAT. The approximately 4.1% of the Participants' share of Historical 
CAT Costs 1 borne by FINRA is significantly smaller than the 
approximately 34% of the Participants' share of Prospective CAT costs 
to be borne by FINRA under the SEC-approved CAT funding model.\20\ As 
stated by FINRA and permitted under the Exchange Act, FINRA will seek 
to recover its portion of the Participants' share of CAT costs to 
ensure that FINRA can fulfill its regulatory mandate and 
responsibilities.
---------------------------------------------------------------------------

    \20\ See FINRA April 2023 Letter, supra note 14, at 3 (noting 
that, under the CAT Funding Model, FINRA ``would be assessed an 
estimated 34% of the total CAT costs to be borne amongst the 25 SRO 
Plan Participants (based on 2021 data).'').
---------------------------------------------------------------------------

Historical CAT Cost Recovery Assessment 1
    FINRA is proposing to adopt Rule 6897(b) (CAT Cost Recovery Fees) 
to implement Historical CAT Cost Recovery Assessment 1 at this time to 
allow FINRA to recover its contributions to the Participants' one-third 
share of Historical CAT Costs 1.\21\ FINRA intends that the fee 
framework for, and the commencement of payment of, the Historical CAT 
Cost Recovery Assessment 1 would correspond to the framework put in 
place under the SEC-approved CAT Funding Model and the timing for the 
commencement of Historical CAT Assessment 1, as provided for in File 
No. SR-FINRA-2024-002. Thus, as with Historical CAT Assessment 1, FINRA 
proposes that each member CAT Executing Broker shall receive its first 
invoice for Historical CAT Cost Recovery Assessment 1 in April 2024, 
setting forth fees calculated based on March 2024 transactions in 
Eligible Securities executed otherwise than on an exchange, as 
reflected in CAT Data. Consistent with the approach taken under the CAT 
Funding Model, FINRA proposes to equally apportion one-third of 
Historical Fee Rate 1 between the member CAT Executing Broker for the 
Buyer (``CEBB'') and the member CAT Executing Broker for the Seller 
(``CEBS'') for each transaction in Eligible Securities executed 
otherwise than on an exchange.\22\ The following fields of

[[Page 11156]]

the Participant Technical Specifications indicate the CAT Executing 
Brokers for transactions executed otherwise than on an exchange.
---------------------------------------------------------------------------

    \21\ In approving the CAT Funding Model, the Commission noted 
that it ``believe[d] that FINRA's allocation of CAT fees likely will 
be passed through to Industry Members.'' See CAT Funding Model 
Approval Order, 88 FR 62628, 62684.
    \22\ As per Section 1.1 of the Plan, for a transaction in an 
Eligible Security executed otherwise than on an exchange and 
required to be reported to an equity trade reporting facility of a 
registered national securities association, i.e., one of FINRA's 
Trade Reporting Facilities (each a ``TRF''), OTC Reporting Facility 
(``ORF'') or Alternative Display Facility (``ADF''), the CEBB and 
CEBS are the Industry Members identified as the executing broker and 
the contra-side executing broker in the TRF/ORF/ADF transaction data 
event in CAT Data. In those circumstances where there is a non-
Industry Member identified as the contra-side executing broker in 
the TRF/ORF/ADF transaction data event or no contra-side executing 
broker is identified in the TRF/ORF/ADF transaction data event, then 
the Industry Member identified as the executing broker in the TRF/
ORF/ADF transaction data event would be treated as, and be required 
to pay the fee assessed to, both the CEBB and CEBS.
[GRAPHIC] [TIFF OMITTED] TN13FE24.073

    As discussed in File No. SR-FINRA-2024-002, the Operating Committee 
has determined that Historical Fee Rate 1 is $0.0000439371316687066 per 
executed equivalent share, and, under the CAT Funding Model, each of 
the CEBB, CEBS and relevant Participant for a given transaction in an 
Eligible Security would be responsible for one-third of that rate, or 
$0.00001464571055623553 per executed equivalent share.\24\ In line with 
this approach, with respect to FINRA's portion of the Participants' 
one-third share, FINRA is proposing that, for Historical CAT Cost 
Recovery Assessment 1, the Participants' assessed fee rate would be 
split evenly between the CEBB and CEBS to establish a Historical CAT 
Cost Recovery Fee Rate 1 of $0.000007 per executed equivalent share 
\25\ for transactions where FINRA is the relevant Participant.\26\
---------------------------------------------------------------------------

    \23\ See Table 61, Section 6.1 (TRF/ORF/ADF Transaction Data 
Event) of the CAT Reporting Technical Specifications for Plan 
Participants.
    \24\ Dividing $0.0000439371316687066 by three equals 
$0.00001464571055623553.
    \25\ In approving the CAT Funding Model, the Commission 
concluded that ``the use of executed equivalent share volume as the 
basis of the proposed cost allocation methodology is reasonable and 
consistent with the approach taken by the funding principles of the 
CAT NMS Plan.'' See CAT Funding Model Approval Order, 88 FR 62628, 
62640. Under the CAT NMS Plan, executed equivalent shares in a 
transaction in Eligible Securities are reasonably counted as 
follows: (1) each executed share for a transaction in NMS Stocks 
will be counted as one executed equivalent share; (2) each executed 
contract for a transaction in Listed Options will be counted based 
on the multiplier applicable to the specific Listed Options (i.e., 
100 executed equivalent shares or such other applicable multiplier); 
and (3) each executed share for a transaction in OTC Equity 
Securities shall be counted as 0.01 executed equivalent share. See 
Section 11.3(a)(i)(B) and 11.3(b)(i)(B) of the CAT NMS Plan.
    \26\ Dividing $0.00001464571055623553 by two and rounding to six 
decimal places equals $0.000007. As with Historical CAT Assessment 
1, FINRA determined to use six decimal places for Historical CAT 
Cost Recovery Fee Rate 1 to balance the accuracy of the calculation 
with the potential systems and other impracticalities of using 
additional decimal places in the calculation.
---------------------------------------------------------------------------

    To implement Historical CAT Cost Recovery Assessment 1, FINRA 
proposes to adopt Rule 6897(b)(1)(A)(i) to provide that each member CAT 
Executing Broker shall receive its first invoice in April 2024, setting 
forth the Historical CAT Cost Recovery Assessment 1 fees calculated 
based on transactions in March 2024, and shall receive similar invoices 
for each month thereafter in which Historical CAT Cost Recovery 
Assessment 1 is in effect. As provided in proposed Rule 
6897(b)(1)(A)(ii), each monthly invoice shall set forth fees for each 
transaction in an Eligible Security executed by the CAT Executing 
Broker in its capacity as the CEBB and/or the CEBS (as applicable) 
otherwise than on an exchange as set forth in CAT Data. The Historical 
CAT Cost Recovery Assessment 1 fee assessed to each CEBB and CEBS for 
each such transaction will be calculated by multiplying the number of 
executed equivalent shares in the transaction by the Historical CAT 
Cost Recovery Fee Rate 1 of $0.000007 per executed equivalent share.
    Further, as provided in proposed Rule 6897(b)(1)(A)(iii), 
Historical CAT Cost Recovery Assessment 1 will remain in effect until 
FINRA's approximately $4.6 million contribution to the one-third share 
of Historical CAT Costs 1 assessed to the Plan Participants is 
collected from member CAT Executing Brokers collectively, which is 
estimated to be four months, but could be for a longer or shorter 
period of time.\27\ Proposed Rule 6897(b)(1)(A)(iv) confirms that each 
member CAT Executing broker shall be required to pay each invoice for 
Historical CAT Cost Recovery Assessment 1.
---------------------------------------------------------------------------

    \27\ From December 1, 2022 through November 30, 2023, the 
average monthly executed equivalent share volume in Eligible 
Securities where FINRA is the relevant SRO was approximately 100 
billion shares. Assuming similar 2024 trading volumes, FINRA would 
recover its approximately $4.6 million portion of the Participants' 
assessed share of Historical CAT Costs 1 within four months. Given 
the fee rate and total amount to be recovered, the proposed four-
month recovery period is both reasonable and unlikely to 
significantly overlap with any future CAT assessments under the CAT 
Funding Model or any future CAT cost recovery assessment passed 
through by FINRA, which would be the subject of a separate proposed 
rule change.
---------------------------------------------------------------------------

    Historical CAT Cost Recovery Assessment 1 will be assessed for all 
transactions in Eligible Securities executed otherwise than on an 
exchange in each month through the end of the month in which FINRA's 
approximately $4.6 million contribution to the Participants' one-third 
share of Historical CAT Costs 1 is assessed, and then FINRA will 
provide notice that Historical CAT Cost Recovery Assessment 1 is no 
longer in effect. As with Historical CAT Assessment 1, since Historical 
CAT Cost Recovery Assessment 1 is a monthly fee based on transaction 
volume from the prior month, Historical CAT Cost Recovery Assessment 1 
may result in the collection of more than FINRA's approximately $4.6 
million contribution to Historical CAT Costs 1. To the extent that 
occurs, any excess money collected during the final month in which 
Historical CAT Cost Recovery Assessment 1 is in effect will be used to 
offset future member fees assessed by FINRA to recover its 
contributions, as a Plan Participant, to CAT costs.\28\
---------------------------------------------------------------------------

    \28\ A similar approach will be taken by CAT LLC with respect to 
any excess money collected pursuant to Historical CAT Assessment 1 
during its final month. See File No. SR-FINRA-2024-002.
---------------------------------------------------------------------------

    FINRA also proposes to adopt Rule 6897(b)(2) to further describe 
the timing and manner of payment of Historical CAT Cost Recovery 
Assessment 1. The proposed provision requires member CAT Executing 
Brokers to pay Historical CAT Cost Recovery Assessment 1 on a monthly 
basis in the manner prescribed

[[Page 11157]]

by FINRA. In addition, each CAT Executing Broker would be required to 
pay the Historical CAT Cost Recovery Assessment 1 within 30 days after 
receipt of an invoice or other notice indicating payment is due (unless 
a longer payment period is otherwise indicated).
    FINRA also notes that, to assist Industry Members in complying with 
Historical CAT Assessment 1, each CAT Executing Broker will have access 
to mock invoices, made available by CAT LLC, with details for any fee 
liable transactions, including those executed otherwise than on an 
exchange for the months of November 2023, December 2023, January 2024 
and February 2024.\29\ Since Historical CAT Cost Recovery Assessment 1 
will allocate fees to each member CAT Executing Broker based on the 
same transactions used by CAT LLC to assess the off-exchange portion of 
Historical CAT Assessment 1 each month, member CAT Executing Brokers 
may also use the off-exchange transaction data provided by CAT LLC in 
the mock invoices to prepare for compliance with Historical CAT Cost 
Recovery Assessment 1. To further assist, beginning with the initial 
invoice in April 2024, FINRA also intends to make available to each 
member CAT Executing Broker a separate copy of the relevant details for 
fee liable transactions executed each month otherwise than on an 
exchange.
---------------------------------------------------------------------------

    \29\ See File No. SR-FINRA-2024-002.
---------------------------------------------------------------------------

    Furthermore, FINRA will also make publicly available on its 
website: (i) the total amount invoiced each month that Historical CAT 
Cost Recovery Assessment 1 is in effect, (ii) the total amount invoiced 
for Historical CAT Cost Recovery Assessment 1 for all months since its 
commencement, and (iii) the total costs remaining to be collected from 
members in aggregate for Historical CAT Cost Recovery Assessment 1. By 
reviewing statistics regarding how much has been invoiced and how much 
remains to be invoiced for Historical CAT Cost Recovery Assessment 1, 
members would have sufficient information to reasonably track how much 
longer Historical CAT Cost Recovery Assessment 1 is likely to be in 
place.
    FINRA has filed the proposed rule change for immediate 
effectiveness. The effective date and the implementation date will be 
the date of filing.
2. Statutory Basis
    FINRA believes that the proposed rule change is consistent with the 
provisions of Section 15A(b)(6) of the Act,\30\ which requires, among 
other things, that FINRA rules must be designed to prevent fraudulent 
and manipulative acts and practices, to promote just and equitable 
principles of trade, and, in general, to protect investors and the 
public interest; and must not be designed to permit unfair 
discrimination between customers, issuers, brokers or dealers. FINRA 
also believes that the proposed rule change is consistent with the 
provisions of Section 15A(b)(5) of the Act,\31\ which requires, among 
other things, that FINRA rules provide for the equitable allocation of 
reasonable dues, fees and other charges among members and issuers and 
other persons using any facility or system that FINRA operates or 
controls. FINRA further believes that the proposed rule change is 
consistent with Section 15A(b)(9) of the Act, which requires that FINRA 
rules not impose any burden on competition that is not necessary or 
appropriate in furtherance of the purpose of the Exchange Act.\32\ 
Section 15A(b)(2) of the Act also requires that FINRA be ``so organized 
and [have] the capacity to be able to carry out the purposes'' of the 
Act and ``to comply, and . . . to enforce compliance by its members, 
and persons associated with its members,'' with the provisions of the 
Exchange Act.\33\
---------------------------------------------------------------------------

    \30\ 15 U.S.C. 78o-3(b)(6).

    \33\ See 15 U.S.C. 78o-3(b)(2).
---------------------------------------------------------------------------

    FINRA believes that this proposed rule change is consistent with 
the Act because it is designed to assist FINRA in meeting regulatory 
obligations pursuant to the Plan. In approving the Plan, the SEC noted 
that the Plan ``is necessary and appropriate in the public interest, 
for the protection of investors and the maintenance of fair and orderly 
markets, to remove impediments to, and perfect the mechanism of a 
national market system, or is otherwise in furtherance of the purposes 
of the Act.'' \34\ To the extent that this proposed rule change 
implements a requirement that facilitates FINRA's achievement of its 
regulatory obligations under the Plan and applies specific requirements 
to FINRA members in this regard, FINRA believes that this proposed rule 
change furthers the objectives of the Plan, as identified by the SEC, 
and is therefore consistent with the Act.
---------------------------------------------------------------------------

    \34\ CAT NMS Plan Approval Order, 81 FR 84696, 84697.
---------------------------------------------------------------------------

    As discussed in detail in File No. SR-FINRA-2024-002, FINRA 
believes that the proposed fees paid by the CEBBs and CEBSs in 
connection with Historical CAT Assessment 1 are reasonable, equitably 
allocated and not unfairly discriminatory. Historical CAT Cost Recovery 
Assessment 1 would similarly allow FINRA to recover its costs from 
member CAT Executing Brokers in a fair and reasonable manner, as 
contemplated by the Exchange Act and consistent with the CAT Funding 
Model Approval Order.
    Proposed Historical CAT Cost Recovery Assessment 1 would be charged 
to member CAT Executing Brokers in support of the maintenance of a 
consolidated audit trail for regulatory purposes. The proposed fees, 
therefore, are consistent with the Commission's view that regulatory 
fees be used for regulatory purposes. The proposed fees would not cover 
FINRA services unrelated to the CAT, and any surplus would be used as a 
reserve to offset future member fees assessed by FINRA to recover its 
contributions, as a Plan Participant, to CAT costs. Accordingly, FINRA 
believes that the proposed fees are reasonable, equitable and not 
unfairly discriminatory.
    The reasonableness of Historical CAT Cost Recovery Assessment 1 and 
its consistency with the Exchange Act likewise is grounded in the facts 
described above and detailed in File No. SR-FINRA-2024-002. 
Specifically, the expenses that compose the portion of Past CAT Costs 
sought to be recovered through Historical CAT Cost Recovery Assessment 
1 were recognized by the SEC as appropriate for recovery pursuant to 
the formula approved in the CAT Funding Model (i.e., technology, legal, 
consulting, insurance, professional administration, and public 
relations costs). FINRA has determined that these costs, which are 
described in detail in File No. SR-FINRA-2024-002, are reasonable and 
it is appropriate that FINRA recover its Participant contribution to 
such costs through Historical CAT Cost Recovery Assessment 1. FINRA 
also has determined that Historical CAT Cost Recovery Assessment 1 
provides for the equitable allocation of fees among FINRA members and 
is not unfairly discriminatory, as discussed herein.
    Historical CAT Cost Recovery Assessment 1 is designed to allow 
FINRA to recover its designated portion of Historical CAT Costs 1, 
consistent with the Exchange Act and the CAT Funding Model Approval 
Order. In approving the CAT Funding Model, the Commission noted FINRA's 
request that it acknowledge ``FINRA's need and ability to cover CAT 
costs that are not recovered through contractual arrangements through 
member fee increases, so as not to jeopardize FINRA's ability to carry 
out its critical

[[Page 11158]]

regulatory mission.'' \35\ The Commission also recognized that ``the 
Exchange Act expressly contemplates the ability of the Participants to 
recoup their costs to fulfill their statutory obligations under the 
Exchange Act.'' \36\ The Commission further noted FINRA's statement 
``that it would file a rule change to increase its member fees with the 
filing of any proposed rule change to effectuate the Funding Model.'' 
\37\ The instant proposed rule change to adopt Historical CAT Cost 
Recovery Assessment 1 represents such a fee with respect to Historical 
CAT Costs 1.
---------------------------------------------------------------------------

    \35\ See CAT Funding Model Approval Order, 88 FR 62628, 62645.
    \36\ See supra note 35 at 62636-37.
    \37\ See supra note 35.
---------------------------------------------------------------------------

    Without a mechanism to recover its CAT costs, FINRA, a not-for-
profit, national securities association, would not be able to 
effectively sustain its regulatory mission. Thus, consistent with the 
cost allocation framework put in place by the SEC-approved CAT Funding 
Model, whereby CEBBs and CEBSs share equal responsibility for the costs 
assessed directly to Industry Members based on their transactions in 
Eligible Securities, FINRA is seeking to recoup these historical CAT 
costs in a like manner that is fair, reasonable, and equitably 
allocated among FINRA's member firms in their capacity as CAT Executing 
Brokers.
    Historical CAT Cost Recovery Assessment 1 will also allow FINRA to 
align its operating expenses with its operating revenues, target break-
even cash flows, and continue to responsibly manage expenses driven by 
mandatory initiatives, like the CAT NMS Plan, in a manner consistent 
with FINRA's public Financial Guiding Principles.\38\ FINRA 
periodically increases its regulatory fees to cover increased costs and 
scope of address of its member regulatory program; however, those fee 
increases are not designed to recover the separate costs associated 
with the development, maintenance, and operation of the CAT system 
under the CAT NMS Plan.\39\
---------------------------------------------------------------------------

    \38\ See FINRA's Financial Guiding Principles, <a href="https://www.finra.org/sites/default/files/finra_financial_guiding_principles_0.pdf">https://www.finra.org/sites/default/files/finra_financial_guiding_principles_0.pdf</a>.
    \39\ See Securities Exchange Act Release No. 90176 (October 14, 
2020), 85 FR 66592, 66602-03 (October 20, 2020) (Notice of Filing 
and Immediate Effectiveness of File No. SR-FINRA-2020-032). As FINRA 
explained: ``In addition to costs associated with its CAT reporting 
compliance program, FINRA must account for significant costs to 
integrate CAT data into its regulatory systems. . . . Importantly, 
these costs are separate from and in addition to FINRA's obligation 
to contribute funding for the development, maintenance, and 
operation of the CAT system incurred by the CAT Plan Processor.''
---------------------------------------------------------------------------

    FINRA's approach in determining Historical CAT Cost Recovery Fee 
Rate 1, which is consistent with the approach provided for under the 
SEC-approved Funding Model, is also reasonable and consistent with the 
Exchange Act. Specifically, similar to the CAT cost assessment 
methodology approved by the Commission, FINRA proposes to allocate 
equally among member CEBBs and CEBSs the portion of Participants' one-
third share of Historical CAT Costs 1 previously paid by FINRA.\40\ 
FINRA proposes to determine Historical CAT Cost Recovery Fee Rate 1 by 
multiplying the portion of Historical Fee Rate 1 assessed to the 
Participants under the CAT Funding Model, i.e., $0.00001464571055623553 
per executed equivalent share, by one-half such that member CEBBs and 
CEBSs would each be subject to an equal fee, i.e., $0.000007 per 
executed equivalent share, for each transaction in Eligible Securities 
executed otherwise than on an exchange. Therefore, each month that 
Historical CAT Cost Recovery Assessment 1 is in effect, member CEBBs 
and CEBSs will pay a fee to FINRA based on the same transactions used 
to determine fees payable by CEBBs and CEBSs to CAT LLC under 
Historical CAT Assessment 1 for off-exchange transactions. FINRA 
believes that this approach is reasonable in that, as is the case with 
the SEC-approved funding model, it apportions the assessed fee for 
members equally between the CAT Executing Brokers for the buyer and the 
seller.\41\
---------------------------------------------------------------------------

    \40\ In its approval of the CAT Funding Model, the Commission 
determined that charging CAT fees to CAT Executing Brokers was 
reasonable. In reaching this conclusion the Commission noted that 
the use of CAT Executing Brokers is appropriate because the CAT 
Funding Model is based upon the calculation of executed equivalent 
shares, and, therefore, charging CAT Executing Brokers would reflect 
their executing role in each transaction. Furthermore, the 
Commission noted that, because CAT Executing Brokers are already 
identified in transaction reports from FINRA's equity trade 
reporting facilities recorded in CAT Data, charging CAT Executing 
Brokers could streamline the billing process. See CAT Funding Model 
Approval Order, 88 FR 62628, 62629.
    \41\ See supra note 40.
---------------------------------------------------------------------------

    From December 1, 2022 through November 30, 2023, the average 
monthly executed equivalent share volume in Eligible Securities where 
FINRA is the relevant SRO was approximately 100 billion shares.\42\ 
Assuming similar 2024 trading volumes, under Historical CAT Cost 
Recovery Assessment 1, FINRA would recover its portion of the 
Participants' assessed share of Historical CAT Costs 1 within 
approximately four months. Given the relatively modest fee rate and 
amount to be recovered, the expected four-month recovery period is 
fair, reasonable, and equitable, and will allow FINRA to recover its 
costs in a relatively short timeframe without imposing significant 
additional financial or compliance burdens on members. Given the 
expected duration of four months, Historic CAT Cost Recovery Assessment 
1 is also unlikely to significantly overlap with any future CAT 
assessments under the CAT Funding Model or any future CAT cost recovery 
assessment passed through by FINRA (which would be subject to separate 
proposed rule changes with the Commission).
---------------------------------------------------------------------------

    \42\ See supra note 27.
---------------------------------------------------------------------------

B. Self-Regulatory Organization's Statement on Burden on Competition

    FINRA does not believe that the proposed rule change will result in 
any burden on competition that is not necessary or appropriate in 
furtherance of the purposes of the Act. Section 15A(b)(9) of the Act 
\43\ requires that FINRA's rules not impose any burden on competition 
that is not necessary or appropriate in furtherance of the purpose of 
the Exchange Act. FINRA notes that Historical CAT Cost Recovery 
Assessment 1 is designed to assist FINRA in meeting its regulatory 
obligations pursuant to the Plan.
---------------------------------------------------------------------------

    \43\ 15 U.S.C. 78o-3(b)(9).
---------------------------------------------------------------------------

    Furthermore, in approving the CAT Funding Model, the SEC analyzed 
the potential competitive impact of the CAT Funding Model, including 
competitive issues related to market services, trading services and 
regulatory services, efficiency concerns, and capital formation.\44\ 
The SEC also analyzed the potential effect of CAT fees calculated 
pursuant to the CAT Funding Model on affected categories of market 
participants, including Participants (including exchanges and FINRA), 
Industry Members (including subcategories of Industry Members, such as 
alternative trading systems, CAT Executing Brokers and market makers), 
and investors generally, and considered market effects related to 
equities and options, among other things.\45\ Based on this analysis, 
the SEC approved the CAT Funding Model as compliant with the Exchange 
Act. The Historical CAT Cost Recovery Assessment 1 fee framework is 
consistent with the fee framework of the CAT Funding Model, as approved 
by the SEC.
---------------------------------------------------------------------------

    \44\ See CAT Funding Model Approval Order, 88 FR 62628, 62678-
86.
    \45\ See supra note 44.
---------------------------------------------------------------------------

    As discussed in File No. SR-FINRA-2024-002, each of the inputs into 
the calculation of Historical CAT Assessment 1 is reasonable and the 
resulting fee rate for Historical CAT

[[Page 11159]]

Assessment 1 is reasonable. Therefore, Historical CAT Cost Recovery 
Assessment 1, for these same reasons, is reasonable and would not 
impose any burden on competition that is not necessary or appropriate 
in furtherance of the purpose of the Exchange Act.
Economic Impact Assessment
    Based on the regulatory need discussed above and summarized below, 
FINRA has undertaken an economic impact assessment, as set forth below, 
to analyze the potential economic impacts of the proposed rule change, 
including potential costs, benefits, and distributional and competitive 
effects, relative to the current baseline.
Regulatory Need
    On September 6, 2023, the Commission approved an amendment to the 
CAT NMS Plan that implements a revised funding model for CAT, the CAT 
Funding Model.\46\ This CAT Funding Model provides a framework for 
recovering past and future CAT costs, including a method for allocating 
these costs among Participants and Industry Members (with two-thirds of 
costs to be assessed directly on the industry and one-third to be 
assessed on the Participants).\47\
---------------------------------------------------------------------------

    \46\ See CAT Funding Model Approval Order.
    \47\ The CAT Funding Model establishes two categories of fees: 
(1) prospective fees (which includes fees for costs not previously 
paid by the SROs); and (2) past fees (which includes fees payable by 
industry members regarding CAT costs previously paid by the 
Participants). With respect to the industry portion, the Plan 
provides that each executing broker for the buyer and executing 
broker for the seller would be required to pay a fee for each 
transaction in an eligible security that is determined by 
multiplying the number of executed equivalent shares in the 
transaction by one-third, and by the fee rate established by the 
Operating Committee.
---------------------------------------------------------------------------

    The SEC's approval order for the CAT Funding Model also recognized 
that Participants may choose to pass-through their one-third portion of 
CAT Costs to their members. FINRA intends to recover from its members 
FINRA's portion of the Participants' share of Historical CAT Costs 1. 
As stated in FINRA's comment letters, as a not-for-profit national 
securities association that relies primarily on regulatory fees from 
members for funding, FINRA must increase member fees to fund CAT costs 
so as not to jeopardize FINRA's ability to meet its regulatory 
mission.\48\
---------------------------------------------------------------------------

    \48\ See supra note 14.
---------------------------------------------------------------------------

Economic Baseline
    Participants have paid Historical CAT Costs 1, incurred prior to 
January 1, 2022, in the amount of $337,688,610.\49\ Applying the SEC-
approved CAT Funding Model, Industry Members are responsible for two-
thirds of these costs, which amounts to $225,125,740, and one-third of 
these costs is allocated to Participants, which amounts to 
$112,562,870. FINRA's share of Historical CAT Costs 1 is $4,613,250 (or 
approximately 4.1% of the Participants' one-third portion of Historical 
CAT Costs 1).
---------------------------------------------------------------------------

    \49\ As discussed above, Historical CAT Costs 1 include 
technology (cloud hosting services and operating, CAIS operating, 
and change request fees), legal, consulting, insurance, professional 
and administration, and public relations costs.
---------------------------------------------------------------------------

    The Operating Committee determined the Historical Fee Rate to be 
used in calculating Historical CAT Assessment 1 by dividing Historical 
CAT Costs 1 ($337,688,610) by the projected total executed share volume 
of all transactions in Eligible Securities over 24 months 
(7,685,722,694,558.88 shares). Based on this calculation, the Operating 
Committee determined that Historical Fee Rate 1 would be 
$0.0000439371316687066 per executed equivalent share. Under the CAT 
Funding Model, each CEBB, CEBS and relevant Participant for a given 
transaction in an Eligible Security is responsible for one-third of 
that rate, or $0.00001464571055623553 per executed equivalent share.
    To recover FINRA's contribution to the Participants' one-third 
share of Historical CAT Costs 1, consistent with the approach taken in 
the CAT Funding Model, FINRA is proposing to equally apportion the fee 
rate between the member firm CEBB and CEBS for each relevant 
transaction, such that each would pay $0.000007 (i.e., 0.5 x 
$0.00001464571055623553) per executed equivalent share, for each 
transaction in Eligible Securities executed otherwise than on an 
exchange.
    Historical CAT Cost Recovery Assessment 1 will remain in effect 
through the month in which FINRA recovers from FINRA member CEBBs and 
CEBSs collectively its contribution to the one-third share of 
Historical CAT Costs 1. For the purposes of estimating the recovery 
period for the Historical CAT Cost Recovery Assessment 1, FINRA 
computed an executed equivalent share volume for OTC transactions in 
NMS stocks and OTC equity securities for the twelve months from 
December 1, 2022 through November 30, 2023. Assuming similar 2024 
trading volume, given an estimated executed equivalent share volume of 
1,220,781,467,645 shares \50\ and a fee rate of $0.000007 per executed 
equivalent share for each CEBB and CEBS, FINRA estimates that it would 
recover its one-third share of Historical CAT Costs 1 in four months. 
The actual recovery period could be a longer or shorter period of time 
depending on actual trade volume.
---------------------------------------------------------------------------

    \50\ For the twelve months from December 1, 2022 through 
November 30,2023, 1,208,689,888,387 shares of NMS stocks were 
reported to the TRF, and 1,209,157,925,786 shares of OTC Equity 
Securities were reported to ORF. Given that each executed share for 
a transaction in an OTC Equity Security is counted as 0.01 
equivalent share, FINRA estimates that the executed equivalent share 
volume for NMS stocks and OTC Equity Securities reported to any 
FINRA trade reporting facility in that one-year period is 
1,220,781,467,645 shares.
---------------------------------------------------------------------------

    For the twelve months from December 1, 2022 through November 30, 
2023, based on transactions reported to a FINRA TRF or to the ORF, 
there were 883 firm MPIDs that executed at least one purchase or sale 
of an equivalent share of an Eligible Security. The top 50 MPIDs by 
reported executed equivalent share volume bought and/or sold 
2,077,385,279,612 equivalent shares, or 85.08% of total shares bought 
and/or sold.
Potential Economic Benefits, Costs and Competitive Impact
    FINRA's proposal to recover its portion of the Participants' one-
third share of Historical CAT Costs applies an approach consistent with 
the CAT Funding Model as approved by the SEC.\51\ With regard to off-
exchange transactions in Eligible Securities, generally the same 
members that will be assessed Historical CAT Cost Recovery Assessment 1 
will also be assessed Historical CAT Assessment 1. Therefore, FINRA's 
proposed approach in recovering its portion of Historical CAT Costs 1, 
which is consistent with the framework of the CAT Funding Model, should 
serve to mitigate costs for member firms with respect to the structure 
of the fee model, whereas a different proposed fee structure may 
involve additional costs or complexity.
---------------------------------------------------------------------------

    \51\ See CAT Funding Model Approval Order.
---------------------------------------------------------------------------

    The recovery period for FINRA's portion of the one-third share of 
Historical CAT Costs 1 is expected to be four months, which is shorter 
than the Historical Recovery Period for the two-thirds portion of 
Historical CAT Costs 1 assessed to Industry Members.\52\ Given the 
expected duration, Historic CAT Cost Recovery Assessment 1 is unlikely 
to overlap with any future CAT assessments under the CAT Funding Model 
or any future CAT cost recovery assessment passed through by FINRA, 
which would be subject to separate proposed rule changes with the 
Commission.
---------------------------------------------------------------------------

    \52\ See File No. SR-FINRA-2024-002.

---------------------------------------------------------------------------

[[Page 11160]]

    Where CEBB and CEBS choose to pass Historical CAT Cost Recovery 
Assessment 1 on to customers, some customers could attempt to avoid 
incurring this temporary cost by delaying trades until after the 
FINRA's contribution to the Participants' one-third share of Historical 
CAT Costs 1 is paid. FINRA believes this is an unlikely event because 
this fee is only one part of a trader's decision to not trade and 
potentially miss a trading opportunity. In addition, as the Historical 
CAT Cost Recovery Assessment 1 recovery period is dependent on the 
level of trading activity, delaying trading may only serve to lengthen 
the recovery period. However, traders that do trade during the recovery 
period may incur relatively more fees than those that trade after the 
recovery period has ended.
    As the SEC noted in approving the revised CAT Funding Model, if 
FINRA passes on its portion of the CAT fee allocation to its member 
firms and exchanges choose not to pass-through their CAT fee 
allocations to their members, the cost to transact off exchange may 
increase relative to executing on an exchange, potentially giving 
exchanges a competitive advantage.\53\ However, we do not know whether 
or to what extent (or how) the exchanges may seek to recover their 
portion of the Historical CAT Costs, and we do not know whether or to 
what extent member firms will choose to pass through exchange-incurred 
CAT fees to customers. We also note that FINRA members remain subject 
to regulatory obligations, such as best execution obligations, with 
respect to their order routing decisions.

C. Self-Regulatory Organization's Statement on Comments on the Proposed 
Rule Change Received From Members, Participants, or Others
    Written comments were neither solicited nor received.

III. Suspension of the Proposed Rule Change

    Pursuant to Section 19(b)(3)(C) of the Act,\54\ at any time within 
60 days of the date of filing of a proposed rule change pursuant to 
Section 19(b)(1) of the Act,\55\ the Commission summarily may 
temporarily suspend the change in the rules of an SRO if it appears to 
the Commission that such action is necessary or appropriate in the 
public interest, for the protection of investors, or otherwise in 
furtherance of the purposes of the Act. As discussed below, a temporary 
suspension of the proposed rule change is necessary or appropriate to 
allow for additional analysis of the proposed rule change's consistency 
with the Act and the rules thereunder.
---------------------------------------------------------------------------

    \54\ 15 U.S.C. 78s(b)(3)(C).
    \55\ 15 U.S.C. 78s(b)(1).
---------------------------------------------------------------------------

    When SROs file their proposed rule changes with the Commission, 
including fee filings like FINRA's present proposed rule change, they 
are required to provide a statement supporting the proposed rule 
change's basis under the Act and the rules and regulations thereunder 
applicable to the SRO.\56\ The instructions to Form 19b-4, on which 
SROs file their proposed rule changes, specify that such statement 
``should be sufficiently detailed and specific to support a finding 
that the proposed rule change is consistent with [those] 
requirements.'' \57\
---------------------------------------------------------------------------

    \56\ See 17 CFR 240.19b-4 (Item 3 entitled ``Self-Regulatory 
Organization's Statement of the Purpose of, and Statutory Basis for, 
the Proposed Rule Change'').
    \57\ See id.
---------------------------------------------------------------------------

    Among other things, FINRA's proposed rule change is subject to 
Section 15A of the Act, including Sections 15A(b)(5), (6), and (9), 
which require the rules of a national securities association 
(``association'') to: (1) provide for the equitable allocation of 
reasonable dues, fees and other charges among members and issuers and 
other persons using any facility or system which the association 
operates or controls; \58\ (2) be designed to prevent fraudulent and 
manipulative acts and practices, to promote just and equitable 
principles of trade, to foster cooperation and coordination with 
persons engaged in regulating, clearing, settling, processing 
information with respect to, and facilitating transactions in 
securities, to remove impediments to and perfect the mechanism of a 
free and open market and a national market system, and, in general, to 
protect investors and the public interest, and not be designed to 
permit unfair discrimination between customers, issuers, brokers, or 
dealers; \59\ and (3) not impose any burden on competition not 
necessary or appropriate in furtherance of the purposes of the Act.\60\ 
Further, FINRA also is subject to Section 15A(b)(2) of the Act, which 
requires that FINRA be ``so organized and [have] the capacity to be 
able to carry out the purposes'' of the Act and ``to comply, and . . . 
to enforce compliance by its members and persons associated with its 
members,'' with the provisions of the Act.\61\
---------------------------------------------------------------------------

    \58\ See 15 U.S.C. 78o-3(b)(5).
    \59\ See 15 U.S.C. 78o-3(b)(6).
    \60\ See 15 U.S.C. 78o-3(b)(9).
    \61\ See 15 U.S.C. 78o-3(b)(2).
---------------------------------------------------------------------------

    In temporarily suspending FINRA's fee change, the Commission 
intends to further consider whether the proposed fees are consistent 
with the statutory requirements applicable to a national securities 
association under the Act. Among other things, the Commission will 
consider whether the proposed rule change provides for reasonable fees 
that satisfy the standards under the Act and the rules thereunder.\62\
---------------------------------------------------------------------------

    \62\ See 15 U.S.C. 78o-3(b)(5).
---------------------------------------------------------------------------

    Therefore, the Commission finds that it is necessary or appropriate 
in the public interest, for the protection of investors, and otherwise 
in furtherance of the purposes of the Act, to temporarily suspend the 
proposed rule change.\63\
---------------------------------------------------------------------------

    \63\ For purposes of temporarily suspending the proposed rule 
change, the Commission has considered the proposed rule's impact on 
efficiency, competition, and capital formation. See 15 U.S.C. 
78c(f).
---------------------------------------------------------------------------

IV. Proceedings To Determine Whether To Approve or Disapprove the 
Proposed Rule Change

    In addition to temporarily suspending the proposed rule change, the 
Commission is instituting proceedings pursuant to Sections 19(b)(3)(C) 
\64\ and 19(b)(2)(B) \65\ of the Act to determine whether the proposed 
rule change should be approved or disapproved. Institution of 
proceedings does not indicate that the Commission has reached any 
conclusions with respect to any of the issues involved. Rather, as 
described below, the Commission seeks and encourages interested persons 
to provide comments on the proposed rule change to inform the 
Commission's analysis of whether to approve or disapprove the proposed 
rule change.
---------------------------------------------------------------------------

    \64\ 15 U.S.C. 78s(b)(3)(C). Once the Commission temporarily 
suspends a proposed rule change, Section 19(b)(3)(C) of the Act 
requires that the Commission institute proceedings under Section 
19(b)(2)(B) to determine whether a proposed rule change should be 
approved or disapproved.
    \65\ 15 U.S.C. 78s(b)(2)(B).
---------------------------------------------------------------------------

    Pursuant to Section 19(b)(2)(B) of the Act,\66\ the Commission is 
providing notice of the grounds for possible disapproval under 
consideration. The Commission is instituting proceedings to allow for 
additional consideration and comment on whether FINRA has

[[Page 11161]]

sufficiently demonstrated that the proposed rule change is consistent 
with Section 15A(b)(5) \67\ of the Act, which, among other things, 
provides that the dues, fees, and other charges for an association's 
members be reasonable.
---------------------------------------------------------------------------

    \66\ 15 U.S.C. 78s(b)(2)(B). Section 19(b)(2)(B) of the Act also 
provides that proceedings to determine whether to disapprove a 
proposed rule change must be concluded within 180 days of the date 
of publication of notice of the filing of the proposed rule change. 
See id. The time for conclusion of the proceedings may be extended 
for up to 60 days if the Commission finds good cause for such 
extension and publishes its reasons for so finding, or if the SRO 
consents to the longer period. See id.
    \67\ 15 U.S.C. 78o-3(b)(5).
---------------------------------------------------------------------------

V. Commission's Solicitation of Comments

    The Commission requests that interested persons provide written 
submission of their views, data, and arguments with respect to the 
issues identified above, as well as any other concerns they have with 
the proposed rule change. In particular, the Commission invites the 
written views of interested persons concerning whether the proposed 
rule change is consistent with Section 15A(b)(5), or any other 
provision of the Act, or the rules and regulations thereunder. Although 
there do not appear to be any issues relevant to approval or 
disapproval that would be facilitated by an oral presentation of views, 
data, and arguments, the Commission will consider, pursuant to Rule 
19b-4, any request for an opportunity to make an oral presentation.\68\
---------------------------------------------------------------------------

    \68\ 15 U.S.C. 78s(b)(2). Section 19(b)(2) of the Act grants the 
Commission flexibility to determine what type of proceeding--either 
oral or notice and opportunity for written comments--is appropriate 
for consideration of a particular proposed rule change by an SRO. 
See Securities Acts Amendments of 1975, Report of the Senate 
Committee on Banking, Housing and Urban Affairs to Accompany S. 249, 
S. Rep. No. 75, 94th Cong., 1st Sess. 30 (1975).
---------------------------------------------------------------------------

    Interested persons are invited to submit written data, views, and 
arguments regarding whether the proposed rule changes should be 
approved or disapproved by March 5, 2024. Any person who wishes to file 
a rebuttal to any other person's submission must file that rebuttal by
