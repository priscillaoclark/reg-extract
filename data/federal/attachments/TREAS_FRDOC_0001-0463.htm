SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION:

Background

    The Convention on Cultural Property Implementation Act (Pub. L. 97-
446, 19 U.S.C. 2601 et seq.) (CPIA), which implements the 1970 United 
Nations Educational, Scientific and Cultural Organization (UNESCO) 
Convention on the Means of Prohibiting and Preventing the Illicit 
Import, Export and Transfer of Ownership of Cultural Property (823 
U.N.T.S. 231 (1972)) (Convention), allows for the conclusion of an 
agreement between the United States and another party to the Convention 
to impose import restrictions on certain archaeological and 
ethnological material. Pursuant to the CPIA, the United States entered 
into a bilateral agreement with the Republic of Tunisia (Tunisia) to 
impose import restrictions on certain archaeological and ethnological 
material of Tunisia. This rule announces that the United States is now 
imposing import restrictions on certain archaeological and ethnological 
material of Tunisia through February 6, 2029. This period may be 
extended for additional periods, each extension not to exceed five 
years, if it is determined that the factors justifying the initial 
agreement still pertain and no cause for suspension of the agreement 
exists (19 U.S.C. 2602(e); Sec.  12.104g(a) of title 19 of the Code of 
Federal Regulations (19 CFR 12.104g(a))).

Determinations

    Under 19 U.S.C. 2602(a)(1), the United States must make certain 
determinations before entering into an agreement to impose import 
restrictions under 19 U.S.C. 2602(a)(2). On September 23, 2020, the 
Assistant Secretary for Educational and Cultural Affairs, United States 
Department of State, after consultation with and recommendation by the 
Cultural Property Advisory Committee, made the determinations required 
under the statute with respect to certain archaeological and 
ethnological material originating in Tunisia that is described in the 
Designated List set forth below in this document.
    These determinations include the following: (1) that the cultural 
patrimony of Tunisia is in jeopardy from the pillage of archaeological 
material representing Tunisia's cultural heritage dating from 
approximately 200,000 B.C. to A.D. 1750, and ethnological material 
representing Tunisia's cultural heritage from the Ottoman and early 
Husseinite periods, ranging in date from approximately A.D. 1574 to 
1881 (19 U.S.C. 2602(a)(1)(A)); (2) that the Tunisian government has 
taken measures consistent with the Convention to protect its cultural 
patrimony (19 U.S.C. 2602(a)(1)(B)); (3) that import restrictions 
imposed by the United States would be of substantial benefit in 
deterring a serious situation of pillage and remedies less drastic are 
not available (19 U.S.C. 2602(a)(1)(C)); and (4) that the application 
of import restrictions as set forth in this final rule is consistent 
with the general interests of the international community in the 
interchange of cultural property among nations for scientific, 
cultural, and educational purposes (19 U.S.C. 2602(a)(1)(D)). The 
Assistant Secretary also found that the material described in the 
determinations meets the statutory definition of ``archaeological or 
ethnological material of the State Party'' (19 U.S.C. 2601(2)).

The Agreement

    On March 16, 2023, the Governments of the United States and Tunisia 
signed a bilateral agreement, ``Memorandum of Understanding between the 
Government of the United States of America and the Government of the 
Republic of Tunisia Concerning the Imposition of Import Restrictions on 
Archaeological and Ethnological Material of Tunisia'' (the

[[Page 58979]]

Agreement), pursuant to the provisions of 19 U.S.C. 2602(a)(2). The 
Agreement entered into force on February 6, 2024, following the 
exchange of diplomatic notes, and enables the promulgation of import 
restrictions on certain categories of archaeological material ranging 
in date from approximately 200,000 B.C. to A.D. 1750, as well as 
certain categories of ethnological material from the Ottoman and early 
Husseinite periods, ranging in date from approximately A.D. 1574 to 
1881. A list of the categories of archaeological and ethnological 
material subject to the import restrictions is set forth later in this 
document.

Restrictions and Amendment to the Regulations

    In accordance with the Agreement, importation of material 
designated below is subject to the restrictions of 19 U.S.C. 2606 and 
19 CFR 12.104g(a) and will be restricted from entry into the United 
States unless the conditions set forth in 19 U.S.C. 2606 and 19 CFR 
12.104c are met. CBP is amending 19 CFR 12.104g(a) to indicate that 
these import restrictions have been imposed.
    Import restrictions listed at 19 CFR 12.104g(a) are effective for 
no more than five years beginning on the date on which an agreement 
enters into force with respect to the United States. This period may be 
extended for additional periods of not more than five years if it is 
determined that the factors which justified the agreement still pertain 
and no cause for suspension of the agreement exists. Therefore, the 
import restrictions will expire on February 6, 2029, unless extended.

Designated List of Archaeological and Ethnological Material of Tunisia

    The Agreement between the United States and Tunisia includes, but 
is not limited to, the categories of objects described in the 
Designated List set forth below. Importation of material on this list 
is restricted unless the material is accompanied by documentation 
certifying that the material left Tunisia legally and not in violation 
of the export laws of Tunisia.
    The Designated List includes archaeological and ethnological 
material from Tunisia. The archaeological material in the Designated 
List includes, but is not limited to, objects made of stone, ceramic, 
metal, bone, ivory, shell and other organic materials, glass, faience, 
semi-precious stone, painting, plaster, wood, and textiles ranging in 
date from approximately 200,000 B.C. to A.D. 1750. The ethnological 
material in the Designated List includes, but is not limited to, 
architectural elements, manuscripts, and ceremonial, ritual, and 
funerary objects of the Islamic culture from the Ottoman and early 
Husseinite periods, ranging in date from approximately A.D. 1574 to 
1881. This would exclude Jewish ceremonial or ritual objects. The 
Designated List is representative only. Any dates and dimensions are 
approximate.

Inapplicability of Notice and Delayed Effective Date

    This amendment involves a foreign affairs function of the United 
States and is, therefore, being made without notice or public procedure 
(5 U.S.C. 553(a)(1)). For the same reason, a delayed effective date is 
not required under 5 U.S.C. 553(d)(3).

Executive Orders 12866 and 13563

    Executive Orders 12866 (Regulatory Planning and Review), as amended 
by Executive Order 14094 (Modernizing Regulatory Review), and 13563 
(Improving Regulation and Regulatory Review) direct agencies to assess 
the costs and benefits of available regulatory alternatives and, if 
regulation is necessary, to select regulatory approaches that maximize 
net benefits (including potential economic, environmental, public 
health and safety effects, distributive impacts, and equity). Executive 
Order 13563 emphasizes the importance of quantifying costs and 
benefits, reducing costs, harmonizing rules, and promoting flexibility. 
CBP has determined that this document is not a regulation or rule 
subject to the provisions of Executive Orders 12866 and 13563 because 
it pertains to a foreign affairs function of the United States, as 
described above, and therefore is specifically exempted by section 
3(d)(2) of Executive Order 12866 and, by extension, Executive Order 
13563.

Regulatory Flexibility Act

    The Regulatory Flexibility Act (5 U.S.C. 601 et seq.), as amended 
by the Small Business Regulatory Enforcement Fairness Act of 1996, 
requires an agency to prepare and make available to the public a 
regulatory flexibility analysis that describes the effect of a proposed 
rule on small entities (i.e., small businesses, small organizations, 
and small governmental jurisdictions) when the agency is required to 
publish a general notice of proposed rulemaking for a rule. Since a 
general notice of proposed rulemaking is not necessary for this rule, 
CBP is not required to prepare a regulatory flexibility analysis for 
this rule.
