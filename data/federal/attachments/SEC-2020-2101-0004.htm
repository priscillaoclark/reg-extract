SECURITIES AND EXCHANGE COMMISSION

[SEC File No. 270-361, OMB Control No. 3235-0411]


Submission for OMB Review; Comment Request; Extension: Rule 489 
and Form F-N

Upon Written Request, Copies Available From: Securities and Exchange 
Commission, Office of FOIA Services, 100 F Street NE, Washington, DC 
20549-2736

    Notice is hereby given that, pursuant to the Paperwork Reduction 
Act of 1995 (44 U.S.C. 3501 et seq.) (``Paperwork Reduction Act''), the 
Securities and Exchange Commission (the ``Commission'') has submitted 
to the Office of Management and Budget (``OMB'') a request for 
extension of the

previously approved collection of information discussed below.
    Rule 489 (17 CFR 230.489) under the Securities Act of 1933 (15 
U.S.C. 77a et seq.) requires foreign banks and foreign insurance 
companies and holding companies and finance subsidiaries of foreign 
banks and foreign insurance companies that are exempted from the 
definition of ``investment company'' by virtue of rules 3a-1 (17 CFR 
270.3a-1), 3a-5 (17 CFR 270.3a-5), and 3a-6 (17 CFR 270.3a-6) under the 
Investment Company Act of 1940 (15 U.S.C. 80a-1 et seq.) to file Form 
F-N (17 CFR 239.43) to appoint an agent for service of process when 
making a public offering of securities in the United States. The 
information is collected so that the Commission and private plaintiffs 
may serve process on foreign entities in actions and administrative 
proceedings arising out of or based on the offer or sales of securities 
in the United States by such foreign entities.
    The Commission received an average of 25 Form F-N filings per year 
over the last three years (2020-2022). The Commission has previously 
estimated that the total annual burden associated with information 
collection and Form F-N preparation and submission is one hour per 
filing. Based on the Commission's experience with disclosure documents 
generally, the Commission continues to believe that this estimate is 
appropriate. Thus the estimated total annual burden for rule 489 and 
Form F-N is 25 hours.
    Estimates of the average burden hours are made solely for the 
purposes of the Paperwork Reduction Act and are not derived from a 
comprehensive or even a representative survey or study of the costs of 
Commission rules and forms. Compliance with the collection of 
information requirements of rule 489 and Form F-N is mandatory to 
obtain the benefit of the exemption. Responses to the collection of 
information will not be kept confidential. An agency may not conduct or 
sponsor, and a person is not required to respond to, a collection of 
information unless it displays a currently valid OMB control number.
    The public may view background documentation for this information 
collection at the following website: <a href="http://www.reginfo.gov">www.reginfo.gov</a>. Find this 
particular information collection by selecting ``Currently under 30-day 
Review--Open for Public Comments'' or by using the search function. 
Written comments and recommendations for the proposed information 
collection should be sent within 30 days of publication of this notice 
by January 22, 2024 to (i) <a href="/cdn-cgi/l/email-protection#89c4cbd1a7c6c4cba7c6c0dbc8a7dacccad6edecfae2d6e6efefe0eaecfbc9e6e4eba7ece6f9a7eee6ff"><span class="__cf_email__" data-cfemail="165b544e38595b5438595f445738455355497273657d497970707f75736456797b743873796638717960">[email&#160;protected]</span></a>
