EXPORT-IMPORT BANK

[Public Notice: 2021-6003]


Agency Information Collection Activities: Comment Request

AGENCY: Export-Import Bank of the United States.

ACTION: Submission for OMB review and comments request.

-----------------------------------------------------------------------

SUMMARY: The Export-Import Bank of the United States (EXIM), as a part 
of its continuing effort to reduce paperwork and respondent burden, 
invites the general public and other Federal Agencies to comment on the 
proposed information collection, as required by the Paperwork Reduction 
Act of 1995. The collection provides EXIM staff with the information 
necessary to monitor the borrower's payments for exported goods covered 
under its short and medium-term export credit insurance policies. It 
also alerts EXIM staff of defaults, so they can manage the portfolio in 
an informed manner.

DATES: Comments must be received on or before April 9, 2021 to be 
assured of consideration.

ADDRESSES: Comments may be submitted electronically on 
WWW.REGULATIONS.GOV or by mail to Mia Johnson, Export-Import Bank of 
the United States, 811 Vermont Ave. NW Washington, DC 20571. Form can 
be viewed at <a href="https://www.exim.gov/sites/default/files/forms/eib10-05.pdf">https://www.exim.gov/sites/default/files/forms/eib10-05.pdf</a>.

SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION:
    Title and Form Number: EIB 92-29 Export-Import Bank Report of 
Premiums Payable for Exporters Only.
    OMB Number: 3048-0017.
    Type of Review: Regular.
    Need and Use: The ``Report of Premiums Payable for Exporters Only'' 
form is used by exporters to report and pay premiums on insured 
shipments to various foreign buyers under the terms of the policy and 
to certify that premiums have been correctly computed and remitted. 
Individual transactions that an exporter may have with the same foreign 
borrower can be sub-totaled and entered as a single line item for the 
specific month provided the length of payment term is identical. The 
use of sub-totals reduces the administrative burden on the exporter. 
The `Report of Premiums Payable for Exporters Only' is used by the Bank 
to determine the eligibility of the shipment(s) and to calculate the 
premium due to Ex-Im Bank for its support of the shipment(s) under its 
insurance program.
    Affected Public: This form affects entities involved in the export 
of U.S. goods and services.
    Annual Number of Respondents: 2600.
    Estimated Time per Respondent: 15 minutes.
    Annual Burden Hours: 650 hours.
    Frequency of Reporting or Use: Monthly.
    Government Expenses:
    Reviewing Time per Year: 1,950 hours.
    Average Wages per Hour: $42.50.
    Average Cost per Year: $82,875.
