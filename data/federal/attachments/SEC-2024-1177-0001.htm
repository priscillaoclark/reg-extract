I. Clearing Agency's Statement of the Terms of Substance of the 
Proposed Rule Change

    The proposed rule change consists of modifications to the DTC 
Operational Arrangements (Necessary for Securities to Become and Remain 
Eligible for DTC Services) (``OA'') \5\ to provide for a modernized 
process for submission of notices (``LENS Notices'') by issuers, 
transfer agents and trustees to DTC's Legal Notice System (``LENS'') 
and DTC's processing of such LENS Notices.\6\ Specifically, the 
proposal would revise the OA to replace existing methods for submitting 
LENS Notices with an online portal (``Issuer Agent Portal'') that DTC 
has developed for this purpose. The proposed rule change would also 
make technical and clarifying changes to the text of the OA relating to 
the submission and processing of LENS Notices, as described in greater 
detail below.\7\

---------------------------------------------------------------------------

II. Clearing Agency's Statement of the Purpose of, and Statutory Basis 
for, the Proposed Rule Change

    In its filing with the Commission, the clearing agency included 
statements concerning the purpose of and basis for the proposed rule 
change and discussed any comments it received on the proposed rule 
change. The text of these statements may be examined at the places 
specified in Item IV below. The clearing agency has prepared summaries, 
set forth in sections A, B,

[[Page 70231]]

and C below, of the most significant aspects of such statements.

(A) Clearing Agency's Statement of the Purpose of, and Statutory Basis 
for, the Proposed Rule Change

1. Purpose
    The proposed rule change consists of modifications to the OA to 
provide for a modernized process for submission of LENS Notices by 
issuers, transfer agents and trustees to DTC's Legal Notice System 
(``LENS'') and DTC's processing of such LENS Notices. Specifically, the 
proposal would revise the OA to replace existing methods for submitting 
LENS Notices with an online portal (``Issuer Agent Portal'') that DTC 
has developed for this purpose. The proposed rule change would also 
make technical and clarifying changes to the text of the OA relating to 
the submission and processing of LENS Notices, as described below.
Background
    A LENS Notice is a notice of information, provided to DTC by an 
issuer, transfer agent or trustee of securities, which is intended to 
be made available to holders of securities. Parties submitting LENS 
Notices may have a legal or regulatory obligation or other interest in 
distributing the notice information to holders of the securities. Such 
notices are delivered to DTC because DTC's nominee, Cede & Co., is the 
registered holder of the applicable securities and/or DTC is the 
``appropriate qualified registered securities depository'' \8\ with 
respect to the securities.
---------------------------------------------------------------------------

    \8\ Pursuant to Rule 17Ad-16 (``Rule 17Ad-16'') under the Act, 
an ``appropriate qualified registered securities depository'' shall 
mean the qualified registered securities depository that the 
Commission so designates by order or, in the absence of such 
designation, the qualified registered securities depository that is 
the largest holder of record of all qualified registered securities 
depositories as of the most recent record date. 17 CFR 240.17Ad-
16(f).
---------------------------------------------------------------------------

    A type of LENS Notice DTC receives is a notice of transfer agent 
changes (``17Ad-16 Notice'') pursuant to Rule 17Ad-16.\9\ DTC has been 
designated by the Commission as the appropriate qualified registered 
securities depository to receive 17Ad-16 Notices.\10\ Rule 17Ad-16 is 
designed to address transfer delays due to unannounced transfer agent 
changes, including the termination or assumption of the transfer agent 
services for a particular issue, and the change of the name or address 
of a transfer agent.\11\ Rule 17Ad-16 requires a registered transfer 
agent to send a 17Ad-16 Notice to the appropriate qualified registered 
securities depository (a) on or before the later of ten calendar days 
prior to the effective date of such termination or the day the transfer 
agent is notified of the effective date of such termination \12\ and 
(b) on or before the later of ten calendar days prior to the effective 
date of a change in the registered transfer agent's name or address or 
when that registered transfer agent assumes transfer agent services on 
behalf of an issuer of securities.\13\
---------------------------------------------------------------------------

    \9\ Id.
    \10\ See Securities Exchange Act Release No. 35378 (Feb. 15, 
1995), 60 FR 9875 (Feb. 22, 1995) (File No. SR-DTC-95-02).
    \11\ See Securities Exchange Act Release No. 35039 (Dec. 1, 
1994), 59 FR 63656 (Dec. 8, 1994) (S7-1-92).
    \12\ 17 CFR 240.17Ad-16(a).
    \13\ 17 CFR 240.17Ad-16(b).
---------------------------------------------------------------------------

    Any transfer agent for securities held at DTC, whether or not it is 
a registered transfer agent, and any trustee for securities held at DTC 
must submit information relating to transfer agent or trustee changes 
to DTC. Today, these LENS Notices must be provided via (i) designated 
email addresses (``Email Method'') or (ii) an online link (``Link 
Method,'' and collectively with the Email Method, the ``Current 
Submission Methods''), as set forth in the OA.\14\
---------------------------------------------------------------------------

    \14\ See OA, supra note 5, at 27-29.
---------------------------------------------------------------------------

    Issuers, transfer agents and trustees may deliver other types of 
LENS Notices to holders to DTC for posting to LENS. These include, but 
are not limited to, closing memoranda, new issue memoranda, mutual fund 
memoranda, notices for ineligible securities, legal notices, tax 
notices and other forms of public investor communications.\15\ Such 
LENS Notices must be submitted via the Email Method.
---------------------------------------------------------------------------

    \15\ See OA, supra note 5, at 29.
---------------------------------------------------------------------------

    If a LENS Notice is delivered to DTC using the applicable Current 
Submission Method, DTC then posts the LENS Notice to LENS, where it 
becomes available for viewing by Participants.\16\ DTC makes each 17Ad-
16 Notice available to Participants within 24 hours of DTC's receipt of 
the notice from the transfer agent, not including weekends and holidays 
(i.e., non-Business Days).\17\
---------------------------------------------------------------------------

    \16\ Once a LENS Notice is posted, a Participant may share it 
with its customers.
    \17\ For example, if DTC receives a 17Ad-16 Notice through a 
Current Submission Method at 6:00 p.m. Eastern Time (``ET'') on a 
Monday (that is not a holiday), DTC makes the 17Ad-16 Notice 
available for viewing by Participants on LENS no later than 5:59 
p.m. ET on Tuesday. For weekends, if DTC receives a notice at or 
after 6:00 p.m. ET on a Friday, DTC makes the 17Ad-16 Notice 
available for viewing by Participants on LENS no later than 5:59 
p.m. ET on Monday.
---------------------------------------------------------------------------

Proposed Enhancements
    The Current Submission Methods require manual intervention by DTC 
to post the LENS Notices that it receives to LENS. DTC proposes to 
automate these processes through implementation of the Issuer Agent 
Portal, which would provide a more efficient straight-through posting 
of LENS Notices, in support of the regulatory required timeframes. In 
this regard, the Issuer Agent Portal would allow centralized receipt 
and dissemination of LENS Notices and eliminate the manual processing 
that DTC currently performs to post LENS Notices.
    More specifically, the proposal will update the OA to establish the 
Issuer Agent Portal for (i) receiving LENS Notices, and (ii) automated 
posting of LENS Notices to LENS. The Current Submission Methods would 
be discontinued. The proposed rule change will also make technical and 
clarifying changes relating to the submission and posting of LENS 
Notices, as described below.
Proposed Rule Change
    Pursuant to the proposed rule change, the OA text will be revised 
as set forth below.
Subsection II.B.4.b. (Transfer Agent Required Notices)
    The proposed rule change will revise this subsection II. B. 4. b. 
of the OA to (i) remove the Current Submission Methods as the accepted 
methods for submission of 17Ad-16 Notices to DTC, (ii) provide that the 
Issuer Agent Portal is the only means for transfer agents to submit 
17Ad-16 Notices to DTC and give a brief description of the Issuer Agent 
Portal,\18\ (iii) provide the link to the web page \19\ where the 
Issuer Agent Portal is available, (iv) specify that agents must use a 
function within the Issuer Agent Portal referred to as the Transfer 
Agent 17Ad-16 Notices function (``17Ad-16 Function'') when submitting 
17Ad-16 Notices, (v) state that the 17Ad-16 Function requires 
completion of certain mandatory fields

[[Page 70232]]

(a) relating to information required to be included in a 17Ad-16 Notice 
pursuant to Rule 17Ad-16 \20\ and (b) other information necessary for 
DTC to process a submission,\21\ (vi) state that optional fields may 
also be available,\22\ (vii) state that hard copy notices physically 
mailed to DTC and/or notices attached to or embedded in an email sent 
to DTC will not be posted to LENS and (viii) provide technical 
information on the features of the Issuer Agent Portal, including that 
(a) after an agent makes a successful input of the 17Ad-16 Notice and 
required information, the agent may review the information and make any 
changes, if necessary, and submit the details for posting to LENS, (b) 
the Issuer Agent Portal will provide functionality for the agent to 
save and export, a copy of the information for its own records and (c) 
state that a confirmation email will be sent to the submitting 
agent.\23\ The revised OA text will also provide that if an agent does 
not receive a confirmation email, it should consider submission of the 
17Ad-16 Notice as incomplete and not submitted to LENS, and that the 
agent should resubmit the 17Ad-16 Notice.
---------------------------------------------------------------------------

    \18\ There is no cost to parties submitting through the Issuer 
Agent Portal, and registration to use the Issuer Agent Portal is not 
required. Since the submitting party is submitting public data, it 
is not required to have a registration account. Submitters of LENS 
Notices would use a public facing site, the Issuer Agent Portal, and 
submit details/documents using an email address to receive a 
verification code, and complete a test to ensure the submitter is a 
human (i.e., CAPTCHA verification). In this regard, the proposed new 
submission method using the Issuer Agent Portal would provide for 
enhanced verification of the identity of submitters in comparison to 
the Current Submission Methods.
    \19\ Available at <a href="https://issueragentservices.dtcc.com">https://issueragentservices.dtcc.com</a>.
    \20\ Information required to be included in a 17Ad-16 Notice 
pursuant to Rule 17Ad-16 includes (i) contact information of the 
transfer agent, (ii) Financial Industry Number Standard (``FINS'') 
number of the submitting transfer agent and (iii) issuer name, issue 
or issues handled and, if applicable, respective CUSIP numbers. A 
FINS number is a unique number issued by DTC and used by the 
securities industry as a means of identifying financial institutions 
in automated data processing systems. See Notice of Assumption or 
Termination of Transfer Agent Services, Securities Exchange Act 
Release No. 35039 (Dec. 1, 1994), 59 FR 63656 (Dec. 8, 1994) (S7-1-
92) n 12.
    \21\ Such information includes, but may not be limited to, the 
transfer agent indicating whether the relevant issue or issues are 
held in DTC's Fast Automated Securities Transfer (``FAST'') program.
    \22\ Optional fields may include, but not be limited to, 
identifying information for the agent involved in the change of 
transfer agent services that is not the submitter of the notice. For 
example, if a transfer agent that is submitting a notice to the 
Issuer Agent Portal is assuming services for an issue, the portal 
may provide an optional field or fields for that transfer agent to 
provide certain identifying information, if known, relating to the 
transfer agent that is terminating its services for the issue.
    \23\ The confirmation email representing a successful submission 
is sent to a transfer agent's business email in near real-time. The 
text will state that transfer agents should check their spam, 
clutter, or junk folders if they do not receive the submission 
confirmation email.
---------------------------------------------------------------------------

    The subsection will also state that all information is posted to 
LENS in a standardized format reflecting the information submitted by 
the agent and that agents should retain a copy of all information they 
submit for their own records.
    An email address will also be provided for inquiries to DTC 
relating to the 17Ad-16 Notice process.
Subsections II.B.4.c. and d. (Termination of Transfer Agent Services/
Assumption of Transfer Agent Services)
    Subsections II.B.4.c. and d. would be deleted. These sections 
itemize information currently required to be included in a 17Ad-16 
Notice relating to the termination of transfer agent services or the 
assumption of transfer agent services, as applicable. Since these lists 
are derived primarily from Rule 17Ad-16 itself, it is unnecessary to 
state them in the OA. In this regard, DTC would replace these lists 
with the general description of required information, as stated above, 
with respect to revised subsection II.B.4.b.
Re-Lettered Subsection II.B.4.e. (To Be Re-Lettered as II. B. 4. c.) 
(Transfer Agent's Change of Name or Address)
    Subsection II.B.4.e. will be re-lettered as II. B. 4. c. to reflect 
the changes to the subsections described above.
    This subsection notes the type of information that a transfer agent 
must provide in a notice if it is changing its name or address. This 
information includes (i) certain contact information of the agent, (ii) 
FINS Number, (iii) agent number and (iv) the location where security 
certificates shall be received for transfer and re-registration. Rule 
17Ad-16 requires the transfer agent's notice to include all this 
information in its notice except for the agent number. To conform the 
list of required items in this subsection to Rule 17Ad-16, DTC proposes 
to revise this subsection to eliminate the agent's number \24\ as a 
required item.\25\
---------------------------------------------------------------------------

    \24\ The agent number is assigned by DTC on its ``Agent 
Masterfile.''
    \25\ See 17 CFR 240.17Ad-16(b).
---------------------------------------------------------------------------

    This subsection would also note that hard copy notices physically 
mailed to DTC and/or notices attached to or embedded in an email sent 
to DTC will not be posted to LENS.
    An email address will also be provided for inquiries to DTC 
relating to the 17Ad-16 Notice process, and certain technical and 
clarifying changes will be made to this subsection's text.
Re-Lettered Subsection II.B.4.f. (To Be Re-Lettered as II.B.4.d.) 
(Posting of Transfer Agent Notices to LENS)
    Subsection II.B.4.f. will be re-lettered as II.B.4.e. to reflect 
the lettering change related to the consolidation of Subsections 
II.B.4.c. and II.B.4.d.
    The text of this subsection will be revised to change an existing 
reference that a 17Ad-16 Notice is ``sent'' to DTC to instead state 
that a 17Ad-16 Notice is ``submitted'' to DTC, in order to reflect the 
proposed submission change through the Issuer Agent Portal.
New Subsection II.B.4.e. (Legal and Tax Notices)
    The Issuer Agent Portal will include a new Legal & Tax function to 
be used by transfer agents to submit to LENS legal, tax and other forms 
of public investor communications \26\ unrelated to corporate 
actions.\27\ The OA text would be updated to state that this function 
must be used for these types of communications. Like submissions using 
the 17Ad-16 Function, the Issuer Agent Portal will generate an email 
confirmation upon successful receipt of notice submissions for legal 
and tax notices. An email address will also be provided for inquiries 
to DTC relating to the notice process.
---------------------------------------------------------------------------

    \26\ See Securities Exchange Act Release No. 43964 (Feb. 14, 
2001), 66 FR 11190 (Feb. 22, 2001) (File No. SR-DTC-00-18) n.6.
    \27\ The process for submitting notices for specific types of 
corporate actions notifications is defined in applicable sections 
relating to processing of corporate actions in the OA.
---------------------------------------------------------------------------

    Text would be added to clarify that the Issuer Agent Portal is the 
only facility where transfer agents can submit such forms of public 
investor communications that are not related to corporate actions to 
DTC. The text would also state that hard copy notices physically mailed 
to DTC and/or notices embedded in an email sent to DTC will not be 
posted to LENS.
Re-Lettered Subsection II.B.4.g. (To Be Re-Lettered as II.B.4.f.) 
(Other Notices Delivered by Transfer Agents for Posting to LENS)
    Subsection II.B.4.g. will be re-lettered as II.B.4.f. to reflect 
the lettering change related to the consolidation of Subsections 
II.B.4.c. and II.B.4.d.
    This subsection provides requirements for submission of other types 
of notices to LENS including but not limited to closing memoranda, new 
issue memoranda, mutual fund memoranda and notices for ineligible 
securities. The proposed rule change would revise this section to 
reflect that such notices must be submitted to DTC through the 17Ad-16 
Function of the Issuer Agent Portal, rather than via email, as they are 
currently submitted.
    A disclaimer stating that DTC does not screen notices for posting 
to LENS would be revised to reflect the new mechanism through the 
Issuer Agent Portal for the submission of notices and clarify that DTC 
does not screen such notices from issuers, agents and trustees.\28\
---------------------------------------------------------------------------

    \28\ The current text only specifies that DTC does not screen 
notices received from transfer agents.

---------------------------------------------------------------------------

[[Page 70233]]

    The proposed rule change would provide clarifying text that notices 
relating to corporate actions (except for bankruptcy notices) \29\ 
should not be submitted through the Issuer Agent Portal. Other sections 
of the OA provide instructions on the submission of corporate actions 
notices.
---------------------------------------------------------------------------

    \29\ Bankruptcy notices would be submitted via the Issuer Agent 
Portal by selecting Legal and Tax Notices.
---------------------------------------------------------------------------

Subsection II.B.5. (Trustee Required Notices)
    This subsection provides instructions for trustees for providing 
notices with respect to a change in trustee with respect to an issue of 
securities. While DTC understands that trustees may not be transfer 
agents, and thus may not subject be to Rule 17Ad-16, the information 
provided for such notices is like that required for 17Ad-16 Notices. 
Therefore, the proposed rule change would revise the text of this 
subsection to remove references to the Current Submission Methods as 
acceptable means for submitting such notices, and direct that these 
notices should be submitted through the 17Ad-16 Function.\30\ The 
Subsection would state that hard copy notices physically mailed to DTC 
and/or notices embedded in an email sent to DTC will not be posted to 
LENS.
---------------------------------------------------------------------------

    \30\ If the trustee believes that a field within in the 17Ad-16 
Function is not applicable to a trustee (as opposed to a transfer 
agent), the trustee should leave the field blank.
---------------------------------------------------------------------------

    An email address will also be provided for inquiries to DTC 
relating to the notice process.
Subsection II.B.6. (LIBOR Replacement Index Communication Tool)
    Subsection II.B.6. provides instructions for use of the LIBOR 
Replacement Index Communication Tool (``Communication Tool''), which is 
designed to help issuers, trustees and agents communicate via LENS 
certain LIBOR benchmark replacement information for securities that are 
converting from LIBOR (USD) to an alternative reference rate.\31\ The 
OA currently provides a URL to a web page where users may access the 
Communication Tool. Upon implementation of the proposed rule change, 
the OA will be updated to instruct transfer agents to use the LIBOR 
function of the Issuer Agent Portal \32\ to access the Communication 
Tool, and the text of this subsection will be updated accordingly.
---------------------------------------------------------------------------

    \31\ See Securities Exchange Act Release No. 97009 (Mar. 1, 
2023), 88 FR 14221 (Mar. 7, 2023) (File No. SR-DTC-2023-002).
    \32\ Supra note 19.
---------------------------------------------------------------------------

Effective Date
    The proposed changes will be implemented by no later than August 
23, 2024, on a date to be announced by Important Notice.
2. Statutory Basis
    Section 17A(b)(3)(F) of the Act \33\ requires that the rules of the 
clearing agency be designed, inter alia, to foster cooperation and 
coordination with persons engaged in the clearance and settlement of 
securities transactions. As described above, the proposed rule change 
would help facilitate the posting of LENS Notices containing 
information relating to securities held at DTC, by removing an 
outdated, manual process of making LENS Notices available to 
Participants that hold the securities through their DTC Accounts and 
settle transactions in them through DTC, in favor of the newer, more 
efficient method of posting LENS Notices using the Issuer Agent Portal. 
In this regard, DTC believes that the proposed rule change would foster 
cooperation and coordination with persons engaged in the clearance and 
settlement of securities transactions by facilitating posting Notices 
to LENS through using a more automated, straight-through processing 
method for distribution of LENS Notices to such Participants. 
Therefore, by facilitating a more automated and efficient method of 
transmission of straight-through processing method for distribution of 
notices to Participants that may hold such securities and settle 
transaction in them through DTC, DTC believes that the proposed rule 
change is consistent with the requirements of the Act, in particular 
Section 17A(b)(3)(F) of the Act, cited above.
---------------------------------------------------------------------------

    \33\ 15 U.S.C. 78q-1(b)(3)(F).
---------------------------------------------------------------------------

    Rule 17ad-22(e)(21) \34\ promulgated under the Act requires, inter 
alia, that DTC, a covered clearing agency, establish, implement, 
maintain and enforce written policies and procedures reasonably 
designed to, as applicable, be efficient and effective in meeting the 
requirements of its participants and the markets it serves. As 
described above, the proposed rule change would update the OA to 
establish a more centralized and improved means for DTC to receive 
Notices more efficiently and effectively through the Issuer Agent 
Portal than via an email submission and to provide for the automated 
posting of Notices to LENS for Participant consumption. In this regard, 
DTC believes that the proposed rule change would provide a more 
streamlined approach for issuers, trustees and agents to disseminate 
Notices to Participants, and ultimately their customers, regarding 
securities that they may hold and processed through DTC. Therefore, DTC 
believes that the proposed rule change would help promote efficiency 
and effectiveness by helping DTC better meet the requirements of its 
participants and the markets it serves, consistent with Rule 17ad-
22(e)(21).
---------------------------------------------------------------------------

    \34\ 17 CFR 240.17ad-22(e)(21).
---------------------------------------------------------------------------

(B) Clearing Agency's Statement on Burden on Competition

    DTC does not believe that the proposed rule change will have any 
impact, or impose any burden, on competition.
    As described above, the proposed rule change consists of changes to 
the OA that will provide for the submission of LENS Notices for posting 
to LENS via the Issuer Agent Portal. The Issuer Agent Portal will be 
publicly available on DTCC's web page and DTC believes the portal will 
be as readily accessible to submitters of LENS Notices as the Current 
Submission Methods. Consistent with current practice, issuers, agents 
and trustees will not be charged for submission of LENS Notices.

(C) Clearing Agency's Statement on Comments on the Proposed Rule Change 
Received From Members, Participants, or Others

    DTC has not received or solicited any written comments relating to 
this proposal. If any written comments are received, they would be 
publicly filed as an Exhibit 2 to this filing, as required by Form 19b-
4 and the General Instructions thereto.\35\
---------------------------------------------------------------------------

    \35\ DTC has conducted outreach to transfer agents to discuss 
the proposed Issuer Agent Portal. DTC also held a webinar to discuss 
the Issuer Agent Portal with the transfer agent community. DTC has 
provided transfer agents with access to test the Issuer Agent Portal 
and has established a dedicated email box for transfer agents to 
provide feedback on the functionality of the Issuer Agent Portal. 
DTC has added information and responses to frequently asked 
questions to the web page dedicated to the Issuer Agent Portal, 
available at <a href="https://www.dtcc.com/settlement-and-asset-services/issuer-services/issuer-agent-portal">https://www.dtcc.com/settlement-and-asset-services/issuer-services/issuer-agent-portal</a>.
---------------------------------------------------------------------------

    Persons submitting comments are cautioned that, according to 
Section IV (Solicitation of Comments) of the Exhibit 1A in the General 
Instructions to Form 19b-4, the Commission does not edit personal 
identifying information from comment submissions. Commenters should
