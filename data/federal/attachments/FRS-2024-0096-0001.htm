Final Approval Under OMB Delegated Authority of the Extension for Three 
Years, Without Revision, of the Following Information Collection

    Collection title: Quarterly Report of Interest Rates on Selected 
Direct Consumer Installment Loans and the Quarterly Report of Credit 
Card Plans.
    Collection identifier: FR 2835 and FR 2835a.
    OMB control number: 7100-0085.
    General description of collection: The FR 2835 collects information 
on interest rates on loans for new vehicles and loans for other 
consumer goods and personal expenses from a sample of commercial banks. 
The FR 2835a collects information on interest rates, finance charges, 
and loan balances for credit card accounts from a sample of commercial 
banks. The data from these reports help the Board analyze current 
household financial conditions and the implications of these conditions 
for household spending and, as such, these data provide valuable input 
to the monetary policymaking process. The data are also used to create 
aggregate statistics on consumer loan terms that are published in the 
some of the Federal Reserve's monthly statistical releases.
    Frequency: Quarterly.
    Respondents: The FR 2835 panel comprises a sample of commercial 
banks. The FR 2835a panel comprises a sample of commercial banks with 
$1 billion or more in credit card receivables and a representative 
group of smaller issuers.
    Total estimated number of respondents: 200.
    Total estimated annual burden hours: 274.\1\

in strong support of the continued collection of the FR 2835 and FR 
2835a data. The Board will adopt the extension, without revision of the 
FR 2835 and FR 2835a as originally proposed.

    Board of Governors of the Federal Reserve System.
