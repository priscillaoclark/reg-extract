SECURITIES AND EXCHANGE COMMISSION

[SEC File No. 270-662, OMB Control No. 3235-0720]


Proposed Collection; Comment Request; Extension: Form 1-K

Upon Written Request Copies Available From: Securities and Exchange 
Commission, Office of FOIA Services, 100 F Street NE, Washington, DC 
20549-2736

    Notice is hereby given that, pursuant to the Paperwork Reduction 
Act of 1995 (44 U.S.C. 3501 et seq.), the Securities and Exchange 
Commission (``Commission'') is soliciting comments on the collection of 
information summarized below. The Commission plans to submit this 
existing collection of information to the Office of Management and 
Budget for extension and approval.
    Form 1-K (17 CFR 239.91) is used to file annual reports by Tier 2 
issuers under Regulation A, an exemption from registration under the 
Securities Act of 1933 (15 U.S.C. 77a et seq.). Tier 2 issuers under 
Regulation A conducting offerings of up to $50 million within a 12-
month period are required to file Form 1-K. Form 1-K provides audited 
year-end financial statements and information about the issuer's 
business operation, ownership, management, liquidity, capital resources 
and operations on an annual basis. In addition, Part I of the Form 1-K 
collects information on any offerings under Regulation A that have been 
terminated or completed unless it has been previous reported on Form 1-
Z. The purpose of the Form 1-K is to better inform the public about 
companies that have conducted Tier 2 offerings under Regulation A. We 
estimate that approximately 353 issuers file Form 1-K annually. We 
estimate that Form 1-K takes approximately 600 hours to prepare. We 
estimate that 75% of the 600 hours per response (450 hours) is prepared 
by the company for a total annual burden of 158,850 hours (450 hours 
per response x 353 responses).
    Written comments are invited on: (a) whether this proposed 
collection of information is necessary for the proper performance of 
the functions of the agency, including whether the information will 
have practical utility; (b) the accuracy of the agency's estimate of 
the burden imposed by the collection of information; (c) ways to 
enhance the quality, utility, and clarity of the information collected; 
and (d) ways to minimize the burden of the collection of information on 
respondents, including through the use of automated collection 
techniques or other forms of information technology. Consideration will 
be given to comments and suggestions submitted in writing within 60 
days of this publication by October 15, 2024.
    An agency may not conduct or sponsor, and a person is not required 
to respond to, a collection of information unless it displays a 
currently valid control number.
    Please direct your written comment to Austin Gerig, Director/Chief 
Data Officer, Securities and Exchange Commission, c/o Oluwaseun Ajayi, 
100 F Street NE, Washington, DC 20549 or send an email to:

Secretary.
