No. 3038-0096.

SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION: 
    Title: Swap Data Recordkeeping and Reporting Requirements (OMB 
Control No. 3038-0096). This is a request for revision of a currently 
approved information collection.
    Abstract: The collection of information is needed to ensure that 
the CFTC and other regulators have access to swap data as required by 
the Commodity Exchange Act, as amended by the Dodd-Frank Wall Street 
Reform and Consumer Protection Act (``Dodd-Frank Act''). The Dodd-Frank 
Act directed the CFTC to adopt rules providing for the reporting of 
data relating to swaps. In 2012, the CFTC adopted Regulation 45, which 
imposes recordkeeping and reporting requirements relating to swaps. The 
Commission is revising its burden hours and hourly labor cost estimates 
following the Commission's designation of a Unique Product Identifier 
(``UPI'') and product classification system for certain swap asset 
classes. The Commission is revising its burden estimates associated 
with the reporting obligations under part 45 of the Commission rules to 
account for new burden associated with the requirements of Sec.  45.7.
    An agency may not conduct or sponsor, and a person is not required 
to respond to, a collection of information unless it displays a 
currently valid OMB control number. On July 6, 2023, the Commission 
published in the Federal Register notice of the proposed revision of 
this information collection and provided 60 days for public comment on 
the proposed extension, 88 FR 43086 (``60-Day Notice''). The Commission 
received no relevant comments that addressed its PRA burden estimates.
    Burden Statement: CFTC regulation section 45.7 results in 
information collection requirements within the meaning of the PRA. With 
respect to the ongoing reporting and recordkeeping burdens associated 
with swaps, the CFTC believes that SDs, MSPs, SEFs, DCMs, DCOs, SDRs, 
and non-SD/MSP counterparties incur an annual time-burden of 1,093 
hours. This time-burden represents a proportion of the burden 
respondents incur to operate and maintain their swap data recordkeeping 
and reporting systems.
    In addition, the Commission estimates that regulation section 45.7 
will create costs for entities required to retrieve and transmit UPIs 
to update their systems to retrieve and transmit UPIs. The Commission 
estimates that SDRs, SEFs, DCMs, and reporting counterparties required 
to retrieve and transmit UPIs will incur a one-time initial burden of 
one hour per entity to modify their systems to adopt the required 
changes, for a total estimated hours burden of 1,732 hours. The 
associated labor cost per entity is estimated to be $93.31 for a total 
cost across entities of $161,620.
    Respondents/Affected Entities: Swap Dealers, Major Swap 
Participants, SEFs, DCMs, DCOs, and other counterparties to a swap 
transaction (i.e., end-user, non-SD/non-MSP counterparties).
    Estimated number of respondents: 1,732.
    Estimated average burden hours per respondent: 1.6 hours.
    Estimated total annual burden hours on respondents: 2,825 hours.
    Frequency of collection: Ongoing.
    There are no capital costs or operating and maintenance costs 
associated with this collection.

(Authority: 44 U.S.C. 3501 et seq.)

    Dated: September 8, 2023.
Christopher Kirkpatrick,
Secretary of the Commission.
