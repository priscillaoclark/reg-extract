SECURITIES AND EXCHANGE COMMISSION

[SEC File No. 270-563, OMB Control No. 3235-0649]


Submission for OMB Review; Comment Request; Extension: Rule 17g-5

Upon Written Request, Copies Available From: Securities and Exchange 
Commission, Office of FOIA Services, 100 F Street NE, Washington, DC 
20549-2736

    Notice is hereby given that pursuant to the Paperwork Reduction Act 
of 1995 (44 U.S.C. 3501 et seq.), the Securities and Exchange 
Commission (``Commission'') is soliciting comments on the collection of 
information summarized below. The Commission plans to submit an 
extension for this current collection of information to the Office of 
Management and Budget for approval.
    Rule 17g-5(a)(3) and (e) (17 CFR 240.17g-5(a)(3) and (e)) contain 
collection of information requirements. Specifically, Rule 17g-5(a)(3) 
prohibits a person within a nationally recognized statistical rating 
organization (``NRSRO'') from having a conflict of interest relating to 
the issuance or maintenance of a credit rating for a security or money 
market instrument issued by an asset pool or as part of any asset-
backed securities transaction that was paid for by the issuer, sponsor, 
or underwriter of the security or money market instrument unless 
certain information and representations relating to the security are 
disclosed or furnished.
    Currently, there are 6 credit rating agencies registered as NRSROs 
in the issuer of asset-backed securities category of credit ratings, 
and it is estimated based on recent issuance data that there are 
approximately 1,480 new asset-backed securities transactions per year 
that implicate Rule 17g-5(a)(3). Based on Commission staff's 
experience, it is estimated that the total annual hour burden to comply 
with Rule 17g-5(a)(3) will be 61,899 hours. The Commission further 
estimates that this annual hour burden will result in a total annual 
cost of $14,126,168. This cost is attributable to costs that may be 
incurred by NRSROs and arrangers of asset-backed securities posting 
information on a password-protected website, as required by Rule 17g-5, 
and preparing and procuring representations to determine whether an 
exemption under the rule applies, as well as costs incurred by NRSROs 
preparing certifications required under the rule to gain access to 
websites maintained by other NRSROs or arrangers of asset-backed 
securities.
    An agency may not conduct or sponsor, and a person is not required 
to respond to, a collection of information under the PRA unless it 
displays a currently valid OMB control number.
    The public may view background documentation for this information 
collection at the following website: <a href="http://www.reginfo.gov">www.reginfo.gov</a>. Find this 
particular information collection by selecting ``Currently under 30-day 
Review--Open for Public Comments'' or by using the search function. 
Written comments and recommendations for the proposed information 
collection should be sent within 30 days of publication of this notice 
by September 13, 2024 to (i) <a href="http://www.reginfo.gov/public/do/PRAMain">www.reginfo.gov/public/do/PRAMain</a> and (ii) 
Austin Gerig, Director/Chief Data Officer, Securities and Exchange 
Commission, c/o Oluwaseun Ajayi, 100 F Street, NE, Washington, DC 
20549, or by sending an email to: <a href="/cdn-cgi/l/email-protection#7a2a283b25371b13161815023a091f19541d150c"><span class="__cf_email__" data-cfemail="aafaf8ebf5e7cbc3c6c8c5d2ead9cfc984cdc5dc">[email&#160;protected]</span></a>.

    Dated: August 9, 2024.
Vanessa A. Countryman,
Secretary.
