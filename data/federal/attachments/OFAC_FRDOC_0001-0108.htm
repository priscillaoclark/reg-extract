Background

    On June 16, 2006, the President, invoking the authority of, inter 
alia, the International Emergency Economic Powers Act (50 U.S.C. 1701-
1706) (``IEEPA''), issued Executive Order 13405 (71 FR 35485, June 20, 
2006) (``E.O. 13405''), effective at 12:01 a.m. eastern daylight time 
on June 19, 2006. In E.O. 13405, the President determined that the 
actions and policies of certain members of the Government of Belarus 
and other persons to undermine Belarus democratic processes or 
institutions, which were manifested in the fundamentally undemocratic 
March 2006 elections, to commit human rights abuses related to 
political repression, including detentions and disappearances, and to 
engage in public corruption, including by diverting or misusing 
Belarusian public assets or by misusing public authority, constitute an 
unusual and extraordinary threat to the national security and foreign 
policy of the United States and declared a national emergency to deal 
with that threat.
    Section 1(a) of E.O. 13405 blocks, with certain exceptions, all 
property and interests in property that are in the United States, that 
come within the United States, or that are or come within the 
possession or control of any United States person, including any 
overseas branch, of: (1) The persons listed in the Annex to E.O. 13405; 
and (2) any person determined by the Secretary of the Treasury, after 
consultation with the Secretary of State: (i) To be responsible for, or 
to have participated in, actions or policies that undermine democratic 
processes or institutions in Belarus; (ii) to be responsible for, or to 
have participated in, human rights abuses related to political 
repression in Belarus; (iii) to be a senior-level official, a family 
member of such an official, or a person closely linked to such an 
official who is responsible for or has engaged in public corruption 
related to Belarus; (iv) to have materially assisted, sponsored, or 
provided financial, material, or technological support for, or goods or 
services in support of, the activities described above or any person 
listed in or designated pursuant to E.O. 13405; or (v) to be owned or 
controlled by, or acting or purporting to act for or on behalf of, 
directly or indirectly, any person listed in or designated pursuant to 
E.O. 13405. The property and interests in property of the persons 
described above may not be transferred, paid, exported, withdrawn, or 
otherwise dealt in.
    In Section 1(b) of E.O. 13405, the President determined that the 
making of donations of certain articles, such as food, clothing, and 
medicine, intended to be used to relieve human suffering, as specified 
in section 203(b)(2) of IEEPA (50 U.S.C. 1702(b)(2)), by, to, or for 
the benefit of any person whose property and interests in property are 
blocked pursuant to E.O. 13405 would seriously impair his ability to 
deal with the national emergency declared in E.O. 13405. The President 
therefore prohibited the donation of such items unless authorized by 
OFAC.
    Section 1(c) of E.O. 13405 provides that the prohibition on any 
transaction or dealing in blocked property or interests in property 
includes, but is not limited to, the making of any contribution or 
provision of funds, goods, or services by, to, or for the benefit of 
any person whose property and interests in property are blocked 
pursuant to E.O. 13405, and the receipt of any contribution or 
provision of funds, goods, or services from any such person.
    Section 2 of E.O. 13405 prohibits any transaction by a United 
States person or within the United States that evades or avoids, has 
the purpose of evading or avoiding, or attempts to violate any of the 
prohibitions set forth in E.O. 13405, as well as any conspiracy formed 
to violate such prohibitions.
    Section 5 of E.O. 13405 authorizes the Secretary of the Treasury, 
after consultation with the Secretary of State, to take such actions, 
including the promulgation of rules and regulations, and to employ all 
powers granted to the President by IEEPA, as may be necessary to carry 
out the purposes of E.O. 13405. Section 5 of E.O. 13405 also provides 
that the Secretary of the Treasury may redelegate any of these 
functions to other officers and agencies of the U.S. Government. In 
furtherance of the purposes of E.O. 13405, OFAC is promulgating the 
Belarus Sanctions Regulations, 31 CFR part 548 (the ``Regulations'').
    The Regulations implement targeted sanctions that are directed at 
certain persons who meet the criteria set forth above. The sanctions 
generally do not prohibit trade or the provision of banking or other 
financial services to the country of Belarus, unless the transaction or 
service in question involves a person whose property and interests in 
property are blocked pursuant to these sanctions.
    Subpart A of the Regulations clarifies the relation of this part to 
other laws and regulations. Subpart B of the Regulations implements the 
prohibitions contained in sections 1 and 2 of E.O. 13405. See, e.g., 
Sec. Sec.  548.201 and 548.205. Persons identified in the Annex to E.O. 
13405, designated by or under the authority of the Secretary of the 
Treasury pursuant to E.O. 13405, or otherwise subject to the blocking 
provisions of E.O. 13405 are referred to throughout the Regulations as 
``persons whose property and interests in property are blocked pursuant 
to Sec.  548.201(a).'' The names of persons listed in or designated 
pursuant to E.O. 13405 are published on OFAC's Specially Designated 
Nationals and Blocked Persons List, which is accessible via OFAC's Web 
site. Those names also are published in the Federal

[[Page 5503]]

Register as they are added to the List, and the entire List is 
republished annually as Appendix A to 31 CFR chapter V.
    Sections 548.202 and 548.203 of subpart B detail the effect of 
transfers of blocked property in violation of the Regulations and set 
forth the requirement to hold blocked funds, such as currency, bank 
deposits, or liquidated financial obligations, in interest-bearing 
blocked accounts. Section 548.204 of subpart B provides that all 
expenses incident to the maintenance of blocked physical property shall 
be the responsibility of the owners and operators of such property, and 
that such expenses shall not be met from blocked funds, unless 
otherwise authorized. The section further provides that blocked 
property may, in OFAC's discretion, be sold or liquidated and the net 
proceeds placed in a blocked interest-bearing account in the name of 
the owner of the property.
    Section 548.205 of subpart B implements the prohibitions of E.O. 
13405 on any transaction by a United States person or within the United 
States that evades or avoids, has the purpose of evading or avoiding, 
or attempts to violate any of the prohibitions set forth in E.O. 13405, 
and on any conspiracy formed to violate such prohibitions.
    Section 548.206 of subpart B details transactions that are exempt 
from the prohibitions of the Regulations pursuant to sections 
203(b)(1), (3), and (4) of IEEPA (50 U.S.C. 1702(b)(1), (3), and (4)). 
These exempt transactions relate to personal communications, the 
importation and exportation of information or informational materials, 
and transactions ordinarily incident to travel.
    Subpart C of the Regulations defines key terms used throughout the 
Regulations, and subpart D contains interpretive sections regarding the 
Regulations. Section 548.411 of subpart D explains that the property 
and interests in property of an entity are blocked if the entity is 50 
percent or more owned by a person whose property and interests in 
property are blocked, whether or not the entity itself is listed in or 
designated pursuant to E.O. 13405.
    Transactions otherwise prohibited under the Regulations but found 
to be consistent with U.S. policy may be authorized by one of the 
general licenses contained in subpart E of the Regulations or by a 
specific license issued pursuant to the procedures described in subpart 
E of 31 CFR part 501. Subpart E of the Regulations also contains 
certain statements of licensing policy in addition to the general 
licenses.
    Subpart F of the Regulations refers to subpart C of part 501 for 
applicable recordkeeping and reporting requirements. Subpart G of the 
Regulations describes the civil and criminal penalties applicable to 
violations of the Regulations, as well as the procedures governing the 
potential imposition of a civil monetary penalty. Subpart G also refers 
to Appendix A of part 501 for a more complete description of these 
procedures.
    Subpart H of the Regulations refers to subpart E of part 501 for 
applicable provisions relating to administrative procedures and 
contains a delegation of authority by the Secretary of the Treasury. 
Subpart I of the Regulations sets forth a Paperwork Reduction Act 
notice.

Public Participation

    Because the Regulations involve a foreign affairs function, the 
provisions of Executive Order 12866 and the Administrative Procedure 
Act (5 U.S.C. 553) requiring notice of proposed rulemaking, opportunity 
for public participation, and delay in effective date are inapplicable. 
Because no notice of proposed rulemaking is required for this rule, the 
Regulatory Flexibility Act (5 U.S.C. 601-612) does not apply.

Paperwork Reduction Act

    The collections of information related to the Regulations are 
contained in 31 CFR part 501 (the ``Reporting, Procedures and Penalties 
Regulations''). Pursuant to the Paperwork Reduction Act of 1995 (44 
U.S.C. 3507), those collections of information have been approved by 
the Office of Management and Budget under control number 1505-0164. An 
agency may not conduct or sponsor, and a person is not required to 
respond to, a collection of information unless the collection of 
information displays a valid control number.

List of Subjects in 31 CFR Part 548

    Administrative practice and procedure, Banks, Banking, Belarus, 
Blocking of assets, Credit, Foreign trade, Penalties, Reporting and 
recordkeeping requirements, Securities, Services.

Subpart A--Relation of This Part to Other Laws and Regulations


Sec.  548.101  Relation of this part to other laws and regulations.

    This part is separate from, and independent of, the other parts of 
this chapter, with the exception of part 501 of this chapter, the 
recordkeeping and reporting requirements and license application and 
other procedures of which apply to this part. Actions taken pursuant to 
part 501 of this chapter with respect to the prohibitions contained in 
this part are considered actions taken pursuant to this part. Differing 
foreign policy and national security circumstances may result in 
differing interpretations of similar language among the parts of this 
chapter. No license or authorization contained in or issued pursuant to 
those other parts authorizes any transaction prohibited by this part. 
No license or authorization contained in or issued pursuant to any 
other provision of law or regulation authorizes any transaction 
prohibited by this part. No license or authorization contained in or 
issued pursuant to this part relieves the involved parties from 
complying with any other applicable laws or regulations.

Subpart B--Prohibitions


Sec.  548.201  Prohibited transactions involving blocked property.

    (a) All property and interests in property that are in the United 
States, that hereafter come within the United States, or that are or 
hereafter come within the possession or control of U.S. persons, 
including their overseas branches, of the following persons are blocked 
and may not be transferred, paid, exported, withdrawn, or otherwise 
dealt in:
    (1) Any person listed in the Annex to Executive Order 13405 of June 
16, 2006 (71 FR 35485, June 20, 2006); and
    (2) Any person determined by the Secretary of the Treasury, after 
consultation with the Secretary of State:
    (i) To be responsible for, or to have participated in, actions or 
policies that undermine democratic processes or institutions in 
Belarus;
    (ii) To be responsible for, or to have participated in, human 
rights abuses related to political repression in Belarus;
    (iii) To be a senior-level official, a family member of such an 
official, or a person closely linked to such an official who is 
responsible for or has engaged in public corruption related to Belarus;
    (iv) To have materially assisted, sponsored, or provided financial, 
material, or technological support for, or goods or services in support 
of, the activities described in paragraphs (a)(2)(i) through 
(a)(2)(iii) of this section or any person whose property or interests 
in property are blocked pursuant to this paragraph (a); or
    (v) To be owned or controlled by, or acting or purporting to act 
for or on behalf of, directly or indirectly, any person whose property 
or interests in property are blocked pursuant to this paragraph (a).

    Note 1 to paragraph (a) of Sec.  548.201: The names of persons 
listed in or designated pursuant to Executive Order 13405, whose 
property and interests in property are blocked pursuant to paragraph 
(a) of this section, are published on the Office of Foreign Assets 
Control's Specially Designated Nationals and Blocked Persons List 
(``SDN'' list) (which is accessible via the Office of Foreign Assets 
Control's Web site), published in the Federal Register, and 
incorporated into Appendix A to this chapter with the identifier 
``[BELARUS].'' See Sec.  548.411 concerning entities that may not be 
listed on the SDN list but whose property and interests in property 
are nevertheless blocked pursuant to paragraph (a) of this section.
    Note 2 to paragraph (a) of Sec.  548.201: The International 
Emergency Economic Powers Act (50 U.S.C. 1701-1706) (``IEEPA''), in 
section 203 (50 U.S.C. 1702), explicitly authorizes the blocking of 
property and interests in property of a person during the pendency 
of an investigation. The names of persons whose property and 
interests in property are blocked pending investigation pursuant to 
this part also are published on the SDN list, published in the 
Federal Register, and incorporated into Appendix A to this chapter 
with the identifier ``[BPI-BELARUS].''
    Note 3 to paragraph (a) of Sec.  548.201: Sections 501.806 and 
501.807 of this chapter describe the procedures to be followed by 
persons seeking, respectively, the unblocking of funds that they 
believe were blocked due to mistaken identity, or administrative 
reconsideration of their status as persons whose property and 
interests in property are blocked pursuant to paragraph (a) of this 
section.

    (b) The prohibitions in paragraph (a) of this section include, but 
are not limited to, prohibitions on the following transactions:
    (1) The making of any contribution or provision of funds, goods, or 
services by, to, or for the benefit of any person whose property and 
interests in property are blocked pursuant to paragraph (a) of this 
section; and
    (2) The receipt of any contribution or provision of funds, goods, 
or services from any person whose property and interests in property 
are blocked pursuant to paragraph (a) of this section.
    (c) Unless otherwise authorized by this part or by a specific 
license expressly referring to this section, any dealing in any 
security (or evidence thereof) held within the possession or control of 
a U.S. person and either registered or inscribed in the name of, or 
known to be held for the benefit of, or issued by, any person whose 
property and interests in property are blocked pursuant to paragraph 
(a) of this section is prohibited. This prohibition includes but is not 
limited to the transfer (including the transfer on the books of any 
issuer or agent thereof), disposition, transportation, importation, 
exportation, or withdrawal of, or the endorsement or guaranty of 
signatures on, any such security on or after the effective date. This 
prohibition applies irrespective of the fact that at any time (whether 
prior to, on, or subsequent to the effective date) the registered or 
inscribed owner of any such security may have or might appear to have 
assigned, transferred, or otherwise disposed of the security.
    (d) The prohibitions in paragraph (a) of this section apply except 
to the extent transactions are authorized by regulations, orders, 
directives, rulings, instructions, licenses, or otherwise, and 
notwithstanding any contracts entered into or any license or permit 
granted prior to the effective date.


Sec.  548.202  Effect of transfers violating the provisions of this 
part.

    (a) Any transfer after the effective date that is in violation of 
any provision of this part or of any regulation, order, directive, 
ruling, instruction, or license issued pursuant to this part, and that 
involves any property or interest in property blocked pursuant to Sec.  
548.201(a), is null and void and shall not be the basis for the 
assertion or recognition of any interest in or right, remedy, power, or 
privilege with respect to such property or property interests.

[[Page 5505]]

    (b) No transfer before the effective date shall be the basis for 
the assertion or recognition of any right, remedy, power, or privilege 
with respect to, or any interest in, any property or interest in 
property blocked pursuant to Sec.  548.201(a), unless the person who 
holds or maintains such property, prior to that date, had written 
notice of the transfer or by any written evidence had recognized such 
transfer.
    (c) Unless otherwise provided, an appropriate license or other 
authorization issued by the Office of Foreign Assets Control before, 
during, or after a transfer shall validate such transfer or make it 
enforceable to the same extent that it would be valid or enforceable 
but for the provisions of IEEPA, Executive Order 13405, this part, and 
any regulation, order, directive, ruling, instruction, or license 
issued pursuant to this part.
    (d) Transfers of property that otherwise would be null and void or 
unenforceable by virtue of the provisions of this section shall not be 
deemed to be null and void or unenforceable as to any person with whom 
such property is or was held or maintained (and as to such person only) 
in cases in which such person is able to establish to the satisfaction 
of the Office of Foreign Assets Control each of the following:
    (1) Such transfer did not represent a willful violation of the 
provisions of this part by the person with whom such property is or was 
held or maintained (and as to such person only);
    (2) The person with whom such property is or was held or maintained 
did not have reasonable cause to know or suspect, in view of all the 
facts and circumstances known or available to such person, that such 
transfer required a license or authorization issued pursuant to this 
part and was not so licensed or authorized, or, if a license or 
authorization did purport to cover the transfer, that such license or 
authorization had been obtained by misrepresentation of a third party 
or withholding of material facts or was otherwise fraudulently 
obtained; and
    (3) The person with whom such property is or was held or maintained 
filed with the Office of Foreign Assets Control a report setting forth 
in full the circumstances relating to such transfer promptly upon 
discovery that:
    (i) Such transfer was in violation of the provisions of this part 
or any regulation, ruling, instruction, license, or other directive or 
authorization issued pursuant to this part;
    (ii) Such transfer was not licensed or authorized by the Office of 
Foreign Assets Control; or
    (iii) If a license did purport to cover the transfer, such license 
had been obtained by misrepresentation of a third party or withholding 
of material facts or was otherwise fraudulently obtained.

    Note to paragraph (d) of Sec.  548.202:  The filing of a report 
in accordance with the provisions of paragraph (d)(3) of this 
section shall not be deemed evidence that the terms of paragraphs 
(d)(1) and (d)(2) of this section have been satisfied.

    (e) Unless licensed pursuant to this part, any attachment, 
judgment, decree, lien, execution, garnishment, or other judicial 
process is null and void with respect to any property in which, on or 
since the effective date, there existed an interest of a person whose 
property and interests in property are blocked pursuant to Sec.  
548.201(a).


Sec.  548.203  Holding of funds in interest-bearing accounts; 
investment and reinvestment.

    (a) Except as provided in paragraphs (c) or (d) of this section, or 
as otherwise directed by the Office of Foreign Assets Control, any U.S. 
person holding funds, such as currency, bank deposits, or liquidated 
financial obligations, subject to Sec.  548.201(a) shall hold or place 
such funds in a blocked interest-bearing account located in the United 
States.
    (b)(1) For purposes of this section, the term blocked interest-
bearing account means a blocked account:
    (i) In a federally-insured U.S. bank, thrift institution, or credit 
union, provided the funds are earning interest at rates that are 
commercially reasonable; or
    (ii) With a broker or dealer registered with the Securities and 
Exchange Commission under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 (15 
U.S.C. 78a et seq.), provided the funds are invested in a money market 
fund or in U.S. Treasury bills.
    (2) For purposes of this section, a rate is commercially reasonable 
if it is the rate currently offered to other depositors on deposits or 
instruments of comparable size and maturity.
    (3) Funds held or placed in a blocked account pursuant to this 
paragraph (b) may not be invested in instruments the maturity of which 
exceeds 180 days. If interest is credited to a separate blocked account 
or subaccount, the name of the account party on each account must be 
the same.
    (c) Blocked funds held in instruments the maturity of which exceeds 
180 days at the time the funds become subject to Sec.  548.201(a) may 
continue to be held until maturity in the original instrument, provided 
any interest, earnings, or other proceeds derived therefrom are paid 
into a blocked interest-bearing account in accordance with paragraphs 
(b) or (d) of this section.
    (d) Blocked funds held in accounts or instruments outside the 
United States at the time the funds become subject to Sec.  548.201(a) 
may continue to be held in the same type of accounts or instruments, 
provided the funds earn interest at rates that are commercially 
reasonable.
    (e) This section does not create an affirmative obligation for the 
holder of blocked tangible property, such as chattels or real estate, 
or of other blocked property, such as debt or equity securities, to 
sell or liquidate such property. However, the Office of Foreign Assets

    (b) No regulation, ruling, instruction, or license authorizes any 
transaction prohibited under this part unless the regulation, ruling, 
instruction, or license is issued by the Office of Foreign Assets

authorize any transaction prohibited by any other part of this chapter 
unless the regulation, ruling, instruction, or license specifically 
refers to such part.
    (c) Any regulation, ruling, instruction, or license authorizing any

Sec.  548.701  Penalties.

    (a) Attention is directed to section 206 of the International 
Emergency Economic Powers Act (50 U.S.C. 1705) (``IEEPA''), which is 
applicable to violations of the provisions of any license, ruling, 
regulation, order, directive, or instruction issued by or pursuant to 
the direction or authorization of the Secretary of the Treasury 
pursuant to this part or otherwise under IEEPA.
    (1) A civil penalty not to exceed the amount set forth in section 
206 of IEEPA may be imposed on any person who violates, attempts to 
violate, conspires to violate, or causes a violation of any license, 
order, regulation, or prohibition issued under IEEPA.

    Note to paragraph (a)(1) of Sec.  548.701:  As of the date of 
publication in the Federal Register of the final rule adding this 
part to 31 CFR chapter V (February 3, 2010), IEEPA provides for a 
maximum civil penalty not to exceed the greater of $250,000 or an 
amount that is twice the amount of the transaction that is the basis 
of the violation with respect to which the penalty is imposed.

    (2) A person who willfully commits, willfully attempts to commit, 
or willfully conspires to commit, or aids or abets in the commission of 
a violation of any license, order, regulation, or prohibition may, upon 
conviction, be

[[Page 5510]]

fined not more than $1,000,000, or if a natural person, be imprisoned 
for not more than 20 years, or both.
    (b) Adjustments to penalty amounts. (1) The civil penalties 
provided in IEEPA are subject to adjustment pursuant to the Federal 
Civil Penalties Inflation Adjustment Act of 1990 (Pub. L. 101-410, as 
amended, 28 U.S.C. 2461 note).
    (2) The criminal penalties provided in IEEPA are subject to 
adjustment pursuant to 18 U.S.C. 3571.
    (c) Attention is also directed to 18 U.S.C. 1001, which provides 
that whoever, in any matter within the jurisdiction of the executive, 
legislative, or judicial branch of the Government of the United States, 
knowingly and willfully falsifies, conceals, or covers up by any trick, 
scheme, or device a material fact; makes any materially false, 
fictitious, or fraudulent statement or representation; or makes or uses 
any false writing or document knowing the same to contain any 
materially false, fictitious, or fraudulent statement or entry shall be 
fined under title 18, United States Code, imprisoned, or both.
    (d) Violations of this part may also be subject to relevant 
provisions of other applicable laws.


Sec.  548.702  Pre-Penalty Notice; settlement.

    (a) When required. If the Office of Foreign Assets Control has 
reason to believe that there has occurred a violation of any provision 
of this part or a violation of the provisions of any license, ruling, 
regulation, order, direction, or instruction issued by or pursuant to 
the direction or authorization of the Secretary of the Treasury 
pursuant to this part or otherwise under IEEPA and determines that a 
civil monetary penalty is warranted, the Office of Foreign Assets 
Control will issue a Pre-Penalty Notice informing the alleged violator 
of the agency's intent to impose a monetary penalty. A Pre-Penalty 
Notice shall be in writing. The Pre-Penalty Notice may be issued 
whether or not another agency has taken any action with respect to the 
matter. For a description of the contents of a Pre-Penalty Notice, see 
Appendix A to part 501 of this chapter.
    (b)(1) Right to respond. An alleged violator has the right to 
respond to a Pre-Penalty Notice by making a written presentation to the 
Office of Foreign Assets Control. For a description of the information 
that should be included in such a response, see Appendix A to part 501 
of this chapter.
    (2) Deadline for response. A response to a Pre-Penalty Notice must 
be made within the applicable 30-day period set forth in this 
paragraph. The failure to submit a response within the applicable time 
period set forth in this paragraph shall be deemed to be a waiver of 
the right to respond.
    (i) Computation of time for response. A response to a Pre-Penalty 
Notice must be postmarked or date-stamped by the U.S. Postal Service 
(or foreign postal service, if mailed abroad) or courier service 
provider (if transmitted to the Office of Foreign Assets Control by 
courier) on or before the 30th day after the postmark date on the 
envelope in which the Pre-Penalty Notice was mailed. If the Pre-Penalty 
Notice was personally delivered by a non-U.S. Postal Service agent 
authorized by the Office of Foreign Assets Control, a response must be 
postmarked or date-stamped on or before the 30th day after the date of 
delivery.
    (ii) Extensions of time for response. If a due date falls on a 
federal holiday or weekend, that due date is extended to include the 
following business day. Any other extensions of time will be granted, 
at the discretion of the Office of Foreign Assets Control, only upon 
specific request to the Office of Foreign Assets Control.
    (3) Form and method of response. A response to a Pre-Penalty Notice 
need not be in any particular form, but it must be typewritten and 
signed by the alleged violator or a representative thereof, must 
contain information sufficient to indicate that it is in response to 
the Pre-Penalty Notice, and must include the Office of Foreign Assets 
Control identification number listed on the Pre-Penalty Notice. A copy 
of the written response may be sent by facsimile, but the original also 
must be sent to the Office of Foreign Assets Control Civil Penalties 
Division by mail or courier and must be postmarked or date-stamped in 
accordance with paragraph (b)(2) of this section.
    (c) Settlement. Settlement discussion may be initiated by the 
Office of Foreign Assets Control, the alleged violator, or the alleged 
violator's authorized representative. For a description of practices 
with respect to settlement, see Appendix A to part 501 of this chapter.
    (d) Guidelines. Guidelines for the imposition or settlement of 
civil penalties by the Office of Foreign Assets Control are contained 
in Appendix A to part 501 of this chapter.
    (e) Representation. A representative of the alleged violator may 
act on behalf of the alleged violator, but any oral communication with 
the Office of Foreign Assets Control prior to a written submission 
regarding the specific allegations contained in the Pre-Penalty Notice 
must be preceded by a written letter of representation, unless the Pre-
Penalty Notice was served upon the alleged violator in care of the 
representative.


Sec.  548.703  Penalty imposition.

    If, after considering any written response to the Pre-Penalty 
Notice and any relevant facts, the Office of Foreign Assets Control 
determines that there was a violation by the alleged violator named in 
the Pre-Penalty Notice and that a civil monetary penalty is 
appropriate, the Office of Foreign Assets Control may issue a Penalty 
Notice to the violator containing a determination of the violation and 
the imposition of the monetary penalty. For additional details 
concerning issuance of a Penalty Notice, see Appendix A to part 501 of 
this chapter. The issuance of the Penalty Notice shall constitute final 
agency action. The violator has the right to seek judicial review of 
that final agency action in federal district court.


Sec.  548.704  Administrative collection; referral to United States 
Department of Justice.

    In the event that the violator does not pay the penalty imposed 
pursuant to this part or make payment arrangements acceptable to the 
Office of Foreign Assets Control, the matter may be referred for 
administrative collection measures by the Department of the Treasury or 
to the United States Department of Justice for appropriate action to 
recover the penalty in a civil suit in a Federal district court.
