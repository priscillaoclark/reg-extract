SECURITIES AND EXCHANGE COMMISSION

 
Proposed Collection; Comment Request

Upon Written Request, Copies Available From: Securities and Exchange 
Commission, Office of Investor Education and Advocacy, Washington, DC 
20549-0213.

Extension:
    Form 6-K; OMB Control No. 3235-0116; SEC File No. 270-107.

    Notice is hereby given that, pursuant to the Paperwork Reduction 
Act of 1995 (44 U.S.C. 3501 et seq.), the Securities and Exchange 
Commission (``Commission'') is soliciting comments on the collection of 
information summarized below. The Commission plans to submit this 
existing collection of information to the Office of Management and 
Budget for extension and approval.
    Form 6-K (17 CFR 249.306) is a disclosure document under the 
Securities Exchange Act of 1934 (15 U.S.C. 78a et seq.) that must be 
filed by a foreign private issuer to report material information 
promptly after the occurrence of specified or other

[[Page 63216]]

important corporate events that are disclosed in the foreign private 
issuer's home country. The purpose of Form 6-K is to ensure that U.S. 
investors have access to the same information that foreign investors do 
when making investment decisions. Form 6-K takes approximately 8.7 
hours per response and is filed by approximately 12,022 issuers 
annually. We estimate that 75% of the 8.7 hours per response (6.525 
hours) is prepared by the issuer for a total annual reporting burden of 
78,444 hours (6.525 hours per response x 12,022 responses).
    Written comments are invited on: (a) Whether this collection of 
information is necessary for the proper performance of the functions of 
the agency, including whether the information will have practical 
utility; (b) the accuracy of the agency's estimate of the burden 
imposed by the collection of information; (c) ways to enhance the 
quality, utility, and clarity of the information collected; and (d) 
ways to minimize the burden of the collection of information on 
respondents, including through the use of automated collection 
techniques or other forms of information technology. Consideration will 
be given to comments and suggestions submitted in writing within 60 
days of this publication.
    Please direct your written comments to Jeffrey Heslop, Acting 
Director/CIO, Securities and Exchange Commission, C/O Remi Pavlik-
Simon, 6432 General Green Way, Alexandria, Virginia 22312; or send an 
e-mail to: <A HREF="mailto:PRA_Mailbox@sec.gov">PRA_Mailbox@sec.gov</A>.

    Dated: October 6, 2010.
Florence E. Harmon,
Deputy Secretary.
