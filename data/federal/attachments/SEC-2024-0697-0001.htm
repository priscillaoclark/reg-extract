SECURITIES AND EXCHANGE COMMISSION

[SEC File No. 270-205, OMB Control No. 3235-0194]


Proposed Collection; Comment Request; Extension: Rule 24b-1

Upon Written Request, Copies Available From: Securities and Exchange 
Commission, Office of FOIA Services, 100 F Street NE, Washington, DC 
20549-2736

    Notice is hereby given that pursuant to the Paperwork Reduction Act 
of 1995 (``PRA'') (44 U.S.C. 3501 et seq.), the Securities and Exchange 
Commission (``Commission'') is soliciting comments on the existing 
collection of information provided for in Rule 24b-1 (17 CFR 240.24b-1) 
under the Securities

[[Page 45933]]

Exchange Act of 1934 (15 U.S.C. 78a et seq.). The Commission plans to 
submit this existing collection of information to the Office of 
Management and Budget (``OMB'') for extension and approval.
    Rule 24b-1 requires a national securities exchange to keep and make 
available for public inspection a copy of its registration statement 
and exhibits filed with the Commission, including any amendments 
thereto.
    There are 24 national securities exchanges that spend approximately 
one-half hour each per year complying with this rule, for an aggregate 
total time burden of approximately 12 hours per year. The staff 
estimates that the average cost per respondent is approximately $82.45 
per year ($17.67 for copying plus $64.78 for storage), resulting in a 
total cost burden for all respondents of approximately $1,979 per year.
    Written comments are invited on: (a) whether the proposed 
collection of information is necessary for the proper performance of 
the functions of the Commission, including whether the information 
shall have practical utility; (b) the accuracy of the Commission's 
estimates of the burden of the proposed collection of information; (c) 
ways to enhance the quality, utility, and clarity of the information 
collected; and (d) ways to minimize the burden of the collection of 
information on respondents, including through the use of automated 
collection techniques or other forms of information technology. 
Consideration will be given to comments and suggestions submitted by 
July 23, 2024.
    An agency may not conduct or sponsor, and a person is not required 
to respond to, a collection of information under the PRA unless it 
displays a currently valid OMB control number.
    Please direct your written comments to: David Bottom, Director/
Chief Information Officer, Securities and Exchange Commission, c/o John 
Pezzullo, 100 F Street NE, Washington, DC 20549, or send an email to:

Sherry R. Haywood,
Assistant Secretary.
