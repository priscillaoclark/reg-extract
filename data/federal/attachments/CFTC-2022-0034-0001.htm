SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION: 
    Title: Swap Data Recordkeeping and Reporting Requirements: 
Reenactment and Transition Swaps (OMB Control No. 3038-0089). This is a 
request for an extension of a currently approved information 
collection.
    Abstract: Sections 4r(a)(2)(A) and 2(h)(5) of the Commodity 
Exchange Act requires the reporting of pre-enactment and transition 
swaps. Regulations 46.2, 46.3, and 46.11 establish reporting 
requirements that are mandated by 4r and 2(h) and, thus, are necessary 
to implement the objectives of 4r and 2(h). Regulation 46.2 establishes 
swap counterparties' recordkeeping requirements for pre-enactment and 
transition swaps. Regulation 46.3 establishes reporting requirements 
for uncleared pre-enactment or transition swaps in existence on or 
after April 25, 2011, and throughout the existence of the swap.\2\ 
Regulation 46.11 addresses the reporting of errors and omission in 
previously reported data. The data required to be compiled and 
maintained pursuant to the Part 46 regulations would be used by the 
Commission and other financial regulators for fulfillment of various 
regulatory mandates. The collection of information is needed to ensure 
that the CFTC and other regulators have access to data regarding pre-
enactment and transition swaps, as required by the Commodity Exchange 
Act as amended by the Dodd-Frank Wall Street Reform and Consumer 
Protection Act (``Dodd-Frank Act'').
---------------------------------------------------------------------------

    \2\ See 17 CFR part 46.1 (defining ``pre-enactment swap'' as any 
swap entered into prior to enactment of the Dodd-Frank Act of 2010 
(July 21, 2010), the terms of which have not expired as of the date 
of enactment of that Act, and ``transition swap'' as any swap 
entered into on or after the enactment of the Dodd-Frank Act of 2010 
(July 21, 2010) and prior to the applicable compliance date on which 
a registered entity or swap counterparty subject to the jurisdiction 
of the Commission is required to commence full compliance with all 
provisions of part 46).
---------------------------------------------------------------------------

    An agency may not conduct or sponsor, and a person is not required 
to respond to, a collection of information unless it displays a 
currently valid OMB control number. On April 26, 2022, the Commission 
published in the Federal Register notice of the proposed extension of 
this information collection and provided 60 days for public comment on 
the proposed extension, 87 FR 24534 (``60-Day Notice''). The Commission 
did not receive any relevant comments on the 60-Day Notice.
    Burden Statement: The Commission is revising its estimate of the 
burden for this collection to reflect the current number of respondents 
and estimated burden hours. The respondent burden for this collection 
is estimated to be as follows:
    <bullet> Recordkeeping:
    Estimated Number of Respondents: 30,108.
    Estimated Average Burden Hours per Respondent: 69.5 hours.
    Estimated Total Annual Burden Hours: 13,506 hours.
    Frequency of Collection: 1.
    <bullet> Reporting:
    Estimated Number of Respondents: 608.
    Estimated Average Burden Hours per Respondent: 5.64 hours.
    Estimated Total Annual Burden Hours: 860 hours.
    Frequency of Collection: Daily.
    <bullet> Total Annual Burden for the Collection: 14,366 hours.
    There are no capital costs or operating and maintenance costs 
associated with this collection.

(Authority: 44 U.S.C. 3501 et seq.)

    Dated: June 27, 2022.
Robert Sidman,
Deputy Secretary of the Commission.
