I. Self-Regulatory Organization's Statement of the Terms of Substance 
of the Proposed Rule Change

    NASDAQ is filing with the Securities and Exchange Commission 
(``SEC'' or ``Commission'') a proposal that clarifies when the NASDAQ 
Options Market (``NOM'' or ``Exchange'') intends to implement a recent 
filing that adopted a definition of ``Professional'' on the Exchange 
and required that all Professional orders be appropriately marked (the 
``NOM Professional filing'').
    The text of the proposed rule change is available from NASDAQ's Web 
site at <A HREF="http://frwebgate.access.gpo.gov/cgi-bin/leaving.cgi?from=leavingFR.html&log=linklog&to=http://nasdaq.cchwallstreet.com/Filings/">http://nasdaq.cchwallstreet.com/Filings/</A>, at NASDAQ's principal 
office, and at the Commission's Public Reference Room.

II. Self-Regulatory Organization's Statement of the Purpose of, and 
Statutory Basis for, the Proposed Rule Change

    In its filing with the Commission, NASDAQ included statements 
concerning the purpose of and basis for the proposed rule change and 
discussed

[[Page 66812]]

any comments it received on the proposed rule change. The text of these 
statements may be examined at the places specified in Item IV below. 
NASDAQ has prepared summaries, set forth in sections A, B, and C below, 
of the most significant aspects of such statements.

A. Self-Regulatory Organization's Statement of the Purpose of, and 
Statutory Basis for, the Proposed Rule Change

1. Purpose
    The purpose of this filing is to clarify when the Exchange intends 
to implement the recent NOM Professional filing that amended Chapter I, 
Section 1 (Definitions) to adopt a definition of ``Professional'' on 
the Exchange and require that all Professional orders be appropriately 
marked by Exchange Participants or members.
    In the NOM Professional filing, the Exchange indicated that it 
intended to notify its Participants (members) via an Options Trading 
Alert (``OTA'') or Options Regulatory Alert (``ORA'') that the proposal 
would be implemented on the first trading day of the month after 
approval of the proposal, which would be November 1, 2010.\3\ The 
Exchange has heard from Participants that would be responsible for 
appropriately marking Professional orders that the November 1 
implementation date is too short in light of internal technological 
requirements. As a result, the Exchange is proposing to clarify that it 
intends to implement the NOM Professional filing on the first trading 
day of December 2010, and will so notify its Participants via an OTA or 
ORA.
---------------------------------------------------------------------------

    \3\ See Securities Exchange Act Release No. 62724 (August 16, 
2010), 75 FR 51509 (August 20, 2010) (SR-NASDAQ-2010-099) (notice of 
filing). See also Securities Exchange Act Release Nos. 63028 
(October 1, 2010), 75 FR 62443 (October 8, 2010) (SR-NASDAQ-2010-
099) (approval order).
---------------------------------------------------------------------------

2. Statutory Basis
    Nasdaq believes that the proposed rule change is consistent with 
the provisions of Section 6 of the Act,\4\ in general, and with Section 
6(b)(5) of the Act,\5\ in particular, in that the proposal is designed 
to prevent fraudulent and manipulative acts and practices, to promote 
just and equitable principles of trade, to foster cooperation and 
coordination with persons engaged in regulating, clearing, settling, 
processing information with respect to, and facilitating transactions 
in securities, to remove impediments to and perfect the mechanism of a 
free and open market and a national market system, and, in general, to 
protect investors and the public interest. The proposed rule change 
proposes to clarify for Participants the implementation date of a 
recently-approved Professional designation filing.

    \5\ 15 U.S.C. 78f(b)(5).
---------------------------------------------------------------------------

B. Self-Regulatory Organization's Statement on Burden on Competition

    NASDAQ does not believe that the proposed rule change will result 
in any burden on competition that is not necessary or appropriate in 
furtherance of the purposes of the Act.

C. Self-Regulatory Organization's Statement on Comments on the Proposed 
Rule Change Received From Members, Participants, or Others

    Written comments were neither solicited nor received.

III. Date of Effectiveness of the Proposed Rule Change and Timing for 
Commission Action

    Pursuant to Section 19(b)(3)(A) of the Act \6\ and Rule 19b-4(f)(3) 
thereunder,\7\ Nasdaq has designated this proposal as one that is 
concerned solely with the administration of the self-regulatory 
organization. Accordingly, Nasdaq believes that its proposal should 
become immediately effective.

---------------------------------------------------------------------------

    At any time within 60 days of the filing of the proposed rule 
change, the Commission summarily may temporarily suspend such rule 
change if it appears to the Commission that such action is: (i) 
Necessary or appropriate in the public interest; (ii) for the 
protection of investors; or (iii) otherwise in furtherance of the 
purposes of the Act. If the Commission takes such action, the 
Commission shall institute proceedings to determine whether the 
proposed rule should be approved or disapproved.
