SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION: 
    Title: Part 150, Position Limits, (OMB Control No. 3038-0013). This 
is a request for extension of a currently approved information 
collection.
    Abstract: Commodity Exchange Act (``CEA'') section 4a directs the 
Commission to establish limits on speculative positions, as the 
Commission determines to be necessary, to prevent the harms caused by 
excessive speculation. This Position Limits collection of information 
(OMB Control No. 3038-0013) includes collections of information 
required under both the Final Rule and the Aggregation Rule (as each 
Rule is defined below).
    In 2021, the Commission issued a final rule on position limits that 
implemented CEA section 4a and established the Commission's new 
position limits regime found in part 150 of the Commission's 
Regulations (``Final Rule'').\2\ The Final Rule, among other things, 
included: new and amended Federal spot-month limits for the 25 core 
referenced futures contracts; (2) amended Federal non-spot limits for 
the nine legacy agricultural contracts subject to existing Federal 
position limits; (3) amended rules governing exchange-set limit levels 
and grants of exemptions therefrom; (4) an amended process for 
requesting certain spread exemptions and non-enumerated bona fide hedge 
recognitions for purposes of Federal position limits directly from the 
Commission; (5) a new streamlined process for recognizing non-
enumerated bona fide hedge positions from Federal limit requirements; 
and (6) amendments to part 19 of the Commission's Regulations and 
related provisions that eliminated certain reporting obligations that 
require traders to submit a Form 204 and Parts I and II of Form 304.
---------------------------------------------------------------------------

    \2\ See ``Position Limits for Derivatives,'' 86 FR 3236 (Jan. 
24, 2021).
---------------------------------------------------------------------------

    Separately, in 2016 the Commission issued a final rule amending 
Commission Regulation 150.4, which sets forth requirements regarding 
the aggregation of positions subject to federal position limits (the 
``Aggregation Rule'').\3\ Among other things, Regulation 150.4 includes 
standards for the aggregation of accounts and procedures for seeking an 
exemption from position aggregation requirements under the Commission's 
federal position limits.
---------------------------------------------------------------------------

    \3\ See ``Aggregation of Positions,'' 81 FR 91454 (Dec. 16, 
2016). The position aggregation requirements set forth in Regulation 
150.4 are the subject of No-Action Letter 22-09 and have been the 
subject of similar no-action letters since the rule's effective 
date. As such, as of the date of this notice, market participants do 
not submit the reports set forth in Regulation 150.4. Accordingly, 
all collections of information and related burden estimates under 
Regulation 150.4 are hypothetical.
---------------------------------------------------------------------------

    An agency may not conduct or sponsor, and a person is not required 
to respond to, a collection of information unless it displays a 
currently valid OMB control number.\4\ On January 19, 2023, the 
Commission published in the Federal Register notice of the proposed 
extension of this information collection and provided 60 days for 
public comment on the proposed extension, 88 FR 3395 (``60-Day 
Notice''). The Commission did not receive any relevant comments on the 
60-Day Notice.
---------------------------------------------------------------------------

    \4\ 44 U.S.C. 3512, 5 CFR 1320.5(b)(2)(i) and 1320.8 (b)(3)(vi).
---------------------------------------------------------------------------

    Burden Statement: The Commission anticipates that there will 
continue to be approximately 776 respondents and the hourly burden will 
remain the same as provided in the 60-Day Notice. The respondent burden 
for this collection is estimated to be as follows:
    Estimated number of respondents: 776.
    Estimated average burden hours per respondent: 15.14 hours.
    Estimated total annual burden hours for all respondents: 11,748 
hours.
    Frequency of Collection: As needed.
    There are no capital costs or operating and maintenance costs 
associated with this collection.

(Authority: 44 U.S.C. 3501 et seq.)


    Dated: March 22, 2023.
Robert Sidman,
Deputy Secretary of the Commission.
