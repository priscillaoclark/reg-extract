SECURITIES AND EXCHANGE COMMISSION

[SEC File No. 270-199, OMB Control No. 3235-0199]


Proposed Collection; Comment Request; Extension: Rule 17a-5(c)

Upon Written Request, Copies Available From: Securities and Exchange 
Commission, Office of FOIA Services, 100 F Street NE, Washington, DC 
20549-2736

    Notice is hereby given that pursuant to the Paperwork Reduction Act 
of 1995 (``PRA'') (44 U.S.C. 3501 et seq.), the Securities and Exchange 
Commission

[[Page 68226]]

(``Commission'') is soliciting comments on the existing collection of 
information provided for in Rule 17a-5(c) (17 CFR 240.17a-5(c)), under 
the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 (15 U.S.C. 78a et seq.). The 
Commission plans to submit this existing collection of information to 
the Office of Management and Budget (``OMB'') for extension and 
approval.
    Rule 17a-5(c) generally requires broker-dealers who carry customer 
accounts to provide statements of the broker-dealer's financial 
condition to their customers. Paragraph (c)(5) of Rule 17a-5 provides a 
conditional exemption from this requirement. A broker-dealer that 
elects to take advantage of the exemption must publish its statements 
on its website in a prescribed manner, and must maintain a toll-free 
number that customers can call to request a copy of the statements.
    The purpose of the Rule is to ensure that customers of broker-
dealers are provided with information concerning the financial 
condition of the firm that may be holding the customers' cash and 
securities. The Commission, when adopting the Rule in 1972, stated that 
the goal was to ``directly'' send a customer essential information so 
that the customer could ``judge whether his broker or dealer is 
financially sound.'' The Commission adopted the Rule in response to the 
failure of several broker-dealers holding customer funds and securities 
in the period between 1968 and 1971.
    The Commission estimates that approximately 153 broker-dealer 
respondents carrying approximately 272 million public customer accounts 
incur a burden of approximately 327,444 hours per year to comply with 
the Rule.
    Written comments are invited on: (a) whether the proposed 
collection of information is necessary for the proper performance of 
the functions of the Commission, including whether the information 
shall have practical utility; (b) the accuracy of the Commission's 
estimates of the burden of the proposed collection of information; (c) 
ways to enhance the quality, utility, and clarity of the information 
collected; and (d) ways to minimize the burden of the collection of 
information on respondents, including through the use of automated 
collection techniques or other forms of information technology. 
Consideration will be given to comments and suggestions submitted by 
October 22, 2024.
    An agency may not conduct or sponsor, and a person is not required 
to respond to, a collection of information under the PRA unless it 
displays a currently valid OMB control number.
    Please direct your written comments to: Austin Gerig, Director/
Chief Data Officer, Securities and Exchange Commission, c/o Oluwaseun 
Ajayi, 100 F Street NE, Washington, DC 20549, or send an email to:

Secretary.
