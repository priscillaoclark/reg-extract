SECURITIES AND EXCHANGE COMMISSION

Submission for OMB Review; Comment Request; Form ABS-EE

Upon Written Request Copies Available From: Securities and Exchange 
Commission, Office of FOIA Services, 100 F Street NE, Washington, DC 
20549-2736

    Notice is hereby given that, pursuant to the Paperwork Reduction 
Act of 1995 (44 U.S.C. 3501 et seq.), the Securities and Exchange 
Commission (``Commission'') has submitted to the Office of Management 
and Budget this request for extension of the previously approved 
collection of information discussed below.
    Form ABS-EE (17 CFR 249.1401) is filed by asset-backed issuers to 
provide asset-level information for registered offerings of asset-
backed securities at the time of securitization and on an ongoing basis 
required by Item 1111(h) of Regulation AB (17 CFR 229.1111(h)). The 
purpose of the information collected on Form ABS-EE is to implement the 
disclosure requirements

[[Page 53673]]

of Section 7(c) of the Securities Act of 1933 (15 U.S.C. 77g(c)) to 
provide information regarding the use of representations and warranties 
in the asset-backed securities markets. Form ABS-EE takes approximately 
50.87152 hours per response to prepare and is filed by 5,463 
securitizers annually. We estimate that 25% of the approximately 
50.87152 hours per response (12.71788 hours) is prepared by the 
securitizers internally for a total annual reporting burden of 69,478 
hours (12.71788 hours per response x 5,463 responses).
    An agency may not conduct or sponsor, and a person is not required 
to respond to, a collection of information unless it displays a 
currently valid control number.
    The public may view background documentation for this information 
collection at the following website: <a href="http://www.reginfo.gov">www.reginfo.gov</a>. Find this 
particular information collection by selecting ``Currently under 30-day 
Review--Open for Public Comments'' or by using the search function. 
Written comments and recommendations for the proposed information 
collection should be sent within 30 days of publication of this notice 
by July 29, 2024 to (i) <a href="http://www.reginfo.gov/public/do/PRAMain">www.reginfo.gov/public/do/PRAMain</a> and (ii)
