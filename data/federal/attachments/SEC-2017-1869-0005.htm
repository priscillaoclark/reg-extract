SECURITIES AND EXCHANGE COMMISSION

[SEC File No. 270-173, OMB Control No. 3235-0178]


Submission for OMB Review; Comment Request; Extension: Rule 31a-1

Upon Written Request, Copies Available From: Securities and Exchange 
Commission, Office of FOIA Services, 100 F Street NE, Washington, DC 
20549-2736

    Notice is hereby given that, pursuant to the Paperwork Reduction 
Act of 1995 (44 U.S.C. 3501-3520), the Securities and Exchange 
Commission (``Commission'') has submitted to the Office of Management 
and Budget a request for extension of the previously approved 
collection of information discussed below.
    Rule 31a-1 (17 CFR 270.31a-1) under the Investment Company Act of 
1940 (the ``Act'') (15 U.S.C. 80a) is entitled ``Records to be 
maintained by registered investment companies, certain majority-owned 
subsidiaries thereof, and other persons having transactions with 
registered investment companies.'' Rule 31a-1 requires registered 
investment companies (``funds''), and every underwriter, broker, 
dealer, or investment adviser that is a majority-owned subsidiary of a 
fund, to maintain and keep current accounts, books, and other documents 
which constitute the record forming the basis for financial statements 
required to be filed pursuant to section 31 of the Act (15 U.S.C. 80a-
30) and of the auditor's certificates relating thereto. The rule lists 
specific records to be maintained by funds. The rule also requires 
certain underwriters, brokers, dealers, depositors, and investment 
advisers to maintain the records that they are required to maintain 
under federal securities laws. The Commission periodically inspects the 
operations of funds to insure their compliance with the provisions of 
the Act and the rules thereunder. The books and records required to be 
maintained by rule 31a-1 constitute a major focus of the Commission's 
inspection program.
    There are approximately 2,766 investment companies registered with 
the Commission, all of which are required to comply with rule 31a-1. 
For purposes of determining the burden imposed by rule 31a-1, the 
Commission staff estimates that each fund is divided into approximately 
four series, on average, and that each series is required to comply 
with the recordkeeping requirements of rule 31a-1. Based on

[[Page 77647]]

conversations with fund representatives, it is estimated that rule 31a-
1 imposes an average burden of approximately 1,750 hours annually per 
series for a total of 7,000 annual hours per fund. The estimated total 
annual burden for all 2,766 funds subject to the rule therefore is 
approximately 19,362,000 hours. Based on conversations with fund 
representatives, however, the Commission staff estimates that even 
absent the requirements of rule 31a-1, 90 percent of the records 
created pursuant to the rule are the type that generally would be 
created as a matter of normal business practice and to prepare 
financial statements. Thus, the Commission staff estimates that the 
total annual burden associated with rule 31a-1 is 1,936,200 hours.
    The estimate of average burden hours is made solely for the 
purposes of the Paperwork Reduction Act, and is not derived from a 
comprehensive or even a representative survey or study. The collection 
of information required by rule 31a-1 is mandatory. Responses will not 
be kept confidential. The records required by rule 31a-1 are required 
to be preserved pursuant to rule 31a-2 under the Investment Company Act 
(17 CFR 270.31a-2). Rule 31a-2 requires that certain of these records 
be preserved permanently, and that others be preserved six years from 
the end of the fiscal year in which any transaction occurred. In both 
cases, the records should be kept in an easily accessible place for the 
first two years. An agency may not conduct or sponsor, and a person is 
not required to respond to, a collection of information unless it 
displays a currently valid OMB control number.
    The public may view background documentation for this information 
collection at the following website: <a href="http://www.reginfo.gov">www.reginfo.gov</a>. Find this 
particular information collection by selecting ``Currently under 30-day 
Review--Open for Public Comments'' or by using the search function.

by December 13, 2023 to (i) <a href="/cdn-cgi/l/email-protection#ce838c96e081838ce081879c8fe09d8b8d91aaabbda591a1a8a8a7adabbc8ea1a3ace0aba1bee0a9a1b8"><span class="__cf_email__" data-cfemail="abe6e9f385e4e6e985e4e2f9ea85f8eee8f4cfced8c0f4c4cdcdc2c8ced9ebc4c6c985cec4db85ccc4dd">[email&#160;protected]</span></a>
