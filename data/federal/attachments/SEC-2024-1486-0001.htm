Self-Regulatory Organizations; New York Stock Exchange LLC; 
Notice of Filing and Immediate Effectiveness of Proposed Rule Change To 
Harmonize NYSE Rule 3110

October 15, 2024.
    Pursuant to Section 19(b)(1) \1\ of the Securities Exchange Act of 
1934 (``Act'') \2\ and Rule 19b-4 thereunder,\3\ notice is hereby given 
that on October 3, 2024, New York Stock Exchange LLC (``NYSE'' or the 
``Exchange'') filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission (the 
``Commission'') the proposed rule change as described in Items I and II 
below, which Items have been prepared by the self-regulatory 
organization. The Commission is publishing this notice to solicit 
comments on the proposed rule change from interested persons.

I. Self-Regulatory Organization's Statement of the Terms of Substance 
of the Proposed Rule Change

    The Exchange proposes to harmonize NYSE Rule 3110 (Supervision) 
with certain changes by the Financial Industry Regulatory Authority, 
Inc. (``FINRA'') to FINRA Rule 3110 to permit eligible member 
organizations to participate in FINRA's remote inspections program 
(``FINRA Pilot Program'') and to adopt FINRA's Residential Supervisory 
Location (``RSL'') classification. The proposed rule change is 
available on the Exchange's website at <a href="http://www.nyse.com">www.nyse.com</a>, at the principal 
office of the Exchange, and at the Commission's Public Reference Room.

II. Self-Regulatory Organization's Statement of the Purpose of, and 
Statutory Basis for, the Proposed Rule Change

    In its filing with the Commission, the self-regulatory organization 
included statements concerning the purpose of, and basis for, the 
proposed rule change and discussed any comments it received on the 
proposed rule change. The text of those statements may be examined at 
the places specified in Item IV below. The Exchange has prepared 
summaries, set forth in sections A, B, and C below, of the most 
significant parts of such statements.

A. Self-Regulatory Organization's Statement of the Purpose of, and the 
Statutory Basis for, the Proposed Rule Change

1. Purpose
    The Exchange proposes to harmonize NYSE Rule 3110 (Supervision) 
with certain changes by FINRA to FINRA Rule 3110 to permit eligible 
member organizations to participate in the FINRA Pilot Program and to 
adopt FINRA's RSL classification. The proposed rule change would 
harmonize the Exchange's office and other location inspection rules 
with those of FINRA and thus promote uniform inspection standards 
across the securities industry. Additionally, because proposed 
Supplementary Material .18 to NYSE Rule 3110 and proposed Supplementary 
Material .19 to NYSE Rule 3110 would be substantially similar to FINRA 
Rule 3110.18 and FINRA Rule 3110.19, respectively, this rule change 
enables NYSE Rule 3110 to continue to be incorporated into the 
agreement between NYSE and FINRA to allocate regulatory responsibility 
for common rules (the ``17d-2 Agreement'').\4\
---------------------------------------------------------------------------

    \4\ See Securities Exchange Act Release No. 60409 (July 30, 
2009), 74 FR 39353, (August 6, 2009) (File No. 4-587). The 17d-2 
Agreement includes a certification by NYSE that states that the 
requirements contained in certain Exchange rules are identical to, 
or substantially similar to, certain FINRA rules that have been 
identified as comparable.
---------------------------------------------------------------------------

Background and Proposed Rule Change
    NYSE Rule 3110 is based on FINRA Rule 3110 \5\ and requires member 
organizations to establish and maintain a system to supervise the 
activities of each associated person that is reasonably designed to 
achieve compliance with applicable securities laws and regulations, and 
with applicable Exchange rules, and sets forth the minimum requirements 
for such supervisory system.\6\ Under NYSE Rule 3110, final 
responsibility for proper supervision rests with the member 
organization.
---------------------------------------------------------------------------

    \5\ See Securities Exchange Act Release No. 73554 (November 6, 
2014), 79 FR 67508 (November 13, 2014) (SR-NYSE-2014-56).
    \6\ See NYSE Rule 3110(a).
---------------------------------------------------------------------------

    As part of an overall supervisory system, member organizations must 
conduct inspections of each of their offices or locations on a 
designated frequency depending on the classification of the location or 
the nature of the activities that take place: an office of supervisory 
jurisdiction (``OSJ'') and supervisory branch offices must be inspected 
at least annually; \7\ non-supervisory branch offices, at least every 
three years; \8\ and non-branch locations on a periodic schedule, 
presumed to be at least every three years.\9\ Moreover, member 
organizations must retain a written record of the date upon which each 
review and inspection occurred, reduce a location's inspection to a 
written report and keep each inspection report on file either for a 
minimum of three years or, if the location's inspection schedule is 
longer than three years, until the next inspection report has been 
written.\10\ If applicable to the location being inspected, the 
inspection report must include the testing and verification of the 
member organization's policies and procedures, including supervisory 
policies and procedures, in specified areas.\11\ Finally, the rule 
requires a member to ensure that the person conducting the inspection 
is not an associated person assigned to the location or is not directly 
or indirectly supervised by, or otherwise reporting to, an associated 
person assigned to the location.\12\ The factors governing what 
constitutes a reasonable review are set out in NYSE Rule 3110.12 
(Standards for Reasonable Review).
---------------------------------------------------------------------------

    \7\ See NYSE Rule 3110(c)(1)(A).
    \8\ See NYSE Rule 3110(c)(1)(B).
    \9\ See NYSE Rules 3110(c)(1)(C) and 3110.13 (General 
Presumption of Three-Year Limit for Periodic Inspection Schedules).
    \10\ See NYSE Rule 3110(c)(2).
    \11\ See NYSE Rule 3110(c)(2)(A).
    \12\ See NYSE Rule 3110(c)(3). Rule 3110(c)(3) provides a 
limited exception from this requirement if a firm determines 
compliance is not possible either because of the firm's size or its 
business model. See Rule 3110.14 (Exception to Persons Prohibited 
from Conducting Inspections).
---------------------------------------------------------------------------

    In 2023, recognizing how operations and business models within the 
financial services industry have evolved with changes in technology 
that were accelerated by the COVID-19 pandemic, including in particular 
the implementation by a large number of firms of a hybrid work 
environment during the public health crisis, FINRA adopted two 
amendments to FINRA Rule 3110. First, FINRA established a voluntary, 
three-year remote inspections pilot program to allow eligible members 
to fulfill their FINRA Rule 3110(c)(1) inspection obligation of 
qualified branch offices, including OSJs and non-branch locations 
remotely, without an on-site visit to such offices or locations subject 
to certain conditions and criteria.\13\ The FINRA Pilot Program is

[[Page 84222]]

set forth in Supplementary Material .18 of FINRA Rule 3110. Second, 
FINRA adopted new Supplementary Material .19 to FINRA Rule 3110 that 
treats an associated person's private residence where specified 
supervisory activities are conducted, subject to certain safeguards and 
limitations, as a non-branch location (i.e., unregistered office). As a 
non-branch location under FINRA Rule 3110(c), the RSL would be subject 
to inspections on a regular periodic schedule instead of the annual 
inspection currently required for every OSJ and supervisory branch 
offices.\14\
---------------------------------------------------------------------------

    \13\ See Securities Exchange Act Release No. 98982 (November 17, 
2023), 88 FR 82464 (November 24, 2023) (File No. SR-FINRA-2023-007) 
(Order Approving a Proposed Rule Change To Adopt Supplementary 
Material .18 (Remote Inspections Pilot Program) Under FINRA Rule 
3110 (Supervision)). Pursuant to FINRA Rule 3110.18(m), on the 
sunset of Rule 3110.18, if FINRA Rule 3110.18 has not already 
expired by its own terms, FINRA Rule 3110.18 will automatically 
sunset on June 30, 2024.
    \14\ See Securities Exchange Act Release No. 98980 (November 17, 
2023), 88 FR 82447 (November 24, 2023) (File No. SR-FINRA-2023-006) 
(Notice of Filing of Amendment No. 2 and Order Granting Accelerated 
Approval of a Proposed Rule Change, as Modified by Amendment Nos. 1 
and 2, To Adopt Supplementary Material .19 (Residential Supervisory 
Location) Under FINRA Rule 3110 (Supervision)).
---------------------------------------------------------------------------

    The Exchange proposes to incorporate each of these amendments into 
NYSE Rule 3110, as follows.
NYSE Rule 3110, Supplementary Material .18 \15\
---------------------------------------------------------------------------

    \15\ The Exchange would add new Supplementary Material .17 
marked ``Reserved'' in order to maintain consistency with FINRA.
---------------------------------------------------------------------------

    The Exchange proposes, consistent with current FINRA Rule 3110, 
Supplementary Material .18, to adopt new Supplementary Material .18 to 
NYSE Rule 3110 in order to provide eligible member organizations that 
are also FINRA members \16\ with the flexibility to opt into the FINRA 
Pilot Program, consisting of a voluntary, three-year remote inspections 
pilot program to fulfill their office inspection obligations under NYSE 
Rule 3110(c) by conducting inspections of eligible OSJs, branch 
offices, and non-branch locations remotely without an on-site visit to 
such locations, subject to certain conditions and criteria. The 
requirements in connection with the participation in the FINRA Pilot 
Program under proposed Supplementary Material .18 would mirror in all 
material respects the requirements with respect to a FINRA member's 
participation under FINRA rules in the FINRA Pilot Program. Member 
organizations opting into the FINRA Pilot Program would do so pursuant 
to the provisions of proposed Supplementary Material .18 and through 
the mechanisms and processes established by FINRA in connection with 
the FINRA Pilot Program. The proposed rule change also re-orders and 
streamlines some of the provisions of FINRA Rule 3110.18, as described 
below.
---------------------------------------------------------------------------

    \16\ Currently, all NYSE member organizations with one exception 
are also FINRA members.
---------------------------------------------------------------------------

Proposed NYSE Rule 3110.18(a) (Scope)
    Proposed Supplementary Material .18(a) of NYSE Rule 3110 would 
establish the standards by which a member organization that is also a 
FINRA member may participate in the FINRA Pilot Program.
    Proposed subsection (a) would permit member organizations to avail 
themselves of the FINRA Pilot Program for the required inspection of 
OSJs, branch offices and non-branch locations pursuant to, as 
applicable, paragraphs (c)(1)(A), (B) and (C) of NYSE Rule 3110, for a 
period starting on the effective date of the proposed rule filing and 
expiring on June 30, 2027. If FINRA extends the pilot program and the 
proposed Supplementary Material .18 is not amended to allow continued 
participation by member organizations in the FINRA Pilot Program, 
member organizations would not be able to participate in the FINRA 
Pilot Program after the prescribed provisions under the proposed 
Supplementary Material sunset.
    With the exception of conforming and technical changes,\17\ 
proposed NYSE Rule 3110.18(a) is substantially the same as FINRA Rule 
3110.18(a).
---------------------------------------------------------------------------

    \17\ Where the Exchange states herein that only conforming and 
technical changes have been made, the Exchange is referring to 
instances in which it changed FINRA's ``member'' to the Exchange's 
equivalent ``member organization;'' changed cross-references to 
FINRA rules to cross-references to Exchange rules unless there was 
no equivalent NYSE rule; and made other non-substantive technical or 
grammatical changes.
---------------------------------------------------------------------------

Proposed NYSE Rule 3110.18(b) (Risk Assessment)
    Proposed Supplementary Material .18(b) of NYSE Rule 3110 governing 
risk assessment would outline the need for member organizations to 
undertake a risk assessment in order to participate in the FINRA Pilot 
Program.
    Proposed Supplementary Material .18(b)(1) would set forth the 
applicable standard for review and would provide that a member 
organization could elect to conduct the applicable inspection remotely, 
without an on-site visit for an office or location, when such member 
organization reasonably determines that the purposes of the 
Supplementary Material can be accomplished by conducting such required 
inspection remotely. The member organization would be required to 
develop a reasonable risk-based approach to using remote inspections 
and conduct and document a risk assessment for an office or location 
prior to conducting a remote inspection. The risk assessment must 
document the factors considered, including, among other things, the 
factors set forth in current NYSE Rule 3110.12 such as a firm's size, 
organizational structure, scope of business activities, number and 
location of the firm's offices, the nature and complexity of the 
products and services offered by the firm, the volume of business done, 
the number of associated persons assigned to a location, the 
disciplinary history of registered representatives or associated 
persons, and any indicators of irregularities or misconduct (i.e., 
``red flags''), and must take into account any higher-risk activities 
that take place at, or higher-risk associated persons that are assigned 
to, that office or location. Additionally, proposed Supplementary 
Material .18(b)(1) would require a member organization to conduct an 
on-site inspection on the required cycle for such offices or locations 
that are ineligible for remote office inspections because of not having 
met the firm or location level requirements under proposed 
Supplementary Material .18(f) or (g), respectively. Notwithstanding 
proposed Supplementary Material .18, a member organization would remain 
subject to the other requirements of NYSE Rule 3110(c).
    Proposed Supplementary Material .18(b)(2) would address other risk 
assessment factors and would provide that when conducting the risk 
assessment of each office or location in accordance with proposed 
paragraph (b)(1) of the Supplementary Material, a member organization 
must consider, among other things, the following factors with respect 
to an office or location in making its risk assessment for remotely 
inspecting an office or location:
    <bullet> the volume and nature of customer complaints; \18\
---------------------------------------------------------------------------

    \18\ See proposed NYSE Rule 3110.18(b)(2)(A), mirroring FINRA 
Rule 3110.18(b)(2)(A).
---------------------------------------------------------------------------

    <bullet> the volume and nature of outside business activities, 
particularly investment-related; \19\
---------------------------------------------------------------------------

    \19\ See proposed NYSE Rule 3110.18(b)(2)(B), mirroring FINRA 
Rule 3110.18(b)(2)(B).
---------------------------------------------------------------------------

    <bullet> the volume and complexity of products offered; \20\
---------------------------------------------------------------------------

    \20\ See proposed NYSE Rule 3110.18(b)(2)(C), mirroring FINRA 
Rule 3110.18(b)(2)(C).
---------------------------------------------------------------------------

    <bullet> the nature of the customer base, including vulnerable 
adult investors; \21\
---------------------------------------------------------------------------

    \21\ See proposed NYSE Rule 3110.18(b)(2)(D), mirroring FINRA 
Rule 3110.18(b)(2)(D).
---------------------------------------------------------------------------

    <bullet> whether associated persons are subject to heightened 
supervision; \22\
---------------------------------------------------------------------------

    \22\ See proposed NYSE Rule 3110.18(b)(2)(E), mirroring FINRA 
Rule 3110.18(b)(2)(E).

---------------------------------------------------------------------------

[[Page 84223]]

    <bullet> failures by associated persons to comply with the member 
organization's written supervisory procedures; \23\ and
---------------------------------------------------------------------------

    \23\ See proposed NYSE Rule 3110.18(b)(2)(F), mirroring FINRA 
Rule 3110.18(b)(2)(F).
---------------------------------------------------------------------------

    <bullet> any recordkeeping violations.\24\
---------------------------------------------------------------------------

    \24\ See proposed NYSE Rule 3110.18(b)(2)(G), mirroring FINRA 
Rule 3110.18(b)(2)(G).
---------------------------------------------------------------------------

    Further, proposed Supplementary Material .18(b)(2) would prescribe 
that member organizations should conduct on-site inspections or make 
more frequent use of unannounced, on-site inspections for high-risk 
offices or locations or when there are red flags, and supervisory 
systems must take into consideration any red flags when determining 
whether to conduct a remote inspection of an office or location, 
consistent with NYSE Rule 3110(a).
    With the exception of conforming and technical changes, proposed 
NYSE Rule 3110.18(b) is substantially the same as FINRA Rule 
3110.18(b).
Proposed NYSE Rule 3110.18(c) (Written Supervisory Procedures for 
Remote Inspections)
    Proposed Supplementary Material .18(c) would provide that, 
consistent with a member organization's obligation under NYSE Rule 
3110(b), a member organization that elects to participate in the FINRA 
Pilot Program must establish, maintain, and enforce written supervisory 
procedures regarding remote inspections that are reasonably designed to 
detect and prevent violations of and achieve compliance with applicable 
securities laws and regulations, and with applicable FINRA and Exchange 
rules.
    As proposed, reasonably designed procedures for conducting remote 
inspections of offices or locations must address, among other things:
    <bullet> the methodology, including technology, that may be used to 
conduct remote inspections; \25\
---------------------------------------------------------------------------

    \25\ See proposed NYSE Rule 3110.18(c)(1), mirroring FINRA Rule 
3110.18(c)(1).
---------------------------------------------------------------------------

    <bullet> the factors considered in the risk assessment made for 
each applicable office or location pursuant to proposed Supplementary 
Material .18(b); \26\
---------------------------------------------------------------------------

    \26\ See proposed NYSE Rule 3110.18(c)(2), mirroring FINRA Rule 
3110.18(c)(2).
---------------------------------------------------------------------------

    <bullet> the procedures specified in paragraph (h)(1)(G) and (h)(4) 
of FINRA Rule 3310.18; \27\ and
---------------------------------------------------------------------------

    \27\ See proposed NYSE Rule 3110.18(c)(3), mirroring FINRA Rule 
3110.18(c)(3).
---------------------------------------------------------------------------

    <bullet> the use of other risk-based systems employed generally by 
the member organization to identify and prioritize for review those 
areas that pose the greatest risk of potential violations of applicable 
securities laws and regulations, and of applicable FINRA and Exchange 
rules.\28\
---------------------------------------------------------------------------

    \28\ See proposed NYSE Rule 3110.18(c)(4), mirroring FINRA Rule 
3110.18(c)(4).
---------------------------------------------------------------------------

    With the exception of conforming and technical changes and the 
addition of a reference to Exchange rules in proposed NYSE Rule 
3110.18(c)(4), proposed NYSE Rule 3110.18(c) is substantially the same 
as FINRA Rule 3110.18(c).
Proposed NYSE Rule 3110.18(d) (Effective Supervisory System)
    Proposed NYSE Rule 3110.18(d) would provide that the requirement to 
conduct inspections of offices and locations is one part of the member 
organization's overall obligation to have an effective supervisory 
system and therefore the member organization must maintain its ongoing 
review of the activities and functions occurring at all offices and 
locations, whether or not the member organization conducts inspections 
remotely.
    Further, a member organization's use of a remote inspection of an 
office or location will be held to the same standards for review as set 
forth under NYSE Rule 3110.12. Where a member organization's remote 
inspection of an office or location identifies any ``red flags,'' the 
member organization may need to impose additional supervisory 
procedures for that office or location or may need to provide for more 
frequent monitoring of that office or location, including potentially a 
subsequent on-site visit on an announced or unannounced basis.
    With the exception of conforming and technical changes, proposed 
NYSE Rule 3110.18(d) is substantially the same as FINRA Rule 
3110.18(d).
Proposed NYSE Rule 3110.18(e) (Documentation Requirement)
    Proposed NYSE Rule 3110.18(e) would set forth documentation 
requirements for a member organization's participating in the FINRA 
Pilot Program. In particular, proposed NYSE Rule 3110.18(e) would 
require member organizations to maintain and preserve a centralized 
record for each of the Pilot Years specified in this FINRA Pilot 
Program that separately identifies all offices or locations that were 
inspected remotely.\29\ In addition, proposed NYSE Rule 3110.18(e) 
would require documentation of the results of a remote inspection for 
any offices or locations for which the member organization determined 
to impose additional supervisory procedures or more frequent 
monitoring, as provided in proposed NYSE Rule 3110.18(d). Further, a 
member organization's documentation of the results of a remote 
inspection for an office or location must identify any additional 
supervisory procedures or more frequent monitoring for that office or 
location that were imposed as a result of the remote inspection, 
including whether an on-site inspection was conducted at such office or 
location.\30\
---------------------------------------------------------------------------

    \29\ See proposed NYSE Rule 3110.18(e)(1), mirroring FINRA Rule 
3110.18(e)(1).
    \30\ See proposed NYSE Rule 3110.18(e)(2), mirroring FINRA Rule 
3110.18(e)(2).
---------------------------------------------------------------------------

    With the exception of conforming and technical changes, proposed 
NYSE Rule 3110.18(e) is substantially the same as FINRA Rule 
3110.18(e).
Proposed NYSE Rule 3110.18(f) (Firm Level Requirements)
    Proposed NYSE Rule 3110.18(f)(1) would set forth certain firm level 
ineligibility conditions for further participation in the FINRA Pilot 
Program. As proposed, a member organization would be ineligible to 
conduct remote inspections of any of its offices or locations under the 
FINRA Pilot Program if at any time during the Pilot Period that member 
organization:
    <bullet> is or becomes designated as a Restricted Firm under FINRA 
Rule 4111; \31\
---------------------------------------------------------------------------

    \31\ See proposed NYSE Rule 3110.18(f)(1)(A), mirroring FINRA 
Rule 3110.18(f)(1)(A). The Exchange has not adopted FINRA Rule 4111.
---------------------------------------------------------------------------

    <bullet> is or become designated a taping firm under NYSE Rule 
3170; \32\
---------------------------------------------------------------------------

    \32\ See proposed NYSE Rule 3110.18(f)(1)(B), mirroring FINRA 
Rule 3110.18(f)(1)(B).
---------------------------------------------------------------------------

    <bullet> receives a notice pursuant to NYSE Rule 9557 regarding 
capital compliance related matters under NYSE Rules 4110 (Capital 
Compliance), NYSE 4120 (Regulatory Notification and Business 
Curtailment) or NYSE Rule 4130 (Regulation of Activities of Section 15C 
Member Organizations Experiencing Financial and/or Operational 
Difficulties); \33\
---------------------------------------------------------------------------

    \33\ See proposed NYSE Rule 3110.18(f)(1)(C), mirroring FINRA 
Rule 3110.18(f)(1)(C).
---------------------------------------------------------------------------

    <bullet> is or becomes suspended from Exchange or FINRA membership; 
\34\
---------------------------------------------------------------------------

    \34\ See proposed NYSE Rule 3110.18(f)(1)(D), mirroring FINRA 
Rule 3110.18(f)(1)(D).
---------------------------------------------------------------------------

    <bullet> based on the date in the Central Registration Depository 
(CRD), had its FINRA membership become effective within the prior 12 
months; \35\ or
---------------------------------------------------------------------------

    \35\ See proposed NYSE Rule 3110.18(f)(1)(E), mirroring FINRA 
Rule 3110.18(f)(1)(E).
---------------------------------------------------------------------------

    <bullet> is or has been found by the Commission, FINRA or the 
Exchange to be in violation of office inspection obligations under 
FINRA or NYSE Rule 3110(c) within the past three years.\36\
---------------------------------------------------------------------------

    \36\ See proposed NYSE Rule 3110.18(f)(1)(F), mirroring FINRA 
Rule 3110.18(f)(1)(F).

---------------------------------------------------------------------------

[[Page 84224]]

    Proposed NYSE Rule 3110.18(f)(2) would set forth the firm-level 
conditions a member organization must satisfy as part of the 
requirements in NYSE Rule 3110.18(b) to develop a reasonably designed 
risk-based approach to using remote inspections and to conduct and 
document a risk assessment for each office or location. Specifically, 
member organizations must have a recordkeeping system:
    <bullet> to make and keep current, and preserve records required to 
be made and kept current, and preserved under applicable securities 
laws and regulations, Exchange rules, and the member organization's own 
written supervisory procedures under NYSE Rule 3110; \37\
---------------------------------------------------------------------------

    \37\ See proposed NYSE Rule 3110.18(f)(2)(A)(i), mirroring FINRA 
Rule 3110.18(f)(2)(A)(i).
---------------------------------------------------------------------------

    <bullet> such records are not physically or electronically 
maintained and preserved at the office or location subject to the 
remote inspection; \38\ and
---------------------------------------------------------------------------

    \38\ See proposed NYSE Rule 3110.18(f)(2)(A)(ii), mirroring 
FINRA Rule 3110.18(f)(2)(A)(ii).
---------------------------------------------------------------------------

    <bullet> the member organization has prompt access to such 
records.\39\
---------------------------------------------------------------------------

    \39\ See proposed NYSE Rule 3110.18(f)(2)(A)(iii), mirroring 
FINRA Rule 3110.18(f)(2)(A)(iii).
---------------------------------------------------------------------------

    In addition, member organizations must determine that the 
surveillance and technology tools are appropriate to supervise the 
types of risks presented by each such remotely supervised office or 
location. As proposed, these tools may include but are not limited to:
    <bullet> firm-wide tools such as electronic recordkeeping systems; 
electronic surveillance of email and correspondence; electronic trade 
blotters; regular activity-based sampling reviews; and tools for visual 
inspections; \40\
---------------------------------------------------------------------------

    \40\ See proposed NYSE Rule 3110.18(f)(2)(B)(i), mirroring FINRA 
Rule 3110.18(f)(2)(B)(i).
---------------------------------------------------------------------------

    <bullet> tools specifically applied to such office or location 
based on the activities of associated persons, products offered, 
restrictions on the activity of the office or location (including 
holding out to customers and handling of customer funds or securities);

    With the exception of conforming and technical changes and the 
addition of a reference to Exchange rules in proposed NYSE Rule 
3110.18(f)(2)(A)(i), proposed NYSE Rule 3110.18(f)(1) and (2) are 
substantially the same as FINRA Rule 3110.18(f)(1) and (2).
Proposed NYSE Rule 3110.18(g) (Location Level Requirements)
    Proposed NYSE Rule 3110.18(g) would set forth the criteria under 
the FINRA Pilot Program that would render a particular office or 
location ineligible for remote office inspection. As proposed, NYSE 
Rule 3110.18(g)(1), offices or locations would be ineligible for a 
remote office inspection if at any time during the FINRA Pilot Period:
    <bullet> one or more associated persons at such office or location 
is or becomes subject to a mandatory heightened supervisory plan under 
the rules of the SEC, FINRA, the Exchange or a state regulatory agency; 
\43\
---------------------------------------------------------------------------

    \43\ See proposed NYSE Rule 3110.18(g)(1)(A), mirroring FINRA 
Rule 3110.18(g)(1)(A).
---------------------------------------------------------------------------

    <bullet> one or more associated persons at such office or location 
is or becomes statutorily disqualified, unless such disqualified person 
has been approved (or is otherwise permitted pursuant to FINRA or 
Exchange rules and the federal securities laws) to associate with a 
member organization and is not subject to a mandatory heightened 
supervisory plan under paragraph (g)(1)(A) of this Supplementary 
Material or otherwise as a condition to approval or permission for such 
association; \44\
---------------------------------------------------------------------------

Rule 3110.18(g)(1)(B).
---------------------------------------------------------------------------

    <bullet> the firm is or becomes subject to FINRA Rule 1017(a)(7) as 
a result of one or more associated persons at such office or location; 
\45\
---------------------------------------------------------------------------

    \45\ See proposed NYSE Rule 3110.18g)(1)(C), mirroring FINRA 
Rule 3110.18(g)(1)(C).
---------------------------------------------------------------------------

    <bullet> one or more associated persons at such office or location 
has an event in the prior three years that required a ``yes'' response 
to any item in Questions 14A(1)(a) and 2(a), 14B(1)(a) and 2(a), 14C, 
14D and 14E on Form U4; \46\
---------------------------------------------------------------------------

    \46\ See proposed NYSE Rule 3110.18(g)(1)(D), mirroring FINRA 
Rule 3110.18(g)(1)(D).
---------------------------------------------------------------------------

    <bullet> one or more associated persons at such office or location 
is or becomes subject to a disciplinary action taken by the member 
organization that is or was reportable under NYSE Rule 4530(a)(2); \47\

    \47\ See proposed NYSE Rule 3110.18(g)(1)(E), mirroring FINRA 
Rule 3110.18(g)(1)(E).

    <bullet> one or more associated persons at such office or location 
is engaged in proprietary trading, including the incidental crossing of 
customer orders, or the direct supervision of such activities; \48\ or
---------------------------------------------------------------------------

    \48\ See proposed NYSE Rule 3110.18(g)(1)(F), mirroring FINRA 
Rule 3110.18(g)(1)(F).

    <bullet> the office or location handles customer funds or 
securities.\49\
---------------------------------------------------------------------------

    \49\ See proposed NYSE Rule 3110.18(g)(1)(G), mirroring FINRA 
Rule 3110.18(g)(1)(G).
---------------------------------------------------------------------------

    In addition, as part of the requirement to develop a reasonably 
designed risk-based approach to using remote inspections, and the 
requirement to conduct and document a risk assessment, proposed NYSE 
Rule 3110.18(g)(2) would require that a specific office or location 
satisfy the following conditions to be eligible for remote inspections 
under the Pilot Program:
    <bullet> electronic communications (e.g., email) are made through 
the member organization's electronic system; \50\
---------------------------------------------------------------------------

    \50\ See proposed NYSE Rule 3110.18(g)(2)(A), mirroring FINRA 
Rule 3110.18(g)(2)(A).
---------------------------------------------------------------------------

    <bullet> the associated person's correspondence and communications 
with the public are subject to the firm's supervision in accordance 
with NYSE Rule 3110; \51\ and
---------------------------------------------------------------------------

    \51\ See proposed NYSE Rule 3110.18(g)(2)(B), mirroring FINRA 
Rule 3110.18(g)(2)(B).
---------------------------------------------------------------------------

    <bullet> no books or records of the member organization required to 
be made and kept current, and preserved under applicable securities 
laws and regulations, FINRA and Exchange rules and the member 
organization's own written supervisory procedures under NYSE Rule 3110 
are physically or electronically maintained and preserved at such 
office or location.\52\
---------------------------------------------------------------------------

    \52\ See proposed NYSE Rule 3110.18(g)(2)(C), mirroring FINRA 
Rule 3110.18(g)(2)(C).
---------------------------------------------------------------------------

    With the exception of conforming and technical changes and the 
inclusion of references to Exchange rules in proposed NYSE Rule 
3110.18(g)(1)(A) and (B), proposed NYSE Rule 3110.18(g)(1) and (2) are 
substantially the same as FINRA Rule 3110.18(g)(1) and (2).
Proposed NYSE Rule 3110.18(h) (Data and Information Collection 
Requirement)
    FINRA Rule 3110.18(h) outlines requirements for FINRA members that 
elect to participate in the Pilot Program to collect specific data and 
information as part of the FINRA Pilot Program. Specifically, FINRA 
Rule 3110.18(h) requires firms to collect specific data points and to 
provide such data and information to FINRA on a quarterly basis, in the 
manner and format determined by FINRA, including:
    <bullet> the number of offices and locations with an inspection 
completed during each calendar quarter; \53\
---------------------------------------------------------------------------

    \53\ See FINRA Rule 3110.18(h)(1)(A).
---------------------------------------------------------------------------

    <bullet> the number of those offices or locations in each calendar 
quarter that were inspected remotely; \54\
---------------------------------------------------------------------------

    \54\ See FINRA Rule 3110.18(h)(1)(B).
---------------------------------------------------------------------------

    <bullet> the number of those offices or locations in each calendar 
quarter that were the subject of an on-site inspection, as well as the 
number of

[[Page 84225]]

such inspections that were on-site because of a finding; \55\
---------------------------------------------------------------------------

    \55\ See FINRA Rule 3110.18(h)(1)(C) and (D). Pursuant to FINRA 
Rule 3110.18(h)(1), a finding means a discovery made during an 
inspection that led to a remedial action or was listed on the 
member's inspection report.
---------------------------------------------------------------------------

    <bullet> the number of offices and locations for which a remote 
office inspection was conducted in the calendar quarter that identified 
a finding, the number of findings, a list of the significant findings; 
\56\ and
---------------------------------------------------------------------------

    \56\ See FINRA Rule 3110.18(h)(1)(E).
---------------------------------------------------------------------------

    <bullet> the number of locations for which an on-site inspection 
was conducted in the calendar quarter that identified a finding, the 
number of findings, and a list of the significant findings.\57\
---------------------------------------------------------------------------

    \57\ See FINRA Rule 3110.18(h)(1)(F).
---------------------------------------------------------------------------

    Moreover, FINRA members are required to provide FINRA with their 
written supervisory procedures for remote inspections that account for 
escalating significant findings; new hires; supervising brokers with a 
significant history of misconduct; and outside business activities and 
``doing business as'' (or DBA) designations.\58\ In addition, FINRA 
Rule 3110.18(h)(2) outlines requirements for FINRA member firms 
electing to participate in the Pilot Program to provide certain data 
and information for Pilot Year 1 if it is less than a full calendar 
year and FINRA Rule 3110.18(h)(3) lists additional data and information 
to be provided to FINRA for calendar year 2019 for member firms 
electing to participate in the FINRA Pilot Program.
---------------------------------------------------------------------------

    \58\ See FINRA Rule 3110.18(h)(1)(G).
---------------------------------------------------------------------------

    Proposed NYSE Rule 3110.18(h) on data and information collection 
requirement would require member organizations to comply with the FINRA 
requirements with respect to the collection and submission of specified 
data and information, and in the manner and format required under the 
Pilot Program. In addition, proposed NYSE Rule 3110.18(h) which 
substantially mirrors FINRA Rule 3110.18(h)(4) would require member 
organizations that elect to participate in the Pilot Program to 
establish, maintain and enforce written policies and procedures that 
are reasonably designed to comply with any specified data and 
information collection, and transmission requirements prescribed by 
FINRA.
Proposed NYSE Rule 3110.18(i) (Election To Participate in Pilot 
Program)
    FINRA Rule 3110.18(i) specifies how a firm elects to participate 
in, or subsequently withdraws from, the FINRA Pilot Program. 
Specifically, FINRA Rule 3110.18(i) states that a firm must, at least 
five calendar days before the beginning of a Pilot Year, provide FINRA 
an ``opt-in notice'' in the manner and format determined by FINRA.\59\ 
Moreover, FINRA Rule 3110.18(i) specifies that a FINRA member that 
elects to withdraw from subsequent Pilot Years (i.e., Pilot Year 2, 
Pilot Year 3, and Pilot Year 4, if applicable) shall, at least five 
calendar days before the end of the then current Pilot Year, provide 
FINRA with an ``opt-out notice'' in the manner and format determined by 
FINRA.
---------------------------------------------------------------------------

    \59\ FINRA Rule 3110.18(i) contains provisions for firms wishing 
to opt-in of the FINRA Pilot Program.
---------------------------------------------------------------------------

    Proposed NYSE Rule 3110.18(i) would govern elections to participate 
in the Pilot Program and would require member organizations electing to 
participate in the Pilot Program to make their election in the manner 
and format as prescribed, in accordance with FINRA Rule 3110.18(i). In 
addition, the proposed rule would require member organizations that 
elect to withdraw from the Pilot Program for subsequent years to 
provide such notice in the manner and format as prescribed in 
accordance with FINRA Rule 3110.18(i). These requirements will ensure 
that member organizations can properly elect to participate in, or 
subsequently withdraw from, the Pilot Program.
Proposed NYSE Rule 3110.18(j) (Failure To Satisfy Conditions)
    FINRA Rule 3110.18(j) governs failure to satisfy conditions and 
addresses situations in which a member fails to satisfy the 
requirements for participating in the FINRA Pilot Program. 
Specifically, FINRA Rule 3110.18(j) provides that FINRA members that 
fail to satisfy the conditions set forth to avail themselves of the 
FINRA Pilot Program, including the requirement to timely collect and 
submit the data and information to FINRA as set forth under FINRA Rule 
3110.18(h), shall be ineligible to participate in the FINRA Pilot 
Program. Such FINRA members would be required to conduct on-site 
inspections of each office and location on the required cycle in 
accordance with FINRA Rule 3110(c) on internal inspections.
    Consistent with FINRA Rule 3110.18(j), proposed NYSE Rule 
3110.19(j) on failure to satisfy conditions would specify that any 
member organization that fails to satisfy the conditions of proposed 
Supplementary Material .18 and of FINRA Rule 3110.18, including the 
specified requirement to timely collect and submit data, would no 
longer be eligible to participate in the FINRA Pilot Program. Such 
member organizations would need to conduct on-site inspections of each 
office and location on the required cycle in accordance with NYSE Rule 
3110(c).
Proposed NYSE Rule 3110.18(k) (Determination of Ineligibility)
    FINRA Rule 3110.18(k) governs determinations of ineligibility and 
provides that FINRA may make a determination in the public interest and 
for the protection of investors that a FINRA member is no longer 
eligible to participate in the FINRA Pilot Program if the FINRA member 
fails to comply with the requirements of FINRA Rule 3110.18. In such 
instances, FINRA will provide written notice to the FINRA member of 
such determination and the member would no longer be eligible to 
participate in the FINRA Pilot Program and must conduct on-site 
inspections of required offices and locations in accordance with FINRA 
Rule 3110(c).
    Consistent with FINRA Rule 3110.18(k), proposed NYSE Rule 
3110.18(k) would govern ineligibility determinations and provide that 
FINRA or the Exchange may make a determination in the public interest 
and for the protection of investors that a member organization is no 
longer eligible to participate in the FINRA Pilot Program if the member 
organization fails to comply with the requirements of FINRA or NYSE 
Rule 3110.18. The proposed rule would further provide that, in such 
instances, FINRA or the Exchange will provide written notice to the 
member organization of such determination and the member organization 
would no longer be eligible to participate in the FINRA Pilot Program 
and must conduct on-site inspections of required offices and locations 
in accordance with FINRA or NYSE Rule 3110(c). With the exception of 
conforming and technical changes, proposed NYSE Rule 3110.18(k) is 
substantially the same as FINRA Rule 3110.18(k).
Proposed NYSE Rule 3110.18(l) (Definitions)
    The Exchange proposes to adopt FINRA Rule 3110.18(l) setting forth 
definitions applicable to Supplementary Material .18 verbatim. As 
proposed, NYSE Rule 3110.18(l) would provide that for purposes of the 
Supplementary Material, the term ``Pilot Year'' shall mean the 
following:
    <bullet> Pilot Year 1 is the period beginning on July 1, 2024 and 
ending on December 31 of the same year;
    <bullet> Pilot Year 2 means the calendar year period following 
Pilot Year 1,

[[Page 84226]]

beginning on January 1 and ending on December 31;
    <bullet> Pilot Year 3 means the calendar year period following 
Pilot Year 2, beginning on January 1 and ending on December 31; and
    <bullet> If applicable, where Pilot Year 1 covers a period that is 
less than a full calendar year, then Pilot Year 4 means the period 
following Pilot Year 3, beginning on January 1 and ending on June 30, 
2027.
    Finally, FINRA also adopted FINRA Rule 3110.18(m) describing the 
sunset of FINRA Rule 3110.17, which the Exchange has not adopted. The 
Exchange accordingly does not propose to incorporate a provision 
similar to FINRA Rule 3110.18(m).
NYSE Rule 3110, Supplementary Material .19
NYSE Rule 3110.19(a) (Conditions for Designation as a Residential 
Supervisory Location (RSL)
    FINRA Rule 3110.19(a) lists the conditions for FINRA members to 
designate an office or location as an RSL. Proposed NYSE Rule 
3110.19(a) would set forth the conditions for designation as an RSL 
that would mirror the conditions set forth in FINRA Rule 3110.19(a) for 
member organizations to designate a location that is the associated 
person's private residence where specified supervisory activities are 
conducted as an RSL.
    As proposed, NYSE Rule 3110.19 would provide that, notwithstanding 
any other provisions of NYSE Rule 3110(e) and subject to paragraphs (b) 
through (d) of the proposed Supplementary Material, a location that is 
the associated person's private residence where supervisory activities 
are conducted, including those described in NYSE Rule 3110(e)(1)(D) 
through (G) or in NYSE Rule 3110(e)(2)(B), shall be considered for 
those activities a non-branch location, provided that:
    <bullet> only one associated person, or multiple associated persons 
who reside at that location and are members of the same immediate 
family, conduct business at the location; \60\

3110.19(a)(5).
---------------------------------------------------------------------------

    <bullet> the associated person is assigned to a designated branch 
office, and such designated branch office is reflected on all business 
cards, stationery, retail communications and other communications to 
the public by such associated person; \65\

    <bullet> (A) the member organization must have a recordkeeping 
system to make and keep current, and preserve records required to be 
made and kept current, and preserved under applicable securities laws 
and regulations, Exchange rules, and the member organization's own 
written supervisory procedures under NYSE Rule 3110; (B) such records 
are not physically or electronically maintained and preserved at the 
office or location; and (C) the member organization has prompt access 
to such records; \68\ and

these tools may include but are not limited to: (A) firm-wide tools 
such as, electronic recordkeeping system; electronic surveillance of 
email and correspondence; electronic trade blotters; regular activity-
based sampling reviews; and tools for visual inspections; (B) tools

Rule NYSE 3110.19(a) is substantially the same as FINRA Rule 
3110.19(a).
NYSE Rule 3110.19(b) (Member Organization Ineligibility Criteria)
    FINRA Rule 3110.19(b) outlines the conditions that would render its 
members ineligible from designating an office as an RSL. As proposed, 
NYSE Rule 3110.19(b) would mirror these criteria and provide that a 
member organization is ineligible from designating an office or 
location as an RSL if the member organization:
    <bullet> is currently designated as a restricted firm under FINRA 
Rule 4111; \70\

3110.19(b).
NYSE Rule 3110.19(c) (Location Ineligibility Criteria)
    FINRA Rule 3110.19(c) sets forth the criteria that would render a 
particular office or location that is an associated person's private 
residence where specified supervisory activities are conducted 
ineligible for an RSL designation. Proposed NYSE Rule 3110.19(c) would 
mirror these criteria. As proposed, NYSE Rule 3110.19(c)

[[Page 84227]]

would make an office ineligible for the RSL designation if one or more 
associated persons at such office or location:
    <bullet> is a designated supervisor who has less than one year of

Act, the Investment Advisers Act, the Investment Company Act, the 
Commodity Exchange Act, any state law pertaining to the regulation of 
securities or any rule or regulation under any of such Acts or laws, or 
any of the rules of the Exchange or other self-regulatory organization, 
including the Exchange; provided, however, such office or location may 
be designated or redesignated as an RSL subject to the requirements of 
this Supplementary Material upon the earlier of: (i) the member 
organization's receipt of written notification from the applicable 
Regulator that such Investigation has concluded without further action; 
or (ii) one year from the date of the last communication from such 
Regulator relating to such Investigation.\82\

    \82\ See proposed NYSE Rule 3110.19(c)(6), mirroring FINRA Rule 
3110.19(c)(6).
---------------------------------------------------------------------------

    With the exception of conforming and technical changes, proposed 
NYSE Rule 3110.19(c) is substantially the same as FINRA Rule 
3110.19(c).
NYSE Rule 3110.19(d) (Obligation To Provide List of RSLs)
    Proposed NYSE Rule 3110.19(d) setting forth the obligations to 
provide RSL list would fully mirror the provisions of FINRA Rule 
3110.19(d) and would require member organizations electing to designate 
any office or location of that member organization as an RSL to provide 
a current list of all offices or locations designated as RSLs by the 
15th day of the month following each calendar quarter to FINRA in the 
manner and format as FINRA may prescribe.\83\
---------------------------------------------------------------------------

    \83\ Pursuant to Rule 0, reference to Exchange staff or Exchange 
departments in the NYSE rules should be understood as also referring 
to FINRA staff and FINRA departments acting on behalf of the 
Exchange.
---------------------------------------------------------------------------

    With the exception of conforming and technical changes, proposed 
NYSE Rule 3110.19(d) is substantially the same as FINRA Rule 
3110.19(d).
NYSE Rule 3110.19(e) (Risk Assessment)
    FINRA Rule 3110.19(e) requires its members, prior to designating an 
office or location as an RSL, to develop a reasonable risk-based 
approach to designating such office or location as an RSL, and conduct 
and document a risk assessment for the associated person assigned to 
that office or location. Proposed NYSE Rule 3110.19(e) would mirror the 
provisions of FINRA Rule 3110.19(e). Specifically, a member 
organization would be required, prior to designating an office or 
location as an RSL, to develop a reasonable risk-based approach to 
designating such office or location as an RSL and conduct and document 
a risk assessment for the associated person(s) assigned to that office 
or location. In line with FINRA Rule 3110.19(e), the proposed rule 
would list certain factors, among others, that member organizations 
must consider in the risk assessment that include whether each 
associated person at such office or location is subject to:
    <bullet> customer complaints, taking into account the volume and 
nature of the complaints; \84\
---------------------------------------------------------------------------

    \84\ See proposed NYSE Rule 3110.19(e)(1), mirroring FINRA Rule 
3110.19(e)(1).
---------------------------------------------------------------------------

    <bullet> heightened supervision other than where such office or 
location is ineligible for RSL designation under paragraph (c)(3) of 
this Supplementary Material; \85\
---------------------------------------------------------------------------

    \85\ See proposed NYSE Rule 3110.19(e)(2), mirroring FINRA Rule 
3110.19(e)(2).
---------------------------------------------------------------------------

    <bullet> any failure to comply with the member organization's 
written supervisory procedures; \86\
---------------------------------------------------------------------------

    \86\ See proposed NYSE Rule 3110.19(e)(3), mirroring FINRA Rule 
3110.19(e)(3).

    \87\ See proposed NYSE Rule 3110.19(e)(4), mirroring FINRA Rule 
3110.19(e)(4).
---------------------------------------------------------------------------

    <bullet> any regulatory communications from a Regulator, indicating 
that the associated person at such office or location failed reasonably 
to supervise another person subject to their supervision, including but 
not limited to, subpoenas, preliminary or routine regulatory inquiries 
or requests for information, deficiency letters, ``blue sheet'' 
requests or other trading questionnaires, or examinations. The member 
organization must take into account any higher risk activities that 
take place or a higher risk associated person that is assigned to that 
office or location. Consistent with its obligation under NYSE Rule 
3110(a), the member organization's supervisory system must take into 
consideration any indicators of irregularities or misconduct (i.e., 
``red flags'') when designating an office or

[[Page 84228]]

location as an RSL. Red flags should also be reviewed in determining 
whether it is reasonable to maintain the RSL designation of such office 
or location in accordance with the requirements of this Supplementary 
Material and the member organization should consider evidencing steps 
taken to address those red flags where appropriate.\88\

    With the exception of conforming and technical changes, proposed 
NYSE Rule 3110.19(e) is substantially the same as FINRA Rule 
3110.19(e).
2. Statutory Basis
    The proposed rule change is consistent with Section 6(b) of the 
Act,\89\ in general, and furthers the objectives of Section 
6(b)(5),\90\ in particular, because it is designed to prevent 
fraudulent and manipulative acts and practices, to promote just and 
equitable principles of trade, to foster cooperation and coordination 
with persons engaged in facilitating transactions in securities, to 
remove impediments to, and perfect the mechanism of, a free and open 
market and a national market system and, in general, to protect 
investors and the public interest.
---------------------------------------------------------------------------

    \89\ 15 U.S.C. 78f(b).
    \90\ 15 U.S.C. 78f(b)(5).
---------------------------------------------------------------------------

    The Exchange believes that the proposed rule change furthers the 
objectives of the Act by permitting member organizations that are FINRA 
members to participate in the FINRA Pilot Program and for all member 
organizations to utilize the RSL designation in order to continue to 
meet the core regulatory obligation to establish and maintain a 
supervisory system reasonably designed to achieve compliance with 
applicable securities laws and regulations and applicable Exchange 
rules that directly serve investor protection. The Exchange believes 
that the proposed changes, taken together, reasonably account for 
evolving work models while maintaining effective supervision. The 
Exchange believes that the proposed safeguards and controls built into 
both the remote inspection program and the RSL designation will, as 
FINRA noted,\91\ provide member organizations with greater flexibility 
to adapt to changing work conditions without compromising investor 
protection. The robust nature of the criteria that must be satisfied 
and circumstances that would make a location ineligible for remote 
office inspections, as well as requirements for supplemental written 
supervisory procedures related to remote inspections, documentation 
requirements, and obligations to share data with FINRA to allow for 
assessment of the pilot program, serve an important role in reducing 
the potential for fraud and manipulative acts. Similarly, important 
safeguards such as requiring risk assessments in connection with the 
RSL designation in addition to delineating specific criteria for 
locations that would be ineligible for designation as an RSL furthers 
the prevention of manipulative acts and practices and the protection of 
investors and the public interest.

    \91\ See Securities Exchange Act Release No. 97398 (November 17, 
2023), 88 FR 28620, 28635 (May 4, 2023) (SR-FINRA-2023-007) (Notice 
of Filing of a Proposed Rule Change To Adopt Supplementary Material 
.18 (Remote Inspections Pilot Program) Under FINRA Rule 3110 
(Supervision)); Securities Exchange Act Release No. 97237 (March 31, 
2023), 88 FR 20568 (April 6, 2023) (SR-FINRA-2023-006) (Notice of 
Filing of a Proposed Rule Change To Adopt Supplementary Material .19 
(Residential Supervisory Location) Under FINRA Rule 3110 
(Supervision)).
---------------------------------------------------------------------------

    As discussed in the Purpose section, because proposed Supplementary 
Material .18 to NYSE Rule 3110 and proposed Supplementary Material .19 
to NYSE Rule 3110 are substantially similar to FINRA Rule 3110.18 and 
FINRA Rule 3110.19, respectively, this rule change enables NYSE Rule 
3110 to continue to be incorporated into the 17d-2 Agreement, resulting 
in less burdensome and more efficient regulatory compliance. 
Specifically, the proposed change will conform the Exchange's rules to 
changes made to corresponding FINRA rules insofar as a member 
organization's compliance with FINRA Rules 3110.18 and 3110.19 shall 
mean the member organization is also in compliance with proposed 
Supplementary Material.18 to NYSE Rule 3110 and proposed Supplementary 
Material .19 to NYSE Rule 3110, thus promoting the application of 
consistent regulatory standards with respect to rules that FINRA 
enforces pursuant to the 17d-2 Agreement. As previously noted, except 
for conforming and technical changes, the proposed text of proposed 
Supplementary Material .18 and .19 to NYSE Rule 3110 is substantially 
the same as the text of FINRA Supplementary Material .18 and .19, 
respectively, to FINRA Rule 3110. As such, the proposed rule change 
would facilitate rule harmonization among self-regulatory organizations 
with respect to inspection of member organizations and a consistent and 
uniform regulatory framework for which member organizations can avail 
themselves of the RSL designation, thereby fostering cooperation and 
coordination with persons engaged in facilitating transactions in 
securities and will remove impediments to and perfect the mechanism of 
a free and open market and a national market system.

B. Self-Regulatory Organization's Statement on Burden on Competition

    The Exchange does not believe that the proposed rule change will 
impose any burden on competition that is not necessary or appropriate 
in furtherance of the purposes of the Act. The proposed rule change is 
not intended to address competitive issues but rather is intended 
solely to reduce potential compliance burdens on member organizations 
by aligning NYSE Rule 3110 with FINRA Rule 3110, resulting in less 
burdensome and more efficient regulatory compliance for common members 
and facilitating FINRA's performance under the 17d-2 Agreement.

C. Self-Regulatory Organization's Statement on Comments on the Proposed 
Rule Change Received From Members, Participants, or Others

    No written comments were solicited or received with respect to the 
proposed rule change.

III. Date of Effectiveness of the Proposed Rule Change and Timing for 
Commission Action

    The Exchange has filed the proposed rule change pursuant to Section 
19(b)(3)(A)(iii) of the Act \92\ and Rule 19b-4(f)(6) thereunder.\93\ 
Because the proposed rule change does not: (i) significantly affect the 
protection of investors or the public interest; (ii) impose any 
significant burden on competition; and (iii) become operative prior to 
30 days from the date on which it was filed, or such shorter time as 
the Commission may designate, if consistent with the protection of 
investors and the public interest, the proposed rule change has become 
effective pursuant to Section 19(b)(3)(A) of the Act and Rule 19b-
4(f)(6)(iii) thereunder. In addition, the Exchange provided the 
Commission with written notice of its intent to file the proposed rule 
change, along with a brief description and text of the proposed rule 
change, at least five business days prior to the date of filing.\94\
---------------------------------------------------------------------------

    \92\ 15 U.S.C. 78s(b)(3)(A)(iii).
    \93\ 17 CFR 240.19b-4(f)(6).
    \94\ 17 CFR 240.19b-4(f)(6)(iii).
---------------------------------------------------------------------------

    A proposed rule change filed under Rule 19b-4(f)(6) \95\ normally 
does not become operative prior to 30 days after the date of the 
filing. However, pursuant to Rule 19b4(f)(6)(iii),\96\ the Commission

[[Page 84229]]

may designate a shorter time if such action is consistent with the 
protection of investors and the public interest. The Exchange has asked 
the Commission to waive the 30-day operative delay so that the proposal 
may become operative immediately upon filing.
---------------------------------------------------------------------------

    \96\ 17 CFR 240.19b-4(f)(6)(iii).
---------------------------------------------------------------------------

    The Exchange stated that this proposed rule change is non-
controversial because it does not present any new or novel issues. In 
particular, NYSE is harmonizing its supervision rules with those of 
FINRA, on which they are based and which have been previously approved 
by the Commission. By conforming the Exchange's rules to FINRA's, the 
proposed rule change would promote the application of consistent 
regulatory standards with respect to rules that FINRA enforces pursuant 
to the 17d-2 Agreement. As such, the Exchange believes that the 
proposed rule change would foster cooperation and coordination with 
persons engaged in facilitating transactions in securities and would 
remove impediments to and perfect the mechanism of a free and open 
market and a national market system in accordance with Exchange Act 
Section 6(b)(5). Further, the Exchange stated that waiver of the 
operative delay should reduce any potential confusion that may 
otherwise occur on the part of joint members of the Exchange and FINRA 
as to the applicable rules governing inspections of branch offices and 
other locations. For these reasons, the Commission believes that waiver 
of the 30-day operative delay for this proposed rule change is 
consistent with the protection of investors and the public interest. 
Accordingly, the Commission hereby waives the 30-day operative delay 
and designates the proposed rule change operative upon filing.\97\
---------------------------------------------------------------------------

    \97\ For purposes only of waiving the 30-day operative delay, 
the Commission has considered the proposed rule change's impact on 
efficiency, competition, and capital formation. See 15 U.S.C. 
78c(f).
---------------------------------------------------------------------------

    At any time within 60 days of the filing of such proposed rule 
change, the Commission summarily may temporarily suspend such rule 
change if it appears to the Commission that such action is necessary or 
appropriate in the public interest, for the protection of investors, or 
otherwise in furtherance of the purposes of the Act. If the Commission 
takes such action, the Commission shall institute proceedings under 
Section 19(b)(2)(B) \98\ of the Act to determine whether the proposed 
rule change should be approved or disapproved.
