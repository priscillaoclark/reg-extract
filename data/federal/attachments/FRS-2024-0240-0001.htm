Final Approval Under OMB Delegated Authority of the Extension for Three 
Years, With Revision, of the Following Information Collection

    Collection title: Reporting, Recordkeeping, and Disclosure 
Requirements Associated with Regulation YY.
    Collection identifier: FR YY.
    OMB control number: 7100-0350.
    General description of collection: Section 165 of the Dodd-Frank 
Wall Street Reform and Consumer Protection Act authorizes the Board to 
implement enhanced prudential standards and impose requirements related 
to stress tests on certain financial companies. The Board has relied on 
this authority to enact Regulation YY--Enhanced Prudential Standards 
(12 CFR part 252). The enhanced prudential standards and other 
requirements contained in Regulation YY include risk-based and leverage 
capital requirements, liquidity standards, requirements for overall 
risk management (including establishing a risk committee), stress test 
requirements, and debt-to-equity limits for companies that the 
Financial Stability Oversight Council has determined pose a grave 
threat to financial stability. The FR YY information collection 
includes reporting, recordkeeping, and disclosure requirements 
contained in Regulation YY.
    Frequency: Quarterly, biennial, annual, and event-generated.
    Respondents: U.S. bank holding companies, domestic and foreign 
nonbank systemically important financial institutions, state member 
banks, foreign banking organizations, and U.S. intermediate holding 
companies.
    Total estimated number of respondents: 43.
    Total estimated change in burden: 2,578.
    Total estimated annual burden hours: 26,458.
    Current actions: On March 29, 2024, the Board published a notice in 
the Federal Register (89 FR 22150) requesting public comment for 60 
days on the extension, with revision, of the FR YY. The Board proposed 
to revise the FR YY to take into account existing provisions in 
Regulation YY that included information collections, but had not been 
included in previous clearances. The comment period for this notice 
expired on May 28, 2024. The Board did not receive any comments. The 
revisions will be implemented as proposed.
