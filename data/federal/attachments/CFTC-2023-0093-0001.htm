Committee'' for any nominations you submit.

FOR FURTHER INFORMATION CONTACT: Lauren Fulks, EEMAC Secretary, (816) 
960-7719 or email: <a href="/cdn-cgi/l/email-protection#1b777d6e7770685b787d6f78357c746d"><span class="__cf_email__" data-cfemail="107c76657c7b6350737664733e777f66">[email&#160;protected]</span></a>.

SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION: The EEMAC was established to conduct public 
meetings; submit reports and recommendations to the Commission; and 
otherwise serve as a vehicle for discussion and communication on 
matters of concern to exchanges, trading firms, end users, energy 
producers, and regulators regarding energy and environmental markets 
and their regulation by the Commission.
    Pursuant to the EEMAC's authorizing statute, the EEMAC must have 
nine members. In addition, the EEMAC Charter requires that the 
Committee have approximately 9-20 Associate Members. With several 
Associate Members' terms recently expiring, Commissioner Summer K. 
Mersinger, the EEMAC's Sponsor, seeks additional Associate Members of 
the EEMAC.
    Accordingly, the Commission invites the submission of nominations 
for EEMAC Associate Members who represent a wide diversity of opinions 
and a broad spectrum of interests related to the energy and 
environmental markets and their regulation by the Commission. To advise 
the Commission effectively, EEMAC Associate Members must have a high 
level of expertise and experience in the energy and/or environmental 
markets and the Commission's regulation of such markets, including from 
a historical perspective. To the extent practicable, the Commission 
will strive to select members reflecting wide ethnic, racial, gender, 
and age representation. All EEMAC Associate Members must be willing to 
participate in a public forum.
    Each nomination submission must provide relevant information about 
the proposed Associate Member: the individual's name, title, 
organizational affiliation and address, email address and telephone 
number, as well as information that supports the individual's 
qualifications to serve as an Associate Member of the EEMAC (e.g., C.V. 
or resume). The submission must also include the name, email address, 
and telephone number of the person nominating the proposed Associate 
Member. Self-nominations are acceptable.
    Submission of a nomination is not a guarantee of selection as an 
Associate Member of the EEMAC. As noted in the EEMAC's Charter, the 
CFTC identifies Associate Members of the EEMAC through a variety of 
methods. Such methods may include public requests for nominations for 
membership; recommendations from existing advisory committee members; 
consultations with knowledgeable persons outside the CFTC (industry, 
consumer groups, other state or federal government agencies, academia, 
etc.); requests to be represented received from individuals and 
organizations; and Commissioners' and CFTC staff's professional 
knowledge of those experienced in the energy and environmental markets. 
The office of the Commissioner primarily responsible for the EEMAC 
plays a primary, but not exclusive, role in this process and makes 
recommendations regarding membership to the Commission. The Commission, 
by vote, authorizes Associate Members to serve on the EEMAC.
    Associate Members may be appointed as representatives, special 
government employees, or regular government employees. Associate 
Members serve at the pleasure of the Commission, and may be appointed 
to serve for one, two, or three-year terms. As required by the EEMAC 
Charter, Associate Members provide their reports and recommendations 
directly to the EEMAC and not the Commission. Associate Members do not 
have the right to vote on matters before the EEMAC and may not sign or 
otherwise formally approve reports or recommendations made by the EEMAC 
to the Commission. Associate Members do not receive compensation for 
their services, and are not reimbursed for travel and per diem 
expenses. The EEMAC meets at such intervals as are necessary to carry 
out its functions and must meet at least two times per year. Associate 
Members are expected to provide their advice and recommendations to 
EEMAC members during these meetings.

Paperwork Reduction Act

    Notwithstanding any other provisions of the law, no person is 
required to respond to, nor shall any person be subjected to a penalty 
for failure to comply with, a collection of information subject to the 
requirements of the Paperwork Reduction Act, unless that collection of 
information displays a currently valid OMB Control Number. For this 
collection, OMB has issued control number 3038-0119.

Privacy Act of 1974

    The information we collect about you is covered by the Privacy Act 
of 1974. The CFTC is providing this statement to you as required by 5 
U.S.C. 552a(e)(3). We are authorized to collect information from you 
pursuant to the Federal Advisory Committee Act, 5 U.S.C. 1001 et seq., 
and 7 U.S.C. 2(a)(15). The purpose of this collection is to maintain 
information on CFTC advisory committee and subcommittee applicants and 
members, and those who make recommendations for committee or 
subcommittee memberships or otherwise interact with the CFTC regarding 
its advisory committees and subcommittees. The CFTC will use the 
information primarily for the administration of its advisory committees 
and subcommittees, including as part of the member evaluation and 
selection process. The CFTC may also share your information externally 
as a ``routine use'' with, for example, committee and subcommittee 
Chairs and co-Chairs to conduct committee and subcommittee activities, 
the public as permitted or required to provide information about the 
committee or subcommittee and receive input regarding the work of the 
committee or subcommittee, and with other Federal agencies and entities 
as necessary for oversight, litigation, and breach response. For a 
complete list of routine uses, please see the CFTC's system of records 
notice CFTC-58 Advisory Committees, available at <a href="https://www.cftc.gov/privacy">https://www.cftc.gov/privacy</a> and 88 FR 20146. Providing the requested information is 
voluntary, but if you choose not to provide it, the CFTC may not be 
able to consider you for

administer its advisory committee or subcommittee activities.
