ceased to be an investment company. Applicant states that it has no 
contractowners and no outstanding contracts that allocate premiums and 
contract value to the Separate Account. The contract registered on Form

sold to only one (1) contractowner; that sale occurred on April 20, 
2009. That one (1) contract was surrendered on November 24, 2009. 
Because the Depositor has decided to discontinue sales of the contract 
and has no plans to develop any other variable annuity contracts that 
would be supported by the Separate Account, and because there are 
currently no assets in the Separate Account or its subaccounts, the 
Depositor has determined that it will not use the Separate Account as a 
funding medium to support reserves for future sales of any other 
variable annuity contract and that the Separate Account should be 
deregistered.
