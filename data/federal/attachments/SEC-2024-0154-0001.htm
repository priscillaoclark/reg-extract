I. Introduction

    1. On December 10, 2019, the Commission issued an order \1\ (as 
subsequently amended,\2\ the ``Prior Order'') \3\ under section 6(c) of 
the Act

[[Page 7757]]

for an exemption from sections 2(a)(32), 5(a)(1), 22(d), and 22(e) of 
the Act and rule 22c-1 under the Act, under sections 6(c) and 17(b) of 
the Act for an exemption from sections 17(a)(1) and 17(a)(2) of the 
Act, and under section 12(d)(1)(J) of the Act for an exemption from 
sections 12(d)(1)(A) and 12(d)(1)(B) of the Act.\4\ The Prior Order 
permits Applicants to operate a novel type of actively-managed 
exchange-traded fund (``ETF'') that is not required to disclose its 
full portfolio holdings on a daily basis (each, a ``Fund''). Rather, 
pursuant to the Prior Order, each Business Day \5\ a Fund publishes a 
basket of securities and cash that, while different from the Fund's 
portfolio, is designed to closely track its daily performance (the 
``Portfolio Reference Basket'').

Investment Company Act Release No. 33682 (Nov. 14, 2019) (notice) 
and Investment Company Act Release No. 33710 (Dec. 10, 2019) 
(order).
    \2\ See Blue Tractor ETF Trust and Blue Tractor Group, LLC, 
Investment Company Act Release No. 34194 (Feb. 10, 2021) (notice) 
and Investment Company Act Release No. 34221 (Mar. 9, 2021) (order).
    \3\ Except as specifically noted in the application for the 
Amended Order, all representations and conditions contained in the 
application first submitted with the Commission (File No. 812-
14625), as amended and restated, and filed with the Commission on 
October 23, 2019 (the ``First Application''), as modified according 
to the application for an amended order subsequently submitted with 
the Commission (File No. 812-15162), as amended and restated, and 
filed with the Commission on January 19, 2021, remain applicable to 
the operation of the Funds and will apply to any Funds relying on 
the Amended Order.
    \4\ The relief granted under section 12(d)(1)(J) of the Act for 
an exemption from sections 12(d)(1)(A) and 12(d)(1)(B) of the Act 
(the ``Section 12(d)(1) Relief''), and relief under sections 6(c) 
and 17(b) of the Act for an exemption from sections 17(a)(1) and 
17(a)(2) of the Act relating to the Section 12(d)(1) Relief, expired 
on January 19, 2022. See Fund of Funds Arrangements, Investment 
Company Act Rel. No. 10871 (Oct. 7, 2020), at III.
    \5\ See First Application at 12.
---------------------------------------------------------------------------

    2. Under the Prior Order, a Fund may not borrow for investment 
purposes or hold short positions. Applicants now seek to amend the 
Prior Order to permit a Fund to engage in short selling, but only in 
the same types of instruments that a Fund is permitted to hold as long 
positions in its actual portfolio (``Portfolio Instruments'').\6\
---------------------------------------------------------------------------

    \6\ See First Application at 8.
---------------------------------------------------------------------------

II. The Application

A. Applicants' Proposal

    3. Upon amending the Prior Order, the Portfolio Reference Basket 
will be constructed in the same manner as described in the Prior Order, 
except that it will include a first portion corresponding to the long 
positions in the Fund's actual portfolio and a second portion 
corresponding to the short positions in the Fund's actual portfolio. 
Applicants represent that, in the aggregate, the Portfolio Reference 
Basket will provide an arbitrage tool to allow market participants to 
price and hedge their positions in the ETF shares.
    4. As described in the application, a Fund will disclose publicly 
on its website the respective aggregate weightings of the long and 
short positions in the Fund's actual portfolio. In this manner, 
Applicants represent that market participants will understand the 
overall long and short exposures in the Fund's actual portfolio even 
though the weightings of individual long and short positions in the 
Portfolio Reference Basket will be different than the weightings of 
those individual long and short positions within the Fund's actual 
portfolio. Applicants also represent that although short positions 
cannot be transferred within the Fund's creation basket, long positions 
and cash amounts representing the net value of short positions would be 
included in the Fund's creation basket, just as with ETFs relying on 
Rule 6c-11.

B. Considerations Relating to the Requested Relief

    5. Applicants represent that they do not believe that the use of 
short positions related to the Portfolio Instruments will give rise to 
any new policy concerns, stating that the disclosure of short positions 
will not change the ability of arbitrageurs and market participants to 
recognize, value, and execute on arbitrage opportunities. Applicants 
represent that the inclusion of short positions in the actual portfolio 
and disclosure of those short positions in the Portfolio Reference 
Basket will not disrupt the correlation between the performance of the 
Portfolio Reference Basket and the actual portfolio. Applicants also 
believe that the pricing of short positions in the Portfolio 
Instruments should be as readily ascertainable as the pricing of long 
positions in those same Portfolio Instruments because the pricing of 
the short positions will reflect the liquidity and pricing transparency 
of the related Portfolio Instruments. As noted above, moreover, 
Applicants have committed that the Funds would publish daily the 
aggregate short exposure of the actual portfolio and the aggregate long 
exposure of the actual portfolio so that market participants will have 
even more information about the ways in which the positions in the 
Portfolio Reference Basket relate to the actual portfolio.

III. Requested Exemptive Relief

    Applicants believe that the Prior Order, as amended, continues to 
meet the relevant standards for relief pursuant to section 6(c) of the 
Act for an exemption from sections 2(a)(32), 5(a)(1), 22(d), and 22(e) 
of the Act and rule 22c-1 under the Act, and under sections 6(c) and 
17(b) of the Act for an exemption from sections 17(a)(1) and 17(a)(2) 
of the Act.\7\
---------------------------------------------------------------------------

    \7\ See supra note 4.
---------------------------------------------------------------------------

IV. Applicants' Conditions

    Applicants agree that the Amended Order granting the requested 
relief will be subject to all of the conditions in the Prior Order.

    For the Commission, by the Division of Investment Management, 
pursuant to delegated authority.
Sherry R. Haywood,
Assistant Secretary.
