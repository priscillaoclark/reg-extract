SECURITIES AND EXCHANGE COMMISSION

[SEC File No. 270-221, OMB Control No. 3235-0232]


Proposed Collection; Comment Request; Extension: Form 1-E, 
Regulation E

Upon Written Request, Copies Available From: Securities and Exchange 
Commission, Office of FOIA Services, 100 F Street NE, Washington, DC 
20549-2736

    Notice is hereby given that, pursuant to the Paperwork Reduction 
Act of 1995 (44 U.S.C. 3501 et seq.), the Securities and Exchange 
Commission (the ``Commission'') is soliciting comments on the 
collection of information summarized below. The Commission plans to 
submit this existing collection of information of the Office of 
Management and Budget for extension and approval.
    Form 1-E (17 CFR 239.200) under the Securities Act of 1933 (15 
U.S.C. 77a et seq.) (``Securities Act'') is the form that a small 
business investment company

[[Page 73174]]

(``SBIC'') or business development company (``BDC'') uses to notify the 
Commission that it is claiming an exemption under Regulation E from 
registering its securities under the Securities Act. Rule 605 of 
Regulation E (17 CFR 230.605) under the Securities Act requires an SBIC 
or BDC claiming such an exemption to file an offering circular with the 
Commission that must also be provided to persons to whom an offer is 
made. Form 1-E requires an issuer to provide the names and addresses of 
the issuer, its affiliates, directors, officers, and counsel; a 
description of events which would make the exemption unavailable; the 
jurisdictions in which the issuer intends to offer the securities; 
information about unregistered securities issued or sold by the issuer 
within one year before filing the notification on Form 1-E; information 
as to whether the issuer is presently offering or contemplating 
offering any other securities; and exhibits, including copies of the 
rule 605 offering circular and any underwriting contracts.
    The Commission uses the information provided in the notification on 
Form 1-E and the offering circular to determine whether an offering 
qualifies for the exemption under Regulation E. The Commission 
estimates that, each year, one issuer files one notification on Form 1-
E, together with offering circulars, with the Commission.\1\ Based on 
the Commission's experience with disclosure documents, we estimate that 
the burden from compliance with Form 1-E and the offering circular 
requires approximately 100 hours per filing. The annual burden hours 
for compliance with Form 1-E and the offering circular would be 200 
hours (2 responses x 100 hours per response). Estimates of the burden 
hours are made solely for the purposes of the PRA, and are not derived 
from a comprehensive or even a representative survey or study of the 
costs of SEC rules and forms.
---------------------------------------------------------------------------

    \1\ According to Commission records, one issuer filed two 
notifications on Form 1-E, together with offering circulars, during 
2013 and 2014.
---------------------------------------------------------------------------

    Written comments are invited on: (a) whether the proposed 
collection of information is necessary for the proper performance of 
the functions of the Commission, including whether the information 
shall have practical utility; (b) the accuracy of the Commission's 
estimate of the burden of the collection of information; (c) ways to 
enhance the quality, utility, and clarity of the information collected; 
and (d) ways to minimize the burden of the collection of information on 
respondents, including through the use of automated collection 
techniques or other forms of information technology. Consideration will 
be given to comments and suggestions submitted by November 8, 2024.
    An agency may not conduct or sponsor, and a person is not required 
to respond to, a collection of information under the PRA unless it 
displays a currently valid OMB control number.
    Please direct your written comments to: Austin Gerig, Director/
Chief Data Officer, Securities and Exchange Commission, c/o Oluwaseun 
Ajayi, 100 F Street NE, Washington, DC 20549 or send an email to:

Secretary.
