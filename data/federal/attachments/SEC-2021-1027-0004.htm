    Notice is hereby given that, pursuant to the Paperwork Reduction

Commission (``Commission'') has submitted to the Office of Management 
and Budget this request for extension of the previously approved 
collection of information discussed below.
    Form 1-U (17 CFR 239.93) is used to file current event reports by 
Tier 2 issuers under Regulation A, an exemption from registration under

significant events. We estimate that approximately 1,502 issuers file 
Form 1-U annually. We estimate that Form 1-U takes approximately 5.0 
hours to prepare. We estimate that 85% of the 5.0 hours per response is 
prepared by the company for a total annual burden of 6,384 hours (4.25 
hours per response x 1,502 responses).
    An agency may not conduct or sponsor, and a person is not required 
to respond to, a collection of information unless it displays a 
currently valid control number.

this information collection request opens on December 11, 2024 and
