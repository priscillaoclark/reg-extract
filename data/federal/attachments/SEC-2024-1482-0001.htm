45 days of the publication of notice of the filing of a proposed rule 
change, the Commission shall either approve the proposed rule change, 
disapprove the proposed rule change, or institute proceedings to 
determine whether the proposed rule change should be disapproved unless 
the Commission extends the period within which it must act as provided 
in Section 19(b)(2)(ii) of the Exchange Act.\6\ Section 19(b)(2)(ii) of 
the Exchange Act allows the Commission to designate a longer period for

    The 45th day after publication of the Notice of Filing is October

to designate a longer period within which to act on the Proposed Rule 
Change and therefore is extending this 45-day time period.
    Accordingly, the Commission, pursuant to Section 19(b)(2) of the 
Exchange Act,\8\ designates December 2, 2024, as the date by which the 
Commission shall either approve, disapprove, or institute proceedings 
to determine whether to disapprove proposed rule change SR-NSCC-2024-
006.
