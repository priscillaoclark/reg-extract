NATIONAL LABOR RELATIONS BOARD

29 CFR Part 103

RIN 3142-AA22


Representation--Case Procedures: Election Bars; Proof of Majority 
Support in Construction Industry Collective-Bargaining Relationships

AGENCY: National Labor Relations Board.

ACTION: Notice of proposed rulemaking; extension of responsive comment 
period.

-----------------------------------------------------------------------

SUMMARY: The National Labor Relations Board (the Board) published a 
Notice of Proposed Rulemaking in the Federal Register on November 4, 
2022, seeking comments from the public regarding its proposed rule 
concerning Representation--Case Procedures: Election Bars; Proof of 
Majority Support in Construction Industry Collective-Bargaining 
Relationships (``NPRM''). The deadline for initial comments was 
extended on December 1, 2022, to February 2, 2023, with responsive 
comments due on February 16, 2023. The date to submit responsive 
comments to the initial comments is being extended due to an 
administrative error that occurred within <a href="http://Regulations.gov">Regulations.gov</a> that 
inadvertently allowed six comments to be filed on a closed NLRB 
rulemaking docket from 2018. These comments have been moved to the 
correct NPRM docket.

DATES: The responsive comment period for the proposed rule published 
November 4, 2022, at 87 FR 66890, extended December 1, 2022, at 87 FR 
73705, is further extended. Responsive comments to initial comments 
must be received by the Board on or before March 1, 2023.

ADDRESSES: 
    Internet--Federal eRulemaking Portal. Electronic comments may be 
submitted through <a href="http://www.regulations.gov">http://www.regulations.gov</a>. Follow the instructions 
for submitting comments.
    Delivery--Comments may be submitted by mail or hand delivery to: 
Roxanne L. Rothschild, Executive Secretary, National Labor Relations 
Board, 1015 Half Street SE, Washington, DC 20570-0001. Because of 
security precautions, the Board continues to experience delays in U.S. 
mail delivery. You should take this into consideration when preparing 
to meet the deadline for submitting comments. The Board encourages 
electronic filing. It is not necessary to send comments if they have 
been filed electronically with regulations.gov. If you send comments, 
the Board recommends that you confirm receipt of your delivered

SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION: The Board sought comments from the public 
regarding its November 4, 2022, NPRM. Pursuant to an extension 
published on December 1, 2022, initial comments were due on February 2, 
2023, and responsive comments were due on February 16, 2023. The Board 
is extending the responsive comment deadline due to an administrative 
error that occurred within <a href="http://Regulations.gov">Regulations.gov</a> that inadvertently allowed

These comments have been moved to the correct NPRM docket. The new due

address.
    The Board will post, as soon as practicable, all comments received 
on <a href="http://www.regulations.gov">http://www.regulations.gov</a> without making any changes to the 
comments, including any personal information provided. The website 
<a href="http://www.regulations.gov">http://www.regulations.gov</a> is the Federal eRulemaking portal, and all

Board requests that comments include full citations or internet links
