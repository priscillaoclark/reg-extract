Background

    The Iranian Transactions Regulations, 31 CFR part 560 (the 
``ITR''), implement a series of Executive Orders that began with 
Executive Order 12613 of October 30, 1987, issued pursuant to 
authorities including the International Security and Development 
Cooperation Act of 1985 (22 U.S.C. 2349aa-9). In that order, after 
finding, inter alia, that the Government of Iran was actively 
supporting terrorism as an instrument of state policy, the President 
prohibited the importation of Iranian-origin goods and services. 
Subsequently, in Executive Order 12957, issued on March 15, 1995, under 
the authority of, inter alia, the International Emergency Economic 
Powers Act (50 U.S.C. 1701-1706) (``IEEPA''), the President declared a 
national emergency with respect to the actions and policies of the 
Government of Iran, including its support for international terrorism, 
its efforts to undermine the Middle East peace process, and its efforts 
to acquire weapons of mass destruction and the means to deliver them. 
To deal with that threat, Executive Order 12957 imposed prohibitions on 
certain transactions with respect to the development of Iranian 
petroleum resources. On May 6, 1995, to further respond to this threat, 
the President issued Executive Order 12959, which imposed comprehensive 
trade and financial sanctions on Iran. Finally, on August 19, 1997, the 
President issued Executive Order 13059 consolidating and clarifying the 
previous orders.
    Section Sec.  560.516 of the ITR contains authorizations with 
respect to certain transactions that are processed by U.S. depository 
institutions, as well as by U.S. registered brokers or dealers in 
securities. OFAC now is amending Sec.  560.516 to narrow the scope of 
authority provided in paragraph (a) of this section. As amended, 
paragraph (a) of Sec.  560.516 authorizes U.S. depository institutions 
to process transfers of funds to or from Iran, or for the direct or 
indirect benefit of persons in Iran or the Government of Iran, only if 
the transfer meets one of the conditions set forth in the sub-
paragraphs to paragraph (a) and does not involve debiting or crediting 
an Iranian account, as defined in Sec.  560.320 of the ITR. Prior to 
this amendment, sub-paragraph (a)(1) authorized such transactions when 
the transfer was by order of a non-Iranian foreign bank from its own 
account in a domestic bank to an account held by a domestic bank for a 
non-Iranian foreign bank. This is commonly referred to as the ``U-
turn'' authorization. It is so termed because it is initiated offshore 
as a dollar-denominated transaction by order of a foreign bank's 
customer; it then becomes a transfer from a correspondent account held 
by a domestic bank for the foreign bank to a correspondent account held 
by a domestic bank for another foreign bank; and it ends up offshore as 
a transfer to a dollar-denominated account of the second foreign bank's 
customer. OFAC now is narrowing the scope of authority provided by 
paragraph (a) of Sec.  560.516 by deleting sub-paragraph (a)(1) and, 
thereby, revoking the authorization for ``U-turn'' transfers.
    The reasons OFAC is revoking this authorization include the need to 
further protect the U.S. financial system from the threat of illicit 
finance posed by Iran and its banks. This threat was highlighted in 
March of 2008 when the United Nations Security Council adopted 
Resolution 1803, which calls upon all states ``to exercise vigilance 
over the activities of financial institutions in their territories with 
all banks domiciled in Iran...in order to avoid such activities 
contributing to the proliferation [of] sensitive nuclear activities, or 
to the development of nuclear weapon delivery systems * * *.'' 
Moreover, on October 16, 2008, the Financial Action Task Force 
(``FATF''), the world's premier standard-setting body for anti-money 
laundering and counter-terrorist financing (``AML/CFT''), warned for 
the fourth time about the risks posed to the international financial 
system by continuing deficiencies in Iran's AML/CFT regime, and in 
particular emphasized Iran's lack of effort in addressing the risk of 
terrorist financing. The FATF called on all countries to strengthen 
preventive measures to protect their financial systems from the risk.
    As a result of this amendment, effective November 10, 2008, U.S. 
depository institutions no longer will be allowed to process ``U-turn'' 
transfers involving Iran, thereby precluding transfers designed to 
dollarize transactions through the U.S. financial system for the direct 
or indirect benefit of Iranian banks or other persons in Iran or the 
Government of Iran. OFAC is revising and republishing Sec.  560.516 of 
the ITR in its entirety because, in addition to removing sub-paragraph 
(a)(1), OFAC also is amending this section to delete references to 
outdated provisions and make other minor technical changes. OFAC also 
is revising Sec.  560.405 and Sec.  560.532 of the ITR to make certain 
conforming changes by deleting references to outdated provisions.

Public Participation

    Because the amendment of the ITR involves a foreign affairs 
function, the provisions of Executive Order 12866 and the 
Administrative Procedure Act (5 U.S.C. 553) requiring notice of 
proposed rulemaking, opportunity for public participation, and delay in 
effective date, are inapplicable. Because no notice of proposed 
rulemaking is required for this rule, the Regulatory

[[Page 66542]]

Flexibility Act (5 U.S.C. 601-612) does not apply.

Paperwork Reduction Act

    The collections of information related to the ITR are contained in 
31 CFR part 501 (the ``Reporting, Procedures and Penalties 
Regulations''). Pursuant to the Paperwork Reduction Act of 1995 (44 
U.S.C. 3507), those collections of information have been approved by 
the Office of Management and Budget under control number 1505-0164. An 
agency may not conduct or sponsor, and a person is not required to 
respond to, a collection of information unless the collection of 
information displays a valid control number.
