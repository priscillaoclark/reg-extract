SECURITIES AND EXCHANGE COMMISSION

[SEC File No. 270-656, OMB Control No. 3235-0715]


Submission for OMB Review; Comment Request; Extension: Rule 3a71-
6

Upon Written Request, Copies Available From: Securities and Exchange 
Commission, Office of FOIA Services, 100 F Street NE, Washington, DC 
20549-2736.

    Notice is hereby given that pursuant to the Paperwork Reduction Act 
of 1995 (``PRA'') (44 U.S.C. 3501 et seq.), the Securities and Exchange 
Commission (``Commission'') has submitted to the Office of Management 
and Budget (``OMB'') a request for approval of extension of the 
previously approved collection of information provided for in Rule 
3a71-6 (17 CFR 240.3a71-6), under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 
(15 U.S.C. 78a et seq.).
    Rule 3a71-6 provides that non-U.S. security-based swap dealers and 
major security-based swap participants may comply with certain Exchange 
Act requirements via compliance with requirements of a foreign 
financial regulatory system that the Commission has determined by order 
to be comparable to those Exchange Act requirements, taking into 
account the scope and objectives of the relevant foreign requirements, 
and the effectiveness of supervision and enforcement under the foreign 
regulatory regime.
    Requests for substituted compliance may come from parties or groups 
of parties that may rely on substituted compliance, or from foreign 
financial authorities supervising such parties or their security-based 
swap activities. In practice, the Commission continues to expect that 
the greater portion of any such substituted compliance requests will be 
submitted by foreign financial authorities. For purposes of the PRA, 
the Commission continues to estimate that three security-based swap 
dealers or major security-based swap participants will submit 
substituted compliance applications.
    The Commission staff estimates that the total time burden 
associated with Rule 3a71-6 is 240 hours per year and the total cost 
burden associated with Rule 3a71-6 is $350,400 per year.
    An agency may not conduct or sponsor, and a person is not required 
to respond to, a collection of information under the PRA unless it 
displays a currently valid OMB control number.
    The public may view background documentation for this information 
collection at the following website: <a href="http://www.reginfo.gov">www.reginfo.gov</a>. Find this 
particular information collection by selecting ``Currently under 30-day

collection should be sent by August 28, 2024 to (i) <a href="http://www.reginfo.gov/public/do/PRAMain">www.reginfo.gov/public/do/PRAMain</a> and (ii) Austin Gerig, Director/Chief Data Officer,

Assistant Secretary.
