July 8, 2024.
    On April 29, 2024, Cboe BZX Exchange, Inc. (the ``Exchange'' or

proposed rule change to amend its Rule 11.28(a) to add four additional 
Market-on-Close (``MOC'') Cut-Off Times to Cboe Market Close. On May 
13, 2024, the Exchange filed Amendment No. 1, which replaced and 
superseded the proposed rule change as originally filed. The proposed 
rule change, as modified by Amendment No. 1, was published for comment 
in the Federal Register on May 29, 2024.\3\ The Commission has received 
no comments on the proposed rule change, as modified by Amendment No.

publication of notice of the filing of a proposed rule change, or 
within such longer period up to 90 days (i) as the Commission may 
designate if it finds such longer period to be appropriate and 
publishes its reasons for so finding or (ii) as to which the self-
regulatory organization consents, the Commission shall either approve 
the proposed rule change, disapprove the proposed rule change, or 
institute proceedings to determine whether the proposed rule change 
should be disapproved. The 45th day after publication of the notice for 
this proposed rule change is July 12, 2024. The Commission is extending

sufficient time to consider the proposed rule change. Accordingly, the 
Commission, pursuant to Section 19(b)(2) of the Act,\5\ designates 
August 27, 2024, as the date by which the Commission shall either 
approve or disapprove, or institute proceedings to determine whether to 
disapprove, the proposed rule change (File No. SR-CboeBZX-2024-032).
