SECURITIES AND EXCHANGE COMMISSION

[Release No. 34-101397; File No. 10-244]


In the Matter of the Application of Green Impact Exchange, LLC 
for Registration as a National Securities Exchange; Order Instituting 
Proceedings To Determine Whether To Grant or Deny an Application for 
Registration as a National Securities Exchange Under Section 6 of the 
Securities Exchange Act of 1934

October 21, 2024.

I. Introduction

    On May 9, 2024, Green Impact Exchange, LLC (``GIX'') filed with the 
Securities and Exchange Commission (``Commission'') a Form 1 
application (``Form 1'') under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 
(``Act''), seeking registration as a national securities exchange under 
Section 6 of the Act.\1\ Notice of the application was published for 
comment in the Federal Register on July 23, 2024.\2\ The Commission 
received comments on the GIX Form 1,\3\ all expressing support for the 
Form 1.

    \2\ See Securities Exchange Act Release No. 100547 (July 17, 
2024), 89 FR 59795.
    \3\ The public comment file for GIX's Form 1 (File No. 10-244) 
is available on the Commission's website at: <a href="https://www.sec.gov/comments/10-244/10-244.htm">https://www.sec.gov/comments/10-244/10-244.htm</a>.
---------------------------------------------------------------------------

    Section 19(a)(1) of the Act \4\ requires the Commission, within 90 
days of the date of publication of notice of an application for 
registration as a national securities exchange, or such longer period 
as to which the applicant consents, to, by order, grant such 
registration \5\ or institute proceedings to determine whether such 
registration should be denied.\6\ This order is instituting proceedings 
under Section 19(a)(1)(B) of the Act \7\ to determine whether GIX's 
application for registration as a national securities exchange should 
be granted or denied, and provides notice of the grounds for denial 
under consideration by the Commission, as set forth below.

II. Overview of GIX's Form 1

A. Description

    GIX proposes to operate a fully automated electronic trading 
platform for the trading of listed equities and would not maintain a 
physical trading floor. Liquidity would be derived from orders to buy 
and orders to sell submitted to GIX electronically by GIX members from 
remote locations. GIX proposes to have one class of membership open to 
registered broker-dealers. GIX would be wholly owned by its parent 
company, Green Exchange, PBC (``GEPBC'').\8\
---------------------------------------------------------------------------

    \8\ See Exhibit C to GIX's Form 1.
---------------------------------------------------------------------------

    With respect to the listing of securities, GIX proposes to permit 
an operating company whose securities are, or at the time of listing on 
GIX will be, listed on another national securities exchange registered 
with the Commission pursuant to Section 6(a) of the Act (its ``primary 
listing exchange'') to apply to also list those securities on the 
Exchange.\9\ As a condition of

[[Page 85265]]

continuing to dually list its securities on GIX, a company would have 
to at all times continue to be in good standing with its primary 
listing exchange.\10\
---------------------------------------------------------------------------

    \9\ See proposed GIX Rule 14.105(a). GIX's proposed rulebook, 
which includes its proposed Green Governance Standards (as described 
in section III.A. below), may be found in Exhibit B-1 to GIX's Form 
1.
    \10\ See proposed GIX Rule 14.105(b).
---------------------------------------------------------------------------

    A novel feature of GIX's proposed listing standards is that GIX 
would require all companies that list on GIX to comply with its Green 
Governance Standards which, according to GIX, are designed to provide 
investors with access to accountable and enforceable information about 
the quality of a listed company's commitment to sustainable ways of 
doing business.\11\ As proposed, GIX's Green Governance Standards do 
not include fixed targets or a single reporting framework, and 
generally are process or disclosure based.
---------------------------------------------------------------------------

    \11\ See Exhibit H-5 to GIX's Form 1, at 3-4.
---------------------------------------------------------------------------

    GIX proposes to enter into a technology services agreement with 
MEMX Technologies, LLC (``MEMX Technologies'') \12\ to license the 
technology underlying the GIX trading platform (``Agreement'').\13\
---------------------------------------------------------------------------

    \12\ MEMX Technologies is affiliated with MEMX LLC (``MEMX 
Exchange''), a registered national securities exchange. MEMX 
Exchange is not a party to the Agreement. See Exhibit E to GIX's 
Form 1.
    \13\ See infra Section III (discussing the proposed Agreement 
between GIX and MEMX Technologies in greater detail). See also 
Exhibits C and E to GIX's Form 1.
---------------------------------------------------------------------------

    A more detailed description of the manner of operation of GIX's 
proposed system can be found in Exhibit E to GIX's Form 1. Further 
information about GIX's proposed Green Governance Standards can be 
found in Exhibit H-5 to GIX's Form 1. GIX's proposed rulebook, which 
includes the Green Governance Standards, is Exhibit B to GIX's Form 1, 
and the governing documents for GIX and GEPBC can be found in Exhibit A 
and Exhibit C, respectively.

B. Comments on GIX's Form 1

    Commenters principally discuss the benefits that they believe GIX's 
proposed Green Governance Standards would provide. Commenters support 
the transparency and accountability for the sustainability initiatives 
that they believe would be provided through GIX's proposed Green 
Governance Standards.\14\ In particular, some commenters state that the 
proposed listing criteria should prevent ``greenwashing.'' \15\ Another 
commenter states that the transparency and accountability required 
through GIX's proposed Green Governance Standards would ``promote[ ] 
investor protection by providing greater information about each listed 
company and allows easier comparisons across `green' companies leading 
to improved investment decision-making.'' \16\
---------------------------------------------------------------------------

    \14\ See, e.g., letters from Hideto Nishitani, CEO, Virtuous 
Capital, LLC (September 4, 2024) (``Virtuous Capital Letter'') at 1; 
the Green Impact Exchange Advisory Council (August 30, 2024) 
(``GIEAC Letter'') at 2; Andrew Behar, CEO, As You Sow (August 26, 
2024); Steven M. Rothstein, Managing Director, and Jake Rascoff, 
Director, Ceres (August 20, 2024) (``Ceres Letter'') at 2; Marcus 
Hooper, Board Advisor, Sustainable Footprints (August 13, 2024) at 
1; John FX Dolan (July 27, 2024); J.G. Michalowski, SafeRock USA 
(July 30, 2024) (``SafeRock USA Letter'') at 1; Michael Capelli 
(August 8, 2024) at 2.

Mahesh (August 15, 2024).

---------------------------------------------------------------------------

    Additionally, one commenter states that approving the GIX Form 1 
would be consistent with Section 11A of the Act, which, according to 
this commenter, mandates the Commission to assure ``fair competition 
among brokers and dealers, among exchange markets, and between exchange 
markets and markets other than exchange markets.'' \17\ Fair 
competition, in the commenter's view, ``implies minimal barriers to 
entry,'' so the commenter states that ``[a]s long as a proposed entrant 
can demonstrate that it can fulfill a national securities exchange's 
legal obligations under the [Act], then its registration should be 
approved.'' \18\ Another commenter states that approval of GIX's 
application would contribute to investor protection.\19\ A different 
commenter offers specific additions regarding GIX's proposed Green 
Governance Standards, specifically suggesting that GIX: (1) designate 
only the IFRS Sustainability Reporting standards as a reporting 
framework to ensure comparability of information for investors; \20\ 
and (2) incorporate into its listing criteria socially responsible 
practices in line with the OECD Guidelines for Multinational 
Enterprises on Responsible Business Conduct and the UN Guiding 
Principles on Business and Human Rights.\21\

    \20\ In the commenter's view, these standards provide a global 
baseline for sustainability reporting, focusing on decision-useful 
information for investors. See letter from Jen Sisson, CEO, The 
International Corporate Governance Network (September 6, 2024) at 1.
    \21\ See id.
---------------------------------------------------------------------------

    Further, another commenter states that approval of the Form 1 would 
provide ``much-needed competition'' to a listings ``duopoly'' and 
``offer a specialized platform for companies and investors who 
prioritize sustainability and responsible business practices.'' \22\ 
This commenter also states that GIX would ``play a crucial role in 
directing capital toward companies that are genuinely committed to 
sustainable practices.'' \23\

III. Proceedings To Determine Whether To Grant or Deny the Application 
and Grounds for Potential Denial Under Consideration

    As required by Section 19(a)(1)(B) of the Act,\24\ the Commission 
is hereby providing notice of grounds for denial under consideration, 
as set forth below. Institution of such proceedings is appropriate at 
this time in view of the issues raised by the application. Institution 
of proceedings does not indicate that the Commission has reached any 
conclusions with respect to any of the issues involved.
---------------------------------------------------------------------------

    \24\ 15 U.S.C. 78s(a)(1)(B).
---------------------------------------------------------------------------

    Under Section 19(a)(1) of the Act, the Commission shall grant an 
application for registration as a national securities exchange if the 
Commission finds that the requirements of the Act and the rules and 
regulations thereunder with respect to the applicant are satisfied. The 
Commission shall deny such application for registration if it does not 
make such a finding.\25\ Under Section 6(b) of the Act, an exchange 
shall not be registered as a national securities exchange unless the 
Commission determines that it has satisfied the relevant requirements 
of the Act.\26\ In particular, Section 6(b)(1) of the Act requires that 
the Commission determine that an exchange is so organized and has the 
capacity to carry out the purposes of the Act.\27\ In addition, under 
Section 6(b)(3) of the Act, the Commission must determine that the 
rules of the exchange assure a fair representation of its members in 
the selection of its directors and administration of its affairs and 
provide that one or more directors shall be representative of issuers 
and investors and not be associated with a member of the exchange, 
broker or dealer.\28\ Section 6(b)(5) of the Act requires that the 
rules of the exchange be designed, among other things, to prevent 
fraudulent and manipulative acts and practices, to promote just and 
equitable principles of trade, to foster cooperation and coordination 
with persons engaged in regulating, clearing, settling, processing 
information with respect to, and facilitating transactions

[[Page 85266]]

in securities, to remove impediments to and perfect the mechanisms of a 
free and open market and a national market system, and in general to 
protect investors and the public interest.\29\ Finally, under Section 
6(b)(8) of the Act, the Commission must determine that the rules of the 
exchange do not impose any burden on competition that is not necessary 
or appropriate in furtherance of the purposes of Act.\30\

---------------------------------------------------------------------------

A. Proposed Green Governance Standards

    Generally, GIX's proposed Green Governance Standards would require 
the following: (1) establishment of board governance polices and 
processes to reinforce the issuer's ``Green Goals''; \31\ (2) 
identification of stakeholders, classification of them, and evaluation 
of how they may be affected by the issuer's environmental practices; 
\32\ (3) definition of short-, medium-, and long-term goals for 
environmentally sustainable business practices that are materially 
meaningful in light of the listed company's specific business; \33\ (4) 
preparation of a plan reasonably designed to meet the listed company's 
stated environmental goals and disclosure of a summary of such plan; 
\34\ (5) provision of a framework for evaluating the issuer's 
environmental goals and an explanation of the propriety of the selected 
metrics; \35\ (6) disclosure of a summary of the listed company's year-
over-year progress using these metrics; \36\ and (7) implementation of 
a green compliance program and appointment of a corporate officer to 
oversee this program.\37\
---------------------------------------------------------------------------

    \31\ See proposed GIX Rule 14.426(b).
    \32\ See proposed GIX Rule 14.427(b). The proposed term 
``stakeholder'' would mean any entities or individuals that can 
reasonably be expected to be significantly affected by a listed 
company's or prospective listed company's activities, products, or 
services; or whose actions can reasonably be expected to affect the 
ability of the company to implement its strategies or achieve its 
objectives. See proposed GIX Rule 14.425(a)(4). Stakeholders would 
include, but would not be limited to, the following: shareholders; 
employees; customers; suppliers (both direct and indirect); partners 
or joint venture participants; lenders or financers; potential 
customers; city, county or equivalent political subdivisions in 
which the listed company operates directly; regulators; and 
financial analysts and markets. See Supplementary Material .03(b) to 
proposed GIX Rule 14.427. As proposed, stakeholders may also include 
unidentified persons or groups who have interests in the 
preservation of local flora and fauna, specific ecosystems (e.g., 
river basins or wetlands), or shared local natural resources (e.g., 
groundwater) that could be affected by the company's actions. See 
Supplementary Material .03(c) to proposed GIX Rule 14.427.
    \33\ See proposed GIX Rule 14.427(c).
    \34\ See proposed GIX Rule 14.427(d).
    \35\ See proposed GIX Rule 14.426(d).
    \36\ See proposed GIX Rule 14.428(c).
    \37\ See proposed GIX Rules 14.426(c), 14.427(e).
---------------------------------------------------------------------------

    Pursuant to its proposed Green Governance Standards, GIX would 
require the establishment of board governance polices and processes to 
reinforce the issuer's Green Goals.\38\ Specifically, a listed 
company's board would have to: (1) adopt a Green Values statement for 
the company and board; \39\ (2) adopt a charge to the company's board 
and/or appropriate board committee(s) regarding oversight of and 
responsibility for green strategy and the achievement of, and/or 
progress toward, the prospective listed company's Green Goals; (3) 
designate a Chief Sustainability Officer to report to the board or a 
committee of the board; \40\ and (4) direct management to implement a 
generally accepted sustainability reporting framework.\41\ As proposed, 
a ``generally accepted sustainability reporting framework'' is a third-
party designed framework for collecting and reporting data and 
information regarding the listed company's green performance.\42\ GIX 
would recognize the following sustainability reporting frameworks as 
being ``generally accepted'': Task Force for Climate-related Financial 
Disclosure; International Sustainability Standards Board/Sustainability 
Accounting Standards Board; Science-Based Targets Initiative; Global 
Reporting Initiative; CDP (formerly the Carbon Disclosure Project); 
World Economic Forum Stakeholder Capitalism Metrics; and the European 
Union Corporate Sustainability Reporting Directive.\43\ A listed 
company would have to develop and implement policies and procedures for 
itself and standards of conduct for vendors, and contractors of the 
listed company that support the company's Green Values.\44\
---------------------------------------------------------------------------

    \38\ As proposed, ``Green Goals'' are a set of specific and 
measurable goals in line with the company's ``Green Values'' for (i) 
transitioning to a sustainable business model and green business 
practices; (ii) maintaining the listed company's mature green 
business practices; and (iii) evolving or iterating its mature green 
business practices as needed. See proposed GIX Rule 14.427(c)(1). As 
proposed, Green Goals must address three distinct time periods: 
short-term (reasonably achievable within two to four years), medium-
term (reasonably achievable within four to ten years), and long-term 
(reasonably achievable in more than ten years). See id. and 
Supplementary Material .06 to proposed GIX Rule 14.427.
    \39\ As proposed, the board's ``Green Values'' statement would 
guide decision-making at the board and executive levels, establish a 
standard against which the prospective listed company's green 
actions can be assessed, and form the basis for an internal 
framework for evaluating initiatives, plans, and actions by 
leadership, managers, and employees with respect to whether such 
initiatives, plans, and actions take environmental impacts and green 
outcomes into account, and incorporate sustainable and green 
practices to the maximum extent possible. See Supplementary Material 
.02 to proposed GIX Rule 14.426.
    \40\ As proposed, GIX specifies qualifications necessary for a 
Chief Sustainability Officer. See Supplementary Material .04 to 
proposed GIX Rule 14.426. Alternatively, the board may assign green 
responsibilities to core business leaders and describe how such core 
business leaders will report to the board.
    \41\ See proposed GIX Rule 14.426(b). Correspondingly, a listed 
company would have to implement its generally accepted 
sustainability reporting framework as directed by the board. See 
proposed GIX Rule 14.427(g).
    \42\ See Supplementary Material .04(3) to proposed GIX Rule 
14.426.
    \43\ See id. In the future, GIX may designate additional 
frameworks as ``generally accepted.'' See id.
    \44\ See proposed GIX Rule 14.427(e).
---------------------------------------------------------------------------

    A listed company would have to: (1) identify all stakeholders in 
its environmental impact, taking into consideration the customs and 
practices of the company's industry and ordinary business practices; 
(2) document the scope of each stakeholder's perceived interests in 
connection with the company's environmental impacts; (3) classify 
whether the stakeholder's perceived interest(s) is (are) direct, 
indirect, or general; and (4) publish a summary of its initial 
stakeholder analysis on its website either as a standalone page or as a 
component of its annual sustainability report.\45\ The listed company's 
management and board would have to review the stakeholder analysis at 
least annually and publish any updated analysis.\46\
---------------------------------------------------------------------------

    \45\ See proposed GIX Rule 14.427(b). As proposed, a listed 
company may use another generally recognized taxonomy to classify 
stakeholders in lieu of the classification described above, provided 
that the listed company adheres to the requirements for applying 
such generally recognized taxonomy. See Supplementary Material .05 
to proposed GIX Rule 14.427(b).
    \46\ See proposed GIX Rule 14.428(b).
---------------------------------------------------------------------------

    GIX would require a listed company to disclose on the listed 
company's website or in a sustainability report: (1) the listed 
company's short-, medium-, and long-term goals; (2) how the listed 
company defines short-, medium-, and long-term time horizons, and the 
criteria it employs for classifying each Green Goal as short-, medium- 
or long-term; (3) for each Green Goal that establishes quantitative 
targets, whether the listed company relied on science-based target 
setting methodology to determine such quantitative targets; and (4) the 
metrics by which the company will evaluate its progress toward the 
achievement of each of its Green Goals on an ongoing basis.\47\ 
Additionally, GIX would require a company to create a Green Business 
Plan that describes all material aspects of implementing its Green 
Goals. A Green Business Plan would

[[Page 85267]]

have to specifically: identify key resources required for 
implementation; assign responsibility for action to one or more 
executive sponsors; describe material assumptions, timelines, and key 
dependencies; and describe any material contractual arrangements, 
communications, and operational systems to be employed in connection 
with the plan.\48\ A summary of the plan would have to be publicly 
disclosed.\49\
---------------------------------------------------------------------------

    \47\ See proposed GIX Rule 14.427(c)(2).
    \48\ See proposed GIX Rule 14.427(d)(1).
    \49\ See proposed GIX Rule 14.427(d)(2). As proposed, the 
summary must contain sufficient information so as to not be 
materially misleading and provide investors and stakeholders with a 
clear understanding of management's key assumptions, estimates, and 
risks that could materially affect the listed company's achievement 
of its Green Goals. See Supplementary Material .08 to proposed GIX 
Rule 14.427.
---------------------------------------------------------------------------

    GIX would require a listed company to disclose annually in its 
sustainability report: (1) the results of a self-evaluation with 
respect to its Green Goals, assessing whether it is on-track to meet 
its short-term Green Goals; and (2) its year-over-year progress toward 
achieving its Green Goals, as measured by its chosen sustainability 
reporting framework.\50\
---------------------------------------------------------------------------

    \50\ See proposed GIX Rule 14.428(c)(1).
---------------------------------------------------------------------------

    The Commission is evaluating whether the novel proposed Green 
Governance Standards are consistent with Section 6 of the Act, 
including Section 6(b)(1) of the Act,\51\ which requires among other 
things that a national securities exchange be organized and capable of 
complying with its own rules, and Section 6(b)(5) of the Act,\52\ which 
requires, among other things, that the rules of an exchange be designed 
to prevent fraudulent and manipulative acts and practices, promote just 
and equitable principles of trade, foster cooperation and coordination 
with persons engaged in regulating, clearing, settling, processing 
information with respect to, and facilitating transactions in 
securities, remove impediments to and perfect the mechanism of a free 
and open market and a national market system, and in general protect 
investors and the public interest. In Exhibit H-5 to its Form 1, GIX 
states why it believes the various aspects of the proposed Green 
Governance Standards are consistent with Section 6(b)(5) of the Act.
---------------------------------------------------------------------------

    \51\ 15 U.S.C. 78f(b)(1).
    \52\ 15 U.S.C. 78f(b)(5).
---------------------------------------------------------------------------

B. Technology Services Agreement With MEMX Technologies, LLC

    GIX would not own the trading technology and systems (``System'') 
developed by MEMX Technologies LLC, but GIX proposes to enter into the 
Agreement with MEMX Technologies to license the technology underlying 
GIX. Generally, the Agreement would govern (1) the delivery and 
licensing of certain software for operation of the System, (2) the 
development and testing of software necessary for connectivity to other 
GIX and/or third party-developed functions and certain other software 
necessary to support trading on GIX, and (3) the operation of the 
System in an on-premises environment on behalf of the Exchange, 
including certain operational and support services.\53\ GIX represents 
that the Agreement and Service Levels Annex to the Agreement would also 
set forth certain service levels to ensure that GIX can meet its 
Regulation Systems Compliance and Integrity (``Regulation SCI'') 
obligations in light of the contractual relationship between GIX and 
MEMX Technologies.
---------------------------------------------------------------------------

    \53\ See Exhibit E to GIX's Form 1 at 3. Under the terms of the 
Agreement, (1) GIX may request that MEMX Technologies develop and 
implement technology changes that change the operation of the GIX 
System; and (2) GIX is not obligated to agree to, accept, or adopt 
changes to the System that are not essential to the operation of its 
instance of the System. See Exhibit E to GIX's Form 1 at 2-3.
---------------------------------------------------------------------------

    The Commission is evaluating whether the proposed Agreement between 
GIX and MEMX Technologies is consistent with Section 6(b)(1) of the 
Act,\54\ including Regulation SCI thereunder.\55\ The Commission is 
considering whether, under the terms of the Agreement, as described in 
the GIX Form 1, GIX would be so organized and have the capacity to be 
able to carry out the purposes of the Act and to comply and enforce 
compliance by its members and persons associated with its members with 
the Act and the rules thereunder. Specifically, the Commission is 
considering, and requests commenters' views on, whether GIX would be 
capable of exercising sufficient control over the operation of GIX, and 
be sufficiently independent from MEMX Technologies, to enable GIX to 
comply with requirements under the Act and applicable rules, including, 
among other things, Regulation SCI, which requires an SCI entity to 
have written policies and procedures reasonably designed to ensure that 
its SCI systems have levels of capacity, integrity, resilience, 
availability and security adequate to maintain the SCI entity's 
operation capability.\56\
