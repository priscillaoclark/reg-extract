SECURITIES AND EXCHANGE COMMISSION

[SEC File No. 270-777, OMB Control No. 3235-0729]


Submission for OMB Review; Comment Request; Extension: Form N-CEN

Upon Written Request, Copies Available From: Securities and Exchange 
Commission, Office of FOIA Services, 100 F Street NE, Washington, DC 
20549-2736

    Notice is hereby given that, pursuant to the Paperwork Reduction 
Act of 1995 (44 U.S.C. 3501 et seq.), the Securities and Exchange 
Commission (the ``Commission'') has submitted to the Office of 
Management and Budget a request for extension of the previously

approved collection of information discussed below.
    The title for the collection of information is ``Form N-CEN under 
the Investment Company Act of 1940.'' Form N CEN is used to collect 
annual, census-type information for registered funds. Filers must 
submit this report electronically using the Commission's electronic 
filing system ``(EDGAR'') in Extensible Markup Language (``XML'') 
format. The purpose of Form N-CEN is to satisfy the filing and 
disclosure requirements of Section 30 of the Investment Company Act, 
and of rule 30a-1 thereunder.
    We estimate that the average annual hour burden to complete the 
generally applicable items on Form N-CEN response will be 18 hours per 
year. We estimate that the aggregate annual hour burden to complete the 
generally applicable items will be 59,490 hours per year. We therefore 
estimate that filers would have total average annualized paperwork 
related expenses related to complete the generally applicable items of 
$605,520 for reports on Form N-CEN.
    The requirements of this collection of information are mandatory. 
Responses will not be kept confidential. An agency may not conduct or 
sponsor, and a person is not required to respond to a collection of 
information unless it displays a currently valid control number.
    The public may view background documentation for this information 
collection at the following website: <a href="http://www.reginfo.gov">www.reginfo.gov</a>. Find this 
particular information collection by selecting ``Currently under 30-day 
Review--Open for Public Comments'' or by using the search function. 
Written comments and recommendations for the proposed information 
collection should be sent within 30 days of publication of this notice 
by April 29, 2024 to (i) <a href="/cdn-cgi/l/email-protection#4409061c6a0b09066a0b0d16056a1701071b2021372f1b2b22222d272136042b29266a212b346a232b32"><span class="__cf_email__" data-cfemail="92dfd0cabcdddfd0bcdddbc0d3bcc1d7d1cdf6f7e1f9cdfdf4f4fbf1f7e0d2fdfff0bcf7fde2bcf5fde4">[email&#160;protected]</span></a> and

Exchange Commission, c/o John Pezzullo, 100 F Street NE, Washington, DC 
20549, or by sending an email to: <a href="/cdn-cgi/l/email-protection#39696b7866745850555b5641794a5c5a175e564f"><span class="__cf_email__" data-cfemail="cc9c9e8d9381ada5a0aea3b48cbfa9afe2aba3ba">[email&#160;protected]</span></a>.
