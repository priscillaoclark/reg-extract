General License No. 8A. Those authorizations remain in effect, 
including with respect to exports or reexports of food, medicine, 
medical devices, and agricultural commodities intended to respond to 
the COVID-19 pandemic that satisfy the applicable criteria of those 
authorizations.
    Note 2 to General License N. Nothing in this general license 
relieves any person from compliance with the requirements of other

Industry and Security or the Department of State's Directorate of 
Defense Trade Controls.
