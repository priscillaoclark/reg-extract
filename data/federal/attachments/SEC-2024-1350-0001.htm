concluded within 180 days of the date of a publication of the notice of 
filing of the proposed rule change. The Commission may extend the time 
for conclusion of such proceedings for up to 60 days if the Commission 
finds such longer period to be appropriate and publishes its reasons

    The Commission is extending the period for Commission action on the

issues raised by the Proposed Rule Change and to take action on the 
Proposed Rule Change. Accordingly, pursuant to Section 
19(b)(2)(B)(ii)(II) of the Act,\12\ the Commission designates November 
21, 2024, as the date by which the Commission should either approve or 
disapprove the Proposed Rule Change SR-FICC-2024-006.
