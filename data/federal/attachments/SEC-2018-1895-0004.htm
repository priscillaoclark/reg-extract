SECURITIES AND EXCHANGE COMMISSION

[SEC File No. 270-034, OMB Control No. 3235-0034]


Proposed Collection; Comment Request; Extension: Rule 17f-2(a)

Upon Written Request, Copies Available From: Securities and Exchange 
Commission, Office of FOIA Services, 100 F Street NE, Washington, DC 
20549-2736

    Notice is hereby given that pursuant to the Paperwork Reduction Act 
of 1995 (``PRA'') (44 U.S.C. 3501 et seq.), the Securities and Exchange 
Commission (``Commission'') is soliciting comments on the existing 
collection of information provided for in Rule 17f-2(a) (17 CFR 
240.17f-2(a)), under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 (15 U.S.C. 78a 
et seq.). The Commission plans to submit this existing collection of 
information to the Office of Management and Budget (``OMB'') for 
extension and approval.
    Rule 17f-2(a) (Fingerprinting Requirements for Securities 
Professionals) requires that securities professionals be fingerprinted. 
This requirement serves to identify security-risk personnel, to allow 
an employer to make fully informed employment decisions, and to deter 
possible wrongdoers from seeking employment in the securities industry. 
Partners, directors, officers, and employees of exchanges, brokers, 
dealers, transfer agents, and clearing agencies are included.
    The Commission staff estimates that approximately 4,480 respondents 
will submit an aggregate total of 289,780 new fingerprint cards each 
year or approximately 65 fingerprint cards per year per registrant. The 
staff estimates that the average number of hours necessary to complete 
a fingerprint card is one-half hour. Thus, the total estimated annual 
burden is 144,890 hours for all respondents (289,780 times one-half 
hour). The average internal cost of compliance per hour is 
approximately $310. Therefore, the total estimated annual internal cost 
of compliance for all respondents is $44,915,900 (144,890 times $310).
    This rule does not involve the collection of confidential 
information.
    Written comments are invited on: (a) whether the proposed 
collection of information is necessary for the proper performance of 
the functions of the Commission, including whether the information 
shall have practical utility; (b) the accuracy of the Commission's 
estimates of the burden of the proposed collection of information; (c) 
ways to enhance the quality, utility, and clarity of the information 
collected; and (d) ways to minimize the burden of the collection of 
information on respondents, including through the use of automated 
collection techniques or other forms of information technology. 
Consideration will be given to comments and suggestions submitted by 
October 22, 2024.
    An agency may not conduct or sponsor, and a person is not required 
to respond to, a collection of information under the PRA unless it 
displays a currently valid OMB control number.
    Please direct your written comments to: Austin Gerig, Director/
Chief Data Officer, Securities and Exchange Commission, c/o Oluwaseun 
Ajayi, 100 F Street NE, Washington, DC 20549, or send an email to:

Vanessa A. Countryman,
Secretary.
