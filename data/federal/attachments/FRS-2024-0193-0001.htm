Final Approval Under OMB Delegated Authority of the Extension for Three 
Years, Without Revision, of the Following Information Collection

    Collection title: Recordkeeping Guidance Associated with Changes in 
Foreign Investments. Made Pursuant to Regulation K.
    Collection identifier: FR 2064.
    OMB control number: 7100-0109.
    General description of collection: Internationally active U.S. 
banking organizations are expected to maintain adequate internal 
records to allow examiners to review compliance with the investment 
provisions of Regulation K. This recordkeeping guidance is what makes 
up the FR 2064. For each investment made under Subpart A of Regulation 
K, a banking organization investor should maintain internal records 
regarding the type of investment; the amount of the investment; the 
percentage ownership; activities conducted by the company and the legal 
authority for such activities; and whether the investment was made 
under general consent, prior notice, or specific consent authority. 
With respect to investments made under general consent authority, 
information also should be maintained that demonstrates compliance with 
the various limits set out in section 211.9 of Regulation K. These 
records are reviewed by examiners during examinations, allowing the 
examiners to determine a banking organization's compliance with the 
Federal Reserve Act and Subpart A of Regulation K. Monitoring banking 
organizations' international investments also permits the Federal 
Reserve to ensure that banking organizations do not expose themselves 
to undue risk.
    Frequency: On-going.
    Respondents: U.S. banking organizations (member banks, Edge Act and 
agreement corporations, and bank holding companies) that have made a 
foreign investment.
    Total estimated number of respondents: 20.
    Total estimated annual burden hours: 160.
    Current actions: On March 29, 2024, the Board published a notice in 
the Federal Register (89 FR 22147) requesting public comment for 60 
days on the extension, without revision, of the FR 2064. The comment 
period for this notice expired on May 28, 2024. The Board did not 
receive any comments.

    Board of Governors of the Federal Reserve System, July 24, 2024.
Michele Taylor Fennell,
Deputy Associate Secretary of the Board.
