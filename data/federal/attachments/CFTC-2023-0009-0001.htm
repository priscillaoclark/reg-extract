SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION: 
    Title: Practice by Former Members and Employees of the Commission 
(OMB Control No. 3038-0025). This is a request for an extension of a 
currently approved information collection.
    Abstract: Commission Rule 140.735-6 governs the practice before the 
Commission of former members and employees of the Commission and is 
intended to ensure that the Commission is aware of any existing 
conflict of interest. The rule, at 17 CFR 140.735-6(e), requires former 
members and employees who are employed or retained to represent any 
person before the Commission within two years of their separation from 
the CFTC, to file a brief written statement with the Commission's 
Office of the General Counsel. The proposed rule was promulgated 
pursuant to the Commission's rulemaking authority contained in Section 
8a(5) of the Commodity Exchange Act, 7 U.S.C. 12a(5) (1994), as 
amended.
    An agency may not conduct or sponsor, and a person is not required 
to respond to, a collection of information unless it displays a 
currently valid OMB control number.\2\ On November 7, 2022, the 
Commission published in the Federal Register notice of the proposed 
extension of this information collection and provided 60 days for 
public comment on the proposed extension, 87 FR 67022 (``60-Day 
Notice''). The Commission did not receive any comments on the 60-Day 
Notice.

collecting, validating, verifying, processing and disclosing 
information, and adjust/update existing methods to comply with any
