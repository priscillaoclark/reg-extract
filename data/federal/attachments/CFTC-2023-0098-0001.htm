---------------------------------------------------------------------------
3038-0059.

SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION: 
    Title: Part 41 Relating to Security Futures Products (OMB Control 
No. 3038-0059). This is a request for extension of a currently approved 
information collection.
    Abstract: Section 4d(c) of the Commodity Exchange Act (``CEA''), 7 
U.S.C. 6d(c), requires the CFTC to consult with the Securities and 
Exchange Commission (``SEC'') and issue such rules, regulations, or 
orders as are necessary to avoid duplicative or conflicting regulations 
applicable to firms that are fully registered with the SEC as brokers 
or dealers and the CFTC as futures commission merchants, involving 
provisions of the CEA that pertain to the treatment of customer funds. 
The CFTC, jointly with the SEC, issued regulations requiring such 
dually-registered firms to make choices as to how its customers' 
transactions in security futures products will be treated, either as 
securities transactions held in a securities account or as futures 
transactions held in a futures account. How an account is treated is 
important in the unlikely event of the insolvency of the firm. Only 
securities accounts receive insurance protection under provisions of 
the Securities Investor Protection Act. By contrast, only futures 
accounts are subject to the protections provided by the segregation 
requirements of the CEA.
    An agency may not conduct or sponsor, and a person is not required 
to respond to a collection of information unless it displays a 
currently valid OMB control number.\2\ The Federal Register notice with 
a 60-day comment period soliciting comments on this collection of 
information was published on August 9, 2023 (88 FR 53871). The 
Commission did not receive any relevant comments pursuant to the 60-Day 
Notice.
