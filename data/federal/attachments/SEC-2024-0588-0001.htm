(the ``Act''),\1\ and Rule 19b-4 thereunder,\2\ notice is hereby given 
that on April 15, 2024, Cboe BZX Exchange, Inc. (the ``Exchange'' or 
``BZX'') filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission (the

I. Self-Regulatory Organization's Statement of the Terms of Substance 
of the Proposed Rule Change

    Cboe BZX Exchange, Inc. (``BZX'' or the ``Exchange'') is filing 
with the Securities and Exchange Commission (``Commission'' or ``SEC'') 
a proposed rule change to amend Rule 14.11(l) to provide that the 
Exchange may approve a series of Exchange-Traded Fund (``ETF'') Shares 
for listing and/or trading on the Exchange that operates in reliance on 
exemptive relief to Rule 6c-11 under the Investment Company Act of 1940 
(the ``Investment Company Act'') that permits the trust issuing the ETF 
Shares to offer an exchange-traded fund class in addition to classes of 
shares that are not exchange-traded. The text of the proposed rule 
change is provided in Exhibit 5.
    The text of the proposed rule change is also available on the 
Exchange's website (<a href="http://markets.cboe.com/us/equities/regulation/rule_filings/bzx/">http://markets.cboe.com/us/equities/regulation/rule_filings/bzx/</a>), at the Exchange's Office of the Secretary, and at 
the Commission's Public Reference Room.

II. Self-Regulatory Organization's Statement of the Purpose of, and 
Statutory Basis for, the Proposed Rule Change

    In its filing with the Commission, the Exchange included statements 
concerning the purpose of and basis for the proposed rule change and 
discussed any comments it received on the proposed rule change. The 
text of these statements may be examined at the places specified in 
Item IV below. The Exchange has prepared summaries, set forth in 
sections A, B, and C below, of the most significant aspects of such 
statements.

A. Self-Regulatory Organization's Statement of the Purpose of, and 
Statutory Basis for, the Proposed Rule Change

1. Purpose
    The Exchange proposes to amend Rule 14.11(l) to provide that the 
Exchange may approve a series of ETF Shares for listing and/or trading 
on the Exchange where such series operates in reliance on exemptive 
relief to Rule 6c-11 under the Investment Company Act that permits the 
trust issuing the ETF Shares to offer ETF Shares in addition to classes 
of shares that are not exchange-traded (``Multi-class ETF Shares'') of 
an open-end fund. There are numerous applications for exemptive relief 
for Multi-class ETF Shares currently before the Commission.\3\ This 
proposed amendment would provide for the ``generic'' listing and/or 
trading of Multi-class ETF Shares under Rule 14.11(l) on the Exchange 
immediately upon the Commission's applicable order granting exemptive 
relief. This proposal is not intended to amend any other part of Rule 
14.11(l) and the Exchange submits this proposal only to prevent any 
unnecessary delay in listing Multi-Class ETF Shares when and if such 
requests are granted by the Commission.

---------------------------------------------------------------------------

Background
    Starting in 2000, the Commission began granting limited relief for 
The Vanguard Group, Inc. (``Vanguard'') to offer certain index-based 
open-end management investment companies with Multi-class ETF 
Shares.\4\ After this relief was granted, there was limited public 
discourse about Multi-class ETF Shares until 2019, when the prospect of 
providing blanket exemptive relief to Multi-class ETF Shares was 
addressed in the Commission's adoption of Rule 6c-11 under the 
Investment Company Act (the ``ETF Rule'').\5\ The ETF Rule permits ETFs 
that satisfy certain conditions to operate without the expense or delay 
of obtaining an exemptive order. However, the ETF Rule did not provide 
blanket exemptive relief to allow for Multi-class ETF Shares as part of 
the final rule. Instead,

[[Page 35256]]

the Commission concluded that Multi-class ETF Shares should request 
relief through the exemptive application process so that the Commission 
may assess all relevant policy considerations in the context of the 
facts and circumstances of particular applicants. The Exchange adopted 
Rule 14.11(l) \6\ shortly after the implementation of the ETF Rule and, 
because there were no exemptive applications before the Commission, did 
not propose to include any language comparable to what is being 
proposed herein.
---------------------------------------------------------------------------

    \4\ See Vanguard Index Funds, Investment Company Act Release 
Nos. 24680 (Oct. 6, 2000) (notice) and 24789 (Dec. 12, 2000) 
(order). The Commission itself, as opposed to the Commission staff 
acting under delegated authority, considered the original Vanguard 
application and determined that the relief was appropriate in the 
public interest and consistent with the protection of investors and 
the purposes fairly intended by the policy and provisions of the 
Act. In the process of granting the order, the Commission also 
considered and denied a hearing request on the original application, 
as reflected in the final Commission order. See also the Vanguard 
Group, Inc., Investment Company Act Release Nos. 26282 (Dec. 2, 
2003) (notice) and 26317 (Dec. 30, 2003) (order); Vanguard

Amendment No. 2 and Order Granting Accelerated Approval of a 
Proposed Rule Change, as Modified by Amendment No. 2, To Adopt BZX 
Rule 14.11(l) Governing the Listing and Trading of Exchange-Traded 
Fund Shares).
---------------------------------------------------------------------------

    As noted above, a number of applications for exemptive relief to 
permit the applicable fund to offer Multi-class ETF Shares (the 
``Applications'') have been submitted to the Commission starting in 
early 2023. In general, the Applications state that the ability of a 
fund to offer Multi-class ETF Shares, i.e., both a class of mutual fund 
shares (each such class, a ``Mutual Fund class'' and such shares 
``Mutual Fund Shares'') and ETF Shares, could be beneficial to the fund 
and to shareholders of each type of class for various reasons, 
including more efficient portfolio management, better secondary market 
trading opportunities, and cost efficiencies, among others.\7\
---------------------------------------------------------------------------

    \7\ Specifically, the Applicants believe that a Mutual Fund 
class would benefit ETF class shareholders because investor cash 
flows through a Mutual Fund class can be used for efficient 
portfolio rebalancing. To the extent that cash flows come into a 
fund through a Mutual Fund class, a portfolio manager may be able to 
deploy that cash strategically to rebalance the portfolio. Second, 
cash flows through a Mutual Fund class may allow for greater 
creation basket flexibility for creations and redemptions through 
the ETF class, which could promote arbitrage efficiency and smaller 
spreads on the trading of ETF Shares in the secondary market. With 
respect to existing funds, ETF classes would permit investors that 
prefer the ETF structure to gain access to established funds' 
investment strategies. Additionally, the establishment of an ETF 
class as part of an existing fund could lead to cost efficiencies. 
Specifically, in terms of fund expenses, an ETF class could have 
initial and ongoing advantages for its shareholders, where 
shareholders of an ETF class of a fund that already has substantial 
assets could immediately benefit from economies of scale. Finally, 
the tax-free conversion of shares from the Mutual Fund class to the 
ETF class may accelerate the development of an ETF shareholder base. 
Subsequent secondary market transactions by the ETF class 
shareholders could generate greater trading volume, resulting in 
lower trading spreads and/or premiums or discounts in the market 
prices of the ETF Shares to the benefit of ETF shareholders. The 
Applicants also believe that an ETF class would benefit Mutual Fund 
class shareholders because in-kind transactions through the ETF 
class may contribute to lower portfolio transaction costs and 
greater tax efficiency. Additionally, the conversion feature could 
allow Mutual Fund shareholders to convert Mutual Fund Shares for ETF 
Shares without adverse consequences to the Fund by allowing Mutual 
Fund shareholders to convert their shares into the ETF class of the 
same fund rather than redeeming their Mutual Fund Shares and buying 
shares of another ETF. In doing so, the converting shareholder could 
save on transaction costs and potential tax consequences that may 
otherwise be incurred in redeeming their existing shares and buying 
separate ETF Shares. The ETF class would also represent an 
additional distribution channel for a fund that could lead to 
additional asset grown and economies of scale; greater assets under 
management may lead to additional cost efficiencies and an improved 
tax profile for the fund may also assist the competitive position of 
the Fund for attracting prospective shareholders. Last, the class of 
ETF Shares could allow certain investors to engage in more frequent 
trading without disrupting the fund's portfolio.
---------------------------------------------------------------------------

Proposal
    The Exchange proposes to amend Rule 14.11(l)(4) to explicitly 
provide that any series of ETF Shares that is eligible to operate under 
exemptive relief under the Investment Company Act that permits the fund 
to offer a class of ETF Shares in addition to classes of shares that 
are not-exchange traded (i.e., Multi-class ETF Shares) may be approved 
by the Exchange for listing and/or trading (including pursuant to 
unlisted trading privileges) on the Exchange pursuant to Rule 19b-4(e) 
under the Act. The Exchange also proposes to explicitly provide that 
the requirements of any exemptive relief applicable to Multi-class ETF 
Shares must be satisfied by a series of ETF Shares on an initial and 
continued listing basis. Last, the Exchange proposes to amend Rule 
14.11(l)(4)(B)(i)(a) to provide that any series of Multi-class ETF 
Shares that fails to meet the requirements of the applicable exemptive 
relief will be subject to the suspension of trading or removal 
provisions of Rule 14.11(l)(4)(B)(i).
2. Statutory Basis
    The Exchange believes the proposed rule change is consistent with 
Act and the rules and regulations thereunder applicable to the Exchange 
and, in particular, the requirements of Section 6(b) of the Act.\8\ 
Specifically, the Exchange believes the proposed rule change is 
consistent with the Section 6(b)(5) \9\ requirements that the rules of 
an exchange be designed to prevent fraudulent and manipulative acts and 
practices, to promote just and equitable principles of trade, to foster 
cooperation and coordination with persons engaged in regulating, 
clearing, settling, processing information with respect to, and 
facilitating transactions in securities, to remove impediments to and 
perfect the mechanism of a free and open market and a national market 
system, and, in general, to protect investors and the public interest. 
Additionally, the Exchange believes the proposed rule change is 
consistent with the Section 6(b)(5) \10\ requirement that the rules of 
an exchange not be designed to permit unfair discrimination between 
customers, issuers, brokers, or dealers.
---------------------------------------------------------------------------

    \9\ 15 U.S.C. 78f(b)(5).
    \10\ Id.
---------------------------------------------------------------------------

    In particular, the Exchange believes that permitting Multi-class 
ETF Shares to list on the Exchange is consistent with the applicable 
exemptive relief and will help perfect the mechanism of a free and open 
market and, in general, will protect investors and the public interest 
in that it will permit the listing and trading of Multi-class ETF 
Shares, consistent with the applicable exemptive relief, and in a 
manner that will benefit investors. Specifically, the Exchange believes 
that the relief proposed in the Applications and the expected benefits 
of the Multi-class ETF Shares described above would be to the benefit 
of investors. Eliminating any unnecessary delay for Multi-class ETF 
Shares listing on the Exchange will simply help accrue those benefits 
to investors more expeditiously. Further, the Exchange is only 
proposing to amend its rules to allow such a series of Multi-class ETF 
Shares to list on the Exchange pursuant to Rule 14.11(l), a change to 
its rules that will only be meaningful if and when the Commission 
grants such relief to an Applicant. To the extent that the Commission 
does not grant Multi-class ETF Shares relief, the proposed change to 
Rule 14.11(l) will have no impact on series of ETF Shares listed on the 
Exchange.
    The Exchange also believes that amending Rule 14.11(l) to 
explicitly provide that the initial and continued listing standards 
applicable to ETF Shares, including the suspension of trading or 
removal standards, would be applicable to Multi-class ETF Shares 
operating under any applicable exemptive relief, are designed to 
promote transparency and clarity in the Exchange's Rules. The Exchange 
believes that with these changes, Rule 14.11(l)(4) would clearly allow 
for the listing and trading of Multi-class ETF Shares upon the 
Commission's order of exemptive relief.

B. Self-Regulatory Organization's Statement on Burden on Competition

    The Exchange does not believe that the proposed rule change will 
impose any burden on competition that is not

[[Page 35257]]

necessary or appropriate in furtherance of the purposes of the Act. The 
Exchange believes the proposed rule change, by permitting the listing 
and trading of ETF Shares operating under Multi-class ETF Shares 
exemptive relief, would introduce additional competition among various 
ETF products to the benefit of investors.

C. Self-Regulatory Organization's Statement on Comments on the Proposed 
Rule Change Received from Members, Participants, or Others

    The Exchange neither solicited nor received comments on the 
proposed rule change.

III. Date of Effectiveness of the Proposed Rule Change and Timing for 
Commission Action

    Within 45 days of the date of publication of this notice in the 
Federal Register or within such longer period up to 90 days (i) as the 
Commission may designate if it finds such longer period to be 
appropriate and publishes its reasons for so finding or (ii) as to 
which the Exchange consents, the Commission will:
    A. by order approve or disapprove such proposed rule change, or
    B. institute proceedings to determine whether the proposed rule 
change should be disapproved.
