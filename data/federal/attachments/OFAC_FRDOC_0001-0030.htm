Background

    The Kingpin Act became law on December 3, 1999. The Act provides a 
statutory framework for the President to impose sanctions against 
significant foreign narcotics traffickers and their organizations on a 
worldwide basis, with the objective of denying their businesses and 
agents access to the U.S. financial system and to the benefits of trade 
and transactions involving U.S. companies and individuals.
    The Kingpin Act blocks all property and interests in property 
subject to U.S. jurisdiction which are owned or controlled by 
significant foreign narcotics traffickers as identified by the 
President. In addition, the Secretary of the Treasury consults with the 
Attorney General, the Director of the Central Intelligence Agency, the 
Director of the Federal Bureau of Investigation, the Administrator of 
the Drug Enforcement Administration, the Secretary of Defense, the 
Secretary of State, and the Secretary of Homeland Security when 
designating and blocking the property or interests in property, subject 
to U.S. jurisdiction, of persons who are found to be: (1) Materially 
assisting in, or providing financial or technological support for or 
to, or providing goods or services in support of, the international 
narcotics trafficking activities of a person designated pursuant to the 
Kingpin Act; (2) owned, controlled, or directed by, or acting for or on 
behalf of, a person designated pursuant to the Kingpin Act; or (3) 
playing a significant role in international narcotics trafficking.
    On November 13, 2008, OFAC designated an additional seventeen 
entities and twenty-six individuals whose property and interests in 
property are blocked pursuant to section 805(b) of the Foreign 
Narcotics Kingpin Designation Act.
