    Collection title: Recordkeeping and Disclosure Requirements 
Associated with CFPB's Regulation B.
    Collection identifier: FR B.
    OMB control number: 7100-0201.
    General description of collection: The Equal Credit Opportunity Act 
(ECOA) was enacted in 1974 and is implemented by the CFPB's Regulation 
B. The ECOA prohibits discrimination in any aspect of a credit 
transaction because of race, color, religion, national origin, sex, 
marital status, age, receipt of public assistance, or the fact that the 
applicant has in good faith exercised any right under the Consumer 
Credit Protection Act. To aid in implementation of this prohibition, 
the statute and Regulation B subject creditors to various mandatory 
disclosure requirements, notification provisions informing applicants 
of action taken on credit applications, provision of appraisal reports 
in connection with mortgages, credit history reporting, monitoring 
rules, and recordkeeping requirements. The FR B is the Board's 
information collection associated with the CFPB's Regulation B for 
institutions the Board supervises.
    Frequency: Event generated and annually.
    Respondents: Except those that are supervised by the CFPB: state 
member banks, their subsidiaries, subsidiaries of bank holding 
companies, subsidiaries of savings and loan holding companies, U.S. 
branches and agencies of foreign banks (other than federal branches, 
federal agencies, and insured state branches of foreign banks), 
commercial lending companies owned or controlled by foreign banks, and 
organizations operating under section 25 or 25A of the Federal Reserve 
Act (12 U.S.C. 601-604a; 611-631).
    Total estimated number of respondents: 841.
    Total estimated annual burden hours: 81,346.
    Current actions: On July 1, 2024, the Board published a notice in 
the Federal Register (89 FR 54463) requesting public comment for 60 
days on the extension, without revision, of the FR B. The comment 
period for this notice expired on August 30, 2024. The Board did not 
receive any comments.
