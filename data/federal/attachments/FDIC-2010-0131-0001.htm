Currently, the FDIC is soliciting comment concerning the proposed 
extension of OMB approval of its information collection, entitled 
``Community Reinvestment Act,'' OMB Control No. 3064-0092.

    Affected Public: Insured state nonmember banks.
    Estimated Number of Respondents: 5,296.

    Abstract: This submission covers an extension of the FDIC's

obligations under the CRA (12 U.S.C. 2901 et seq.) to evaluate and 
assign ratings to the performance of institutions, in connection with 
helping to meet the credit needs of their communities, including low- 
and moderate-income neighborhoods, consistent with safe and sound 
banking practices. The FDIC uses the information in the examination 
process and in evaluating applications for mergers, branches, and 
certain other corporate activities. Financial institutions maintain and 
provide the information to the Agencies.

    (c) Ways to enhance the quality, utility, and clarity of the
