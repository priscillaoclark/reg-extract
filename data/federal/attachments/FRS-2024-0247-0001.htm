Proposal Under OMB Delegated Authority To Extend for Three Years, With 
Revision, the Following Information Collection

    Collection title: Report of Selected Money Market Rates.
    Collection identifier: FR 2420.
    OMB control number: 7100-0357.
    General description of collection: The FR 2420 is a transaction-
based report that collects daily liability data on federal funds 
purchased, selected borrowings from non-exempt entities, Eurodollar 
transactions, and time deposits and certificates of deposits from (1) 
domestically chartered commercial banks and savings associations that 
have $18 billion or more in total assets as well as those that have 
total assets above $5 billion but less than $18 billion and meet the 
activity threshold, (2) U.S. branches and agencies of foreign banks 
with total third-party assets of $2.5 billion or more, and (3) 
significant banking organizations that are active participants in money 
markets. The FR 2420 also collects daily data on Eurodollar 
transactions from International Banking Facilities (IBFs) of the above-
referenced institutions. The FR 2420 data are used in the publication 
of the Effective Federal Funds Rate and Overnight Bank Funding Rate and 
in analysis of current money market conditions.
    Proposed revisions: The Board proposes to add several fields to the 
FR 2420 reporting form, with supporting information added to the FR 
2420 instructions, to enhance money market monitoring. The Board 
proposes to add Part E to the reporting form to collect information on 
depository institutions' secured borrowings via Federal Home Loan Banks 
(FHLBs) advances with 1 year or less to maturity at origination. An 
additional proposed section of the reporting form, Part F, serves to 
collect information on rates paid by depository institutions for 
certain non-maturity demand deposits by FHLBs. The Board proposes the 
addition of one new item in Part C of the reporting form that would 
denote whether reported time deposits represent brokered transactions. 
The proposed FR 2420 revisions would be effective 12 months after the 
publication of a final notice in the Federal Register, with an 
approximate January 2026 as of date.
    The proposed additions to the FR 2420 align with the Board's 
monetary policy mandate. The proposed additions enhance the Federal 
Reserve's ability to monitor bank funding and money markets, especially 
under changing conditions.
    Domestic banks that are FHLB members rely upon FHLB advances, which 
are loans secured by collateral, as a key source of funding. Short-term 
advances with maturities under one year are a widely used alternative 
to the other wholesale money market sources that are already subject to 
FR 2420 reporting. The Federal Reserve currently lacks the ability to 
monitor advance borrowings by all banks subject to FR 2420 reporting 
with data on the interest rates paid on advances or on dollar volumes 
of borrowings at a higher frequency than quarterly. In addition, the 
Federal Reserve currently lacks the ability to monitor volumes and 
rates for FHLBs' interest-bearing deposits. These deposits represent a 
significant dollar volume as compared to the other unsecured funding 
types currently subject to FR 2420 data collection.

Reporting Form Revisions

    The Board proposes to add items to the FR 2420 reporting form to 
collect information on brokered deposits, short-term FHLB advances, and 
interest-bearing non-maturity deposits placed by FHLBs.
    The Board proposes to add a field to the existing Part C of FR 2420 
to denote which reported time deposits represent brokered transactions.
    The proposed Part E of the reporting form concerns FHLB advances 
with an original maturity of one year or less. The reporting form 
fields in Part E would be similar to other data for term instruments 
reported on the FR 2420. Specifically, covered institutions would be 
required to report the dollar amount, origination date, settlement 
date, maturity date, interest rate, day-count convention, the interest 
rate adjusted for estimated FHLB dividends, whether the advance is 
fixed- or floating-rate, whether the advance is amortizing, and whether 
there are embedded options. For floating-rate advances, the spread, 
reference rate, and reset period would be required. Respondents would 
report on each business day their outstanding FHLB advances with an 
original maturity of one year or less.
    The proposed Part F of the reporting form concerns interest-bearing 
demand deposits from FHLBs. The proposed additional reporting form 
fields in Part F include the dollar amount (i.e., account balance), 
trade date, interest rate, and day-count convention, reported for each 
business day.

Instruction Revisions

    Proposed instruction changes provide guidance to covered 
institutions on how to report the proposed items pertaining to brokered 
deposits, FHLB advances, and deposits by FHLBs. Specific reporting 
instruction sections are included for FHLB advances and demand deposits 
by FHLBs, and related definitions are added to the glossary.
    Proposed additional instructions for time deposits in Part C 
include directions to specify a pre-set value for whether a time 
deposit transaction is brokered or not. Brokered deposits follow the 
existing definition in the FR 2420 glossary. In addition, references to 
London Interbank Offered Rate (LIBOR) among reference rates in Part C 
are removed in the proposed revisions, as the production of U.S. dollar 
LIBOR will have ceased by the proposed implementation date for the 
revisions.
    The instructions regarding FHLB advances in Part E are generally 
consistent with those for other parts of the FR 2420. For FHLB advances 
with under one year to maturity at origination, respondents are 
directed to report the dollar amount of the advance, date on which the 
advance is originated, date on which funds settle, interest rate, 
interest rate adjusted for estimated FHLB dividends received by the 
institution, interest-rate spread for floating-rate advances, and 
maturity date of the advance. The instructions specify pre-set values 
for the interest rate's day-count convention, whether the interest rate 
is fixed or floating, reset period for floating-rate advances, 
reference rate used for floating-rate advances, whether the advance is 
amortizing or non-amortizing, and any embedded options in the advance. 
Institutions are directed to report outstanding advances each business 
day.
    The instructions pertaining to the proposed Part F specify that 
only interest-bearing demand deposits by FHLBs should be reported. The 
term ``demand deposits'' is defined in the glossary. Instructions are 
provided directing institutions to report the dollar amount (i.e., end-
of-day account balance in dollars), trade date, interest rate, and day-
count convention for each business day.
    Frequency: Daily.
    Respondents: Commercial banks, savings associations, U.S. branches 
and agencies of foreign banks, IBFs, and

[[Page 79594]]

significant banking organizations representing entities actively 
participating in the federal funds and/or other money markets.
    Total estimated number of respondents: 277.
    Total estimated change in burden: 14,000.
    Total estimated annual burden hours: 133,825.

    Board of Governors of the Federal Reserve System, September 25, 
2024.
Benjamin W. McDonough,
Deputy Secretary and Ombuds of the Board.
