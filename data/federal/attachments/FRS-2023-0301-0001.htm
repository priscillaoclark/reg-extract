SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION: On June 15, 1984, OMB delegated to the Board 
authority under the Paperwork Reduction Act (PRA) to approve and assign 
OMB control numbers to collections of information conducted or 
sponsored by the Board. In exercising this delegated authority, the 
Board is directed to take every reasonable step to solicit comment. In 
determining whether to approve a collection of information, the Board 
will consider all comments received from the public and other agencies.
    During the comment period for this proposal, a copy of the proposed 
PRA OMB submission, including the draft reporting form and 
instructions, supporting statement (which contains more detail about 
the information collection and burden estimates than this notice), and 
other documentation, will be made available on the Board's public 
website at <a href="https://www.federalreserve.gov/apps/reportingforms/home/review">https://www.federalreserve.gov/apps/reportingforms/home/review</a> or may be requested from the agency clearance officer, whose 
name appears above. Final versions of these documents will be made 
available at <a href="https://www.reginfo.gov/public/do/PRAMain">https://www.reginfo.gov/public/do/PRAMain</a>, if approved.

Request for Comment on Information Collection Proposal

    The Board invites public comment on the following information 
collection, which is being reviewed under authority delegated by the 
OMB under the PRA. Comments are invited on the following:
    a. Whether the proposed collection of information is necessary for 
the proper performance of the Board's functions, including whether the 
information has practical utility;
    b. The accuracy of the Board's estimate of the burden of the 
proposed information collection, including the validity of the 
methodology and assumptions used;
    c. Ways to enhance the quality, utility, and clarity of the 
information to be collected;
    d. Ways to minimize the burden of information collection on 
respondents, including through the use of automated collection 
techniques or other forms of information technology; and
    e. Estimates of capital or startup costs and costs of operation, 
maintenance, and purchase of services to provide information.
    At the end of the comment period, the comments and recommendations 
received will be analyzed to determine the extent to which the Board 
should modify the proposal.

Proposal Under OMB Delegated Authority To Extend for Three Years, With 
Revision, the Following Information Collection

    Collection title: Reporting, Recordkeeping, and Disclosure 
Requirements Associated with Regulation WW.
    Collection identifier: FR WW.
    OMB control number: 7100-0367.
    General description of collection: The Board, Federal Deposit 
Insurance Corporation (FDIC), and Office of the Comptroller of the 
Currency (OCC) (collectively, the agencies) implemented a liquidity 
coverage ratio (LCR) requirement and a net stable funding ratio (NSFR) 
requirement, consistent with the international liquidity standards 
published by the Basel Committee on Banking Supervision (BCBS), for 
large and internationally active banking organizations. For the Board, 
these standards are implemented through Regulation WW--Liquidity Risk 
Measurement, Standards, and Monitoring (12 CFR part 249). The NSFR and 
LCR requirements in Regulation WW apply to certain large state member 
banks, covered depository institution holding companies, and U.S. 
intermediate holding companies of foreign banking organizations, as 
well as covered nonbank companies (together, covered companies). The 
reporting, recordkeeping, and disclosure requirements contained in FR 
WW are used to monitor covered companies' compliance with the LCR and 
NSFR.
    Proposed revisions: The Board proposes to revise the FR WW 
information collection to account for three recordkeeping requirements 
in Regulation WW, contained in sections 249.4(a), 249.22(a)(1), and 
(a)(4), which had not been previously cleared by the Board under the 
PRA. Section 249.4(a) requires covered companies to produce and 
maintain certain records that document the compliance of their 
qualifying master netting agreement with the requirements of section 
249.3, and that establish and document procedures for ensuring that 
these agreements remain compliant with the requirement of the 
regulation. In addition, section 249.22(a)(1) requires covered 
companies to demonstrate their capacity to monetize high-quality liquid 
assets (HQLA) by implementing and maintaining procedures and systems to 
monetize any HQLA in accordance with certain parameters. Moreover, 
section 249.22(a)(4) requires that the covered company implement and 
maintain policies and procedures that determine the composition of its 
eligible HQLA on each calculation date according to certain required 
steps.
    The Board is also utilizing a standard burden calculation 
methodology for the estimated hours per response, which caused a net 
reduction in total burden even though there are three additional 
recordkeeping requirements now being accounted for.
    Frequency: The reporting requirements of the FR WW information 
collection are submitted on an event-generated basis. The recordkeeping 
requirements of the FR WW information collection are both event-
generated and ongoing. The disclosure requirements of the FR WW 
information collection must be met on a quarterly basis (relating to 
the LCR) as well as every second and fourth calendar quarter (relating 
to the NSFR) and must remain publicly

[[Page 84330]]

available for at least five years after the initial disclosure date.
    Respondents: The FR WW panel comprises covered companies, as 
defined above. Certain requirements apply only to covered holding and 
nonbank companies.
    Total estimated number of respondents: 21.
    Total estimated change in burden: (446).
    Total estimated annual burden hours: 2,483.\1\

including more detailed burden estimates, can be found in the OMB
