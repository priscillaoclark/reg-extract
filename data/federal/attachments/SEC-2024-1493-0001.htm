SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION: We are adopting an updated Filer Manual, 
Volume II: ``EDGAR Filing,'' Version 71 (September 2024) and amendments 
to 17 CFR 232.301 (``Rule 301''). The updated Filer Manual is 
incorporated by reference into the Code of Federal Regulations.

I. Background

    The Filer Manual contains information needed for filers to make 
submissions on EDGAR. Filers must comply with the applicable provisions 
of the Filer Manual in order to assure the timely acceptance and 
processing of filings made in electronic format.\1\ Filers must consult 
the Filer Manual in conjunction with our rules governing mandated 
electronic filings when preparing documents for electronic submission.
---------------------------------------------------------------------------

    \1\ See Rule 301 of Regulation S-T.
---------------------------------------------------------------------------

II. EDGAR System Changes and Associated Modifications to Volume II of 
the Filer Manual

    EDGAR is being updated in EDGAR Release 24.3 and corresponding 
amendments to Volume II of the Filer Manual are being made to reflect 
these changes, as described below.\2\
---------------------------------------------------------------------------

    \2\ EDGAR Release 24.2 was deployed on July 1, 2024.
---------------------------------------------------------------------------

Allowance of Co-registrants in a Draft Registration Statement in 
Certain Circumstances

    On January 24, 2024, the SEC adopted rules related to initial 
public offerings by special purpose acquisition companies (``SPACs'') 
and subsequent business combination transactions between SPACs and 
private operating companies (``de-SPAC transactions'').\3\ Under the 
rules, the private operating company in a de-SPAC transaction would be, 
in some instances, a co-registrant for purposes of the registration 
statement filed in connection with the de-SPAC transaction. EDGAR will 
be updated to permit co-registrants in a draft registration submission.
---------------------------------------------------------------------------

    \3\ Special Purpose Acquisition Companies, Shell Companies, and 
Projections, Release No. 33-11265 (Jan. 24, 2024) [89 FR 14158 (Feb. 
26, 2024)].
---------------------------------------------------------------------------

Registered Security-Based Swap Execution Facilities' Chief Compliance 
Officer Reports and Financial Resource Reports Using Inline XBRL

    EDGAR will be updated to allow registered security-based swap 
execution facilities (``SBSEFs'') to file chief compliance officer 
reports and financial resource reports using Inline XBRL. Chief 
compliance officer reports and amendments will be filed as SBSEF-CCO-
RPT and SBSEF-CCO-RPT/A submissions, respectively. Quarterly financial 
resource reports and amendments, and financial resource reports 
pursuant to Commission requests and amendments will be filed

[[Page 84281]]

as SBSEF-FIN-QTR, SBSEF-FIN-QTR/A, SBSEF-FIN-REQ, and SBSEF-FIN-REQ/A 
submissions, respectively.\4\
---------------------------------------------------------------------------

    \4\ Security-Based Swap Execution and Registration and 
Regulation of Security-Based Swap Execution Facilities, Release No. 
34-98845 (Nov. 2, 2023) [88 FR 87156 (Dec. 15, 2023)].
---------------------------------------------------------------------------

Addition of XBRL Taxonomy for Cybersecurity Disclosures

    EDGAR will be updated to allow filers to use the appropriate XBRL 
Taxonomy for cybersecurity disclosures required to be included in Forms 
6-K, 8-K, 10-K, and 20-F (and the variants 10-KT, 10-K/A, 10-KT/A, 20-
F/A, 8-K/A, and 6-K/A).\5\
---------------------------------------------------------------------------

    \5\ Cybersecurity Risk Management, Strategy, Governance, and 
Incident Disclosure, Release No. 33-11216 (July 26, 2023) [88 FR 
51896 (Aug. 4, 2023)].
---------------------------------------------------------------------------

Removal of the Index From Volume II of the EDGAR Filer Manual

    Volume II of the Filer Manual will be updated to remove the Index. 
Filers may continue to use the Table of Contents which links directly 
to chapters and topics, and the document search function of this online 
manual.

III. Amendments to Rule 301 of Regulation S-T

    Along with the adoption of the updated Filer Manual, we are 
amending Rule 301 of Regulation S-T to provide for the incorporation by 
reference into the Code of Federal Regulations of the current 
revisions. This incorporation by reference was approved by the Director 
of the Federal Register in accordance with 5 U.S.C. 552(a) and 1 CFR 
part 51.
    The updated EDGAR Filer Manual is available at <a href="https://www.sec.gov/edgar/filerinformation/current-edgar-filer-manual">https://www.sec.gov/edgar/filerinformation/current-edgar-filer-manual</a>.

IV. Administrative Law Matters

    Because the Filer Manual and rule amendments relate solely to 
agency procedures or practice and do not substantially alter the rights 
and obligations of non-agency parties, publication for notice and 
comment is not required under the Administrative Procedure Act 
(``APA'').\6\ It follows that the amendments do not require analysis 
under requirements of the Regulatory Flexibility Act \7\ or a report to 
Congress under the Small Business Regulatory Enforcement Fairness Act 
of 1996.\8\
---------------------------------------------------------------------------

    \6\ 5 U.S.C. 553(b)(A).
    \7\ 5 U.S.C. 601 through 612.
    \8\ 5 U.S.C. 804(3)(c).
---------------------------------------------------------------------------

    The effective date for the updated Filer Manual and related rule 
amendments is October 22, 2024. In accordance with the APA,\9\ we find 
that there is good cause to establish an effective date less than 30 
days after publication of these rules. The Commission believes that 
establishing an effective date less than 30 days after publication of 
these rules is necessary to coordinate the effectiveness of the updated 
Filer Manual with the related system upgrades.
---------------------------------------------------------------------------

    \9\ 5 U.S.C. 553(d)(3).
---------------------------------------------------------------------------

V. Statutory Basis

    We are adopting the amendments to Regulation S-T under the 
authority in sections 6, 7, 8, 10, and 19(a) of the Securities Act of 
1933,\10\ sections 3, 12, 13, 14, 15, 15B, 23, and 35A of the 
Securities Exchange Act of 1934,\11\ section 319 of the Trust Indenture 
Act of 1939,\12\ and sections 8, 30, 31, and 38 of the Investment 
Company Act of 1940.\13\
---------------------------------------------------------------------------

    \10\ 15 U.S.C. 77f, 77g, 77h, 77j, and 77s(a).
    \11\ 15 U.S.C. 78c, 78l, 78m, 78n, 78o, 78o-4, 78w, and 78ll.
    \12\ 15 U.S.C. 77sss.

set forth in the updated EDGAR Filer Manual, Volume II: ``EDGAR

these requirements in order for documents to be timely received and 
accepted. The EDGAR Filer Manual is available for inspection at the
