SECURITIES AND EXCHANGE COMMISSION

[SEC File No. 270-270, OMB Control No. 3235-0292]


Submission for OMB Review; Comment Request; Extension: Form F-6-
Registration Statement

Upon Written Request Copies Available From: Securities and Exchange 
Commission, Office of FOIA Services, 100 F Street NE, Washington, DC 
20549-2736.

    Notice is hereby given that, pursuant to the Paperwork Reduction 
Act of 1995 (44 U.S.C. 3501 et seq.), the Securities and Exchange 
Commission (``Commission'') has submitted to the Office of Management 
and Budget this request for extension of the previously approved 
collection of information discussed below.
    Form F-6 (17 CFR 239.36) is a form used by foreign companies to 
register the offer and sale of American Depositary Receipts (ADRs) 
under the Securities Act of 1933 (15 U.S.C. 77a et seq.). Form F-6 
requires disclosure of information regarding the terms of the 
depository bank, fees charged, and a description of the ADRs. No 
special information regarding the foreign company is required to be 
prepared or disclosed, although the foreign company must be one which 
periodically furnishes information to the Commission. The information 
is needed to ensure that investors in ADRs have full disclosure of 
information concerning the deposit agreement and the foreign company. 
Form F-6 takes approximately 1.35 hours per response to prepare and is 
filed by 366 respondents annually. We estimate that 25% of the 1.35 
hours per response (0.338 hours) is prepared by the filer for a total 
annual reporting burden of 124 hours (0.338 hours per response x 366 
responses). The information provided on Form F-6 is mandatory to best 
ensure full disclosure of ADRs being issued in the U.S. All information 
provided to the Commission is available for public review upon request.
    An agency may not conduct or sponsor, and a person is not required 
to respond to, a collection of information unless it displays a 
currently valid control number.
    The public may view background documentation for this information 
collection at the following website: <a href="http://www.reginfo.gov">www.reginfo.gov</a>. Find this 
particular information collection by selecting ``Currently under 30-day 
Review--Open for Public Comments'' or by using the search function. 
Written comments and recommendations for the proposed information 
collection should be sent within 30 days of publication of this notice 
by July 29, 2024 to (i) <a href="http://www.reginfo.gov/public/do/PRAMain">www.reginfo.gov/public/do/PRAMain</a> and (ii) 
David Bottom, Director/Chief Information Officer, Securities and 
Exchange Commission, c/o John Pezzullo, 100 F Street NE, Washington, DC 
20549, or by sending an email to: <a href="/cdn-cgi/l/email-protection#d18183908e9cb0b8bdb3bea991a2b4b2ffb6bea7"><span class="__cf_email__" data-cfemail="85d5d7c4dac8e4ece9e7eafdc5f6e0e6abe2eaf3">[email&#160;protected]</span></a>.

    Dated: June 21, 2024.
Vanessa A. Countryman,
Secretary.
