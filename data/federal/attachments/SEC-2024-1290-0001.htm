    On April 5, 2024, FICC filed Partial Amendment No. 1 to the 
proposed rule change to correct errors FICC discovered regarding the 
impact analysis filed as Exhibit 3 and discussed in the filing 
narrative, as well as correct a typo in the methodology formula in 
Exhibit 5b.\7\ The corrections in Partial Amendment No. 1 do not change 
the substance of the proposed rule change.\8\ On May 20, 2024, the 
Commission published notice of Partial Amendment No. 1 and instituted 
proceedings, pursuant to Section 19(b)(2)(B) of the Exchange Act,\9\ to 
determine whether to approve or disapprove the proposed rule change, as 
modified by the Partial Amendment No. 1.\10\
---------------------------------------------------------------------------

    \7\ To promote the public availability and transparency of its 
post-notice partial amendment, FICC submitted a copy of Partial 
Amendment No. 1 through the Commission's electronic public comment 
letter mechanism. Accordingly, Partial Amendment No. 1 has been 
posted to the Commission's website at <a href="https://www.sec.gov/comments/sr-ficc-2024-003/srficc2024003-455611-1167714.pdf">https://www.sec.gov/comments/sr-ficc-2024-003/srficc2024003-455611-1167714.pdf</a> and thus been

confidential treatment pursuant to 17 CFR 240.24b-2 with respect to 
Exhibit 3 and Exhibit 5b.
    \8\ On February 27, 2024, FICC filed the proposed rule change as 
an advance notice with the Commission pursuant to Section 806(e)(1) 
of Title VIII of the Dodd-Frank Wall Street Reform and Consumer 
Protection Act entitled the Payment, Clearing, and Settlement 
Supervision Act of 2010 (``Clearing Supervision Act'') and Rule 19b-
4(n)(1)(i) under the Act. 12 U.S.C. 5465(e)(1); 17 CFR 240.19b-
4(n)(1)(i). Notice of the advance notice was published in the

No. 99712 (March 11, 2024), 89 FR 18981 (March 15, 2024) (SR-FICC-
2024-801). Pursuant to Section 806(e)(1)(H) of the Clearing 
Supervision Act, the Commission extended the review period of the 
advance notice for an additional 60 days after finding that the 
Advance Notice raised novel and complex issues. On March 22, 2024, 
the Commission requested additional information from FICC pursuant 
to Section 806(e)(1)(D) of the Clearing Supervision Act, which 
tolled the Commission's review period of review of the Advance 
Notice. 12 U.S.C. 5465(e)(1)(D). On April 26, 2024, the Commission 
received FICC's response to the Commission's request for additional 
information. On April 5, 2024, FICC filed Partial Amendment No. 1 to 
the advance notice, which makes the same corrections as Partial 
Amendment No. 1 to the proposed rule change. Notice of the advance 
notice, as modified by Partial Amendment No. 1, was published in the 
Federal Register on March 15, 2024. Securities Exchange Act Release 
No. 100140 (May 14, 2024), 89 FR 43941 (May 20, 2024) (SR-FICC-2024-

    Section 19(b)(2) of the Exchange Act \11\ provides that proceedings 
to determine whether to approve or disapprove a proposed rule change 
must be concluded within 180 days of the date of publication of notice 
of filing of the proposed rule change. The time for conclusion of the 
proceedings may be extended for up to 60 days if the Commission

    The Commission is extending the period for Commission action on the 
Proposed Rule Change, as modified by Partial Amendment No. 1. The 
Commission finds that it is appropriate to designate a longer period 
within which to take action on the Proposed Rule Change so that the 
Commission has sufficient time to consider the issues raised by the 
Proposed Rule Change and to take action on the Proposed Rule Change. 
Accordingly, pursuant to Section 19(b)(2)(B)(ii)(II) of the Exchange 
Act,\13\ the Commission designates November 10, 2024, as the date by 
which the Commission should either approve or disapprove the Proposed 
Rule Change SR-FICC-2024-003.
