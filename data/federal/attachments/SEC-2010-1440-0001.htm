SECURITIES AND EXCHANGE COMMISSION

 
Submission for OMB Review; Comment Request

Upon Written Request, Copies Available From: Securities and Exchange 
Commission, Office of Investor Education and Advocacy, Washington, DC 
20549-0213.

Extension:
    Form N-SAR, SEC File No. 270-292, OMB Control No. 3235-0330.

    Notice is hereby given that, pursuant to the Paperwork Reduction 
Act of 1995 (44 U.S.C. 3501 et seq.), the Securities and Exchange 
Commission (the ``Commission'') is soliciting comments on the 
collection of information summarized below. The Commission plans to 
submit this existing collection of information to the Office of 
Management and Budget (``OMB'') for extension and approval.
    Form N-SAR (OMB Control No. 3235-0330, 17 CFR 249.330) is the form 
used by all registered investment companies with the exception of face 
amount certificate companies, to comply with the periodic filing and 
disclosure requirements imposed by Section 30 of the Investment Company 
Act of 1940 (15 U.S.C. 80a-1 et seq.) (``Investment Company Act''), and 
of rules 30a-1 and 30b1-1 thereunder (17 CFR 270.30a-1 and 17 CFR 
270.30b1-1). The information required to be filed with the Commission 
assures the public availability of the information and permits 
verification of compliance with Investment Company Act requirements. 
Registered unit investment trusts are required to provide this 
information on an annual report filed with the Commission on Form N-SAR 
pursuant to rule 30a-1 under the Investment Company Act, and registered 
management investment companies must submit the required information on 
a semi-annual report on Form N-SAR pursuant to rule 30b1-1 under the 
Investment Company Act.
    The Commission estimates that the total number of respondents is 
3,480 and the total annual number of responses is 6,180 ((2,700 
management investment company respondents x 2 responses per year) + 
(780 unit investment trust respondents x 1 response per year)). The 
Commission estimates that each registrant filing a report on Form N-SAR 
would spend, on average, approximately 14.31 hours in preparing and 
filing reports on Form N-SAR and that the total hour burden for all 
filings on Form N-SAR would be 88,436 hours.
    The collection of information under Form N-SAR is mandatory. 
Responses to the collection of information will not be kept 
confidential. An agency may not conduct or sponsor, and a person is not 
required to respond to a collection of information unless it displays a 
currently valid control number.
    Please direct general comments regarding the above information to 
the following persons: (i) Desk Officer for the Securities and Exchange 
Commission, Office of Management and Budget, Room 10102, New Executive 
Office Building, Washington, DC 20503 or send an e-mail to Shagufta 
Ahmed at <A HREF="mailto:Shagufta_Ahmed@omb.eop.gov">Shagufta_Ahmed@omb.eop.gov</A>; and (ii) Charles Boucher, 
Director/CIO, Securities and Exchange Commission, C/O Remi Pavlik-
Simon, 6432 General Green Way, Alexandria, VA 22312; or send an e-mail 
to: <A HREF="mailto:PRA_Mailbox@sec.gov">PRA_Mailbox@sec.gov</A>. Comments must be submitted to OMB within 30 
days of this notice.

    Dated: September 13, 2010.
Florence E. Harmon,
Deputy Secretary.
