SECURITIES AND EXCHANGE COMMISSION

[SEC File No. 270-647, OMB Control No. 3235-0697]


Submission for OMB Review; Comment Request; Extension: Form SD

Upon Written Request Copies Available From: Securities and Exchange 
Commission, Office of FOIA Services, 100 F Street NE, Washington, DC 
20549-2736

    Notice is hereby given that, pursuant to the Paperwork Reduction 
Act of 1995

[[Page 53693]]

(44 U.S.C. 3501 et seq.), the Securities and Exchange Commission 
(``Commission'') has submitted to the Office of Management and Budget 
this request for extension of the previously approved collection of 
information discussed below.
    Form SD (17 CFR 249b-400) is required by Section 13(p) (15 U.S.C. 
78m(p)) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 (15 U.S.C. 78a et seq.) 
(``Exchange Act'') and Rule 13p-1 thereunder (17 CFR 240.13p-1) and is 
filed by issuers to provide disclosures regarding the source and chain 
of custody of certain minerals used in their products. Section 13(p) 
was added by Section 1502 of the Dodd-Frank Wall Street Reform and 
Consumer Protection Act (``Dodd-Frank Act''). We estimate that, when 
used by filers to comply with Section 13(p), Form SD takes 
approximately 480.61265 hours per response to prepare and is filed by 
approximately 1,009 issuers. We estimate that 75% of the 480.61265 
hours per response (360.46 hours) is prepared by the issuer internally 
for a total annual burden of 363,704 hours (360.46 hours per response x 
1,009 responses).
    Form SD is also used by filers to comply with Section 13(q) of the 
Exchange Act (15 U.S.C. 78m(q)) and Rule 13q-1 thereunder (17 CFR 
240.13q-1). Section 13(q) was added by Section 1504 of the Dodd-Frank 
Act. Form SD is used by resource extraction issuers to disclose 
information relating to certain payments made by the issuer, a 
subsidiary of the issuer, or an entity under the control of the issuer, 
to a foreign government or the Federal Government for the purpose of 
the commercial development of oil, natural gas, or minerals. We 
estimate that, when used by filers to comply with Section 13(q), Form 
SD takes approximately 296.9202 hours per response to prepare and is 
filed by approximately 414 issuers. We estimate that 75% of the 
296.9202 hours per response (222.69 hours) is prepared by the issuer 
internally for a total annual burden of 192,194 hours (222.69 hours per 
response x 414 issuers responses).
    For purposes of the Paperwork Reduction Act (``PRA''), we estimate 
that Form SD take approximately 427.1701 hours per response to comply 
with collection information requirements of Sections 13(p) and 13(q) 
under the Exchange Act and is filed by 1,423 issuers. We estimate that 
75% of the 427.1701 of hours per response (320.3775 hours) is prepared 
by the issuer internally for a total annual burden of 455,897 hours 
(320.3775 hours per response x 1,423 issuers). The estimated burden 
hours are made solely for the purposes of the Paperwork Reduction Act 
and are not derived from a comprehensive or even a representative 
survey or study of the costs of Commission rules and forms.
    An agency may not conduct or sponsor, and a person is not required 
to respond to, a collection of information unless it displays a 
currently valid control number.

collection at the following website: <a href="http://www.reginfo.gov">www.reginfo.gov</a>. Find this

Secretary.
