SECURITIES AND EXCHANGE COMMISSION

[SEC File No. 270-348, OMB Control No. 3235-0394]


Submission for OMB Review; Comment Request; Extension: Rule 15g-5

    Upon Written Request, Copies Available From: Securities and 
Exchange Commission, Office of FOIA Services, 100 F Street NE, 
Washington, DC 20549-2736.
    Notice is hereby given that pursuant to the Paperwork Reduction Act 
of 1995 (``PRA'') (44 U.S.C. 3501 et seq.), the Securities and Exchange 
Commission (``Commission'') has submitted to the Office of Management 
and Budget (``OMB'') a request for approval of extension of the 
previously approved collection of information provided for in Rule 15g-
5--Disclosure of Compensation of Associated Persons in Connection with 
Penny Stock Transactions--(17 CFR 240.15g-5) under the Securities 
Exchange Act of 1934 (15 U.S.C. 78a et seq.).
    Rule 15g-5 requires brokers and dealers to disclose to customers 
the amount of compensation to be received by their sales agents in 
connection with penny stock transactions. The purpose of the rule is to 
increase the level of disclosure to investors concerning penny stocks 
generally and specific penny stock transactions.
    The Commission estimates that approximately 170 broker-dealers will 
spend an average of approximately 87 hours annually to comply with the 
rule. Thus, the total time burden is approximately 14,790 burden-hours 
per year.
    Rule 15g-5 contains record retention requirements. Compliance with 
the rule is mandatory.
    An agency may not conduct or sponsor, and a person is not required 
to respond to, a collection of information under the PRA unless it 
displays a currently valid OMB control number.
    The public may view background documentation for this information 
collection at the following website: <a href="http://www.reginfo.gov">www.reginfo.gov</a>. Find this 
particular information collection by selecting ``Currently under 30-day 
Review--Open for Public Comments'' or by using the search function.

collection should be sent by September 18, 2024 to (i) <a href="http://www.reginfo.gov/public/do/PRAMain">www.reginfo.gov/public/do/PRAMain</a> and (ii) Austin Gerig, Director/Chief Data Officer,
