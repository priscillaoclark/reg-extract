Statement of Changes in Beneficial Ownership of Securities

    Upon Written Request Copies Available From: Securities and Exchange 
Commission, Office of FOIA Services, 100 F Street NE, Washington, DC

    Notice is hereby given that, pursuant to the Paperwork Reduction 
Act of 1995 (44 U.S.C. 3501 et seq.), the Securities and Exchange 
Commission (``Commission'') has submitted to the Office of Management 
and Budget this request for extension of the previously approved 
collection of information discussed below.
    Under the Exchange Act of 1934 (15 U.S.C. 78a et seq.) every person 
who is directly or indirectly the beneficial owner of more than 10 
percent of any class of any equity security (other than an exempted 
security) which registered under Section 12 of the Exchange Act (15 
U.S.C. 78l), or who is a director or any officer of the issuer of such 
security (collectively ``insider), must file a statement with the 
Commission reporting their ownership. Form 4 is a statement to disclose 
changes in an insider's ownership of securities. The information is 
used for the purpose of disclosing the equity holdings of insiders of 
reporting companies. Approximately 186,052 insiders file Form 4 
annually and it takes approximately 0.5 hours to prepare for a total of 
93,026 annual burden hours (0.5 hours per response x 93,026 responses).
