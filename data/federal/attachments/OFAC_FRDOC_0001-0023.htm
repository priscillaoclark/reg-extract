of weapons of mass destruction and the means of delivering them.
    Section 1 of the Order blocks, with certain exceptions, all

materially contributing to, the proliferation of weapons of mass 
destruction or their means of delivery (including missiles capable of 
delivering such weapons), including any efforts to manufacture, 
acquire, possess, develop, transport, transfer or use such items, by 
any person or foreign country of proliferation concern; (3) any person 
determined by the Secretary of the Treasury, in consultation with the 
Secretary of State, the Attorney General, and other relevant agencies, 
to have provided, or attempted to provide, financial, material, 
technological or other support for, or goods or services in support of, 
any activity or transaction described in clause (2) above or any person 
whose property and interests in property are blocked pursuant to the 
Order; and (4) any person determined by the Secretary of the Treasury, 
in consultation with the Secretary of State, the Attorney General, and 
other relevant agencies, to be owned or controlled by, or acting or
