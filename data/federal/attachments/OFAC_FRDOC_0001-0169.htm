Background

    The Kingpin Act became law on December 3, 1999. The Kingpin Act 
establishes a program targeting the activities of significant foreign 
narcotics traffickers and their organizations on a worldwide basis. It 
provides a statutory framework for the President to impose sanctions 
against significant foreign narcotics traffickers and their 
organizations on a worldwide basis, with the objective of denying their 
businesses and agents access to the U.S. financial system and the 
benefits of trade and transactions involving U.S. companies and 
individuals.
    On October 13, 2010, the Director of OFAC blocked pending 
investigation five entities whose property and interests in property 
are blocked pursuant to section 806(a)(2) of the Foreign Narcotics 
Kingpin Designation Act.
