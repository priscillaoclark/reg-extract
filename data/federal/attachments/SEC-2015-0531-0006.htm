SECURITIES AND EXCHANGE COMMISSION

[SEC File No. 270-267, OMB Control No. 3235-0272]


Submission for OMB Review; Comment Request; Extension: Rule 11a-2

Upon Written Request, Copies Available From: Securities and Exchange 
Commission, Office of FOIA Services, 100 F Street NE, Washington, DC 
20549-2736

    Notice is hereby given that, pursuant to the Paperwork Reduction 
Act of 1995

[[Page 3960]]

(44 U.S.C. 3501 et seq.), the Securities and Exchange Commission (the 
``Commission'') has submitted to the Office of Management and Budget a 
request for extension of the previously approved collection of 
information discussed below.
    Rule 11a-2 (17 CFR 270.11a-2) under the Investment Company Act of 
1940 (15 U.S.C. 80a-1 et seq.) permits certain registered insurance 
company separate accounts, subject to certain conditions, to make 
exchange offers without prior approval by the Commission of the terms 
of those offers. Rule 11a-2 requires disclosure, in certain 
registration statements filed pursuant to the Securities Act of 1933 
(15 U.S.C. 77a et seq.) of any administrative fee or sales load imposed 
in connection with an exchange offer.
    The Commission staff estimates that 657 registrants are governed by 
Rule 11a-2. Based on this estimate, the total annual burden hours 
associated with the rule is estimated to be 657 hours. The estimated 
burden hours associated with rule 11a-2 has decreased by 19 hours from 
the current allocation of 676 hours. The decrease is due to a decrease 
in the number of registrants. The estimated external cost associated 
with this collection of information continues to be $0. The Commission 
includes the estimated burden of complying with the information 
collection required by Rule 11a-2 in the total number of burden hours 
estimated for completing the relevant registration statements and 
reports the burden of Rule 11a-2 in the separate Paperwork Reduction 
Act (``PRA'') submissions for those registration statements (see the 
separate PRA submissions for Form N-3 (17 CFR 274.11b), Form N-4 (17 
CFR 274.11c) and Form N-6 (17 CFR 274.11d). The Commission is 
requesting a burden of one hour for Rule 11a-2 for administrative 
purposes.
    The estimate of average burden hours is made solely for the 
purposes of the PRA and is not derived from a comprehensive or even a 
representative survey or study of the costs of Commission rules or 
forms. The information collection requirements imposed by Rule 11a-2 
are mandatory. Responses to the collection of information will not be 
kept confidential. An agency may not conduct or sponsor, and a person 
is not required to respond to, a collection of information unless it 
displays a currently valid control number.
    The public may view background documentation for this information 
collection at the following website: <a href="http://www.reginfo.gov">www.reginfo.gov</a>. Find this 
particular information collection by selecting ``Currently under 30-day 
Review--Open for Public Comments'' or by using the search function. 
Written comments and recommendations for the proposed information 
collection should be sent within 30 days of publication of this notice 
by February 21, 2024 to (i) <a href="/cdn-cgi/l/email-protection#622f203a4c2d2f204c2d2b30234c3127213d060711093d0d04040b010710220d0f004c070d124c050d14"><span class="__cf_email__" data-cfemail="4e030c166001030c6001071c0f601d0b0d112a2b3d2511212828272d2b3c0e21232c602b213e60292138">[email&#160;protected]</span></a>
