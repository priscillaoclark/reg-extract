EXPORT-IMPORT BANK

[Public Notice 2022-3033]


Agency Information Collection Activities: Comment Request

AGENCY: Export-Import Bank of the United States.

ACTION: Submission for OMB review and comments request.

-----------------------------------------------------------------------

SUMMARY: The Export-Import Bank of the United States (EXIM Bank), as a 
part of its continuing effort to reduce paperwork and respondent 
burden, invites the public and other Federal Agencies to comment on the 
proposed information collection, as required by the Paperwork Reduction 
Act of 1995.
    The Application for Special Buyer Credit Limit (SBCL) Under Multi-
Buyer Export Credit Insurance Policies is used by policyholders, the 
majority of whom are U.S. small businesses, who export U.S. goods and 
services. This application provides EXIM Bank with the credit 
information on a foreign buyer credit limit request needed to make a 
determination of eligibility for EXIM Bank support in adherence to 
legislatively required reasonable reassurance of repayment and other 
statutory requirements.
    The application can be reviewed at: <a href="https://img.exim.gov/s3fs-public/pub/pending/eib-92-51.pdf">https://img.exim.gov/s3fs-public/pub/pending/eib-92-51.pdf</a>.
    Application for Special Buyer Credit Limit (SBCL) Under Multi-Buyer

DATES: Comments should be received on or before March 24, 2023 to be 
assured of consideration.

ADDRESSES:  Comments may be submitted electronically on 
<a href="http://www.regulations.gov">www.regulations.gov</a> or by mail to Office of Information and Regulatory 
Affairs, 725 17th Street NW, Washington, DC 20038, Attn: OMB 3048-0015.

SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION: 
    Titles and Form Number: EIB 92-51 Application for Special Buyer 
Credit Limit (SBCL) Under Multi-Buyer Export Credit Insurance Policies.
    OMB Number: 3048-0015.
    Type of Review: Regular.
    Need and Use: This application provides EXIM Bank with the credit 
information on a foreign buyer credit limit request needed to make a 
determination of eligibility for EXIM Bank support in adherence to 
legislatively required reasonable reassurance of repayment and other 
statutory requirements.
    The changes to this form are intended to improve the sequence and 
layout of the foreign buyer credit questions and add description of the 
drop-down menus.
    Affected Public: This form affects business entities involved in 
the export of U.S. goods and services. The estimated number of 
respondents and the annual hour burden has been lowered to only count 
the new applicants. The estimate of the overall burden to the public 
has been reduced after considering that EXIM automatically processes 
renewals of Special Buyer Credit Limit requests in the Exim Online 
(EOL) system, and, thus, the renewing policyholders don't have to 
manually complete an application.
    The number of respondents: 2,000.
    Estimated time per respondents: 30 minutes.
    The frequency of response: As needed.
    Annual hour burden: 1,000 total hours.
    Government Expenses:
    Reviewing time per hour: 1 hour.
    Responses per year: 2,000.
    Reviewing time per year: 2,000 hours.
    Average wages per hour: $42.50.
    Average cost per year: (time * wages): $85,000.
    Benefits and overhead: 20%.
    Total Government Cost: $102,000.
