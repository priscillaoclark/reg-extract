SECURITIES AND EXCHANGE COMMISSION

[SEC File No. 270-182, OMB Control No. 3235-0237]


Proposed Collection; Comment Request; Extension: Form N-54A

Upon Written Request, Copies Available From: Securities and Exchange 
Commission, Office of FOIA Services, 100 F Street NE, Washington, DC 
20549-2736.

    Notice is hereby given that, pursuant to the Paperwork Reduction 
Act of 1995 (44 U.S.C. 3501 et seq.), the Securities and Exchange 
Commission (``Commission'') has submitted to the Office of Management 
and Budget a request for extension of the previously approved 
collection of information discussed below.
    Under the Investment Company Act of 1940 (15 U.S.C. 80a-1 et seq.) 
(the ``Investment Company Act''), certain investment companies can 
elect to be regulated as business development companies, as defined in 
Section 2(a)(48) of the Investment Company Act (15 U.S.C. 80a-
2(a)(48)). Under Section 54(a) of the Investment Company Act (15 U.S.C. 
80a-53(a)), any company defined in Section 2(a)(48)(A) and (B) may 
elect to be subject to the provisions of Sections 55 through 65 of the 
Investment Company Act (15 U.S.C. 80a-54 to 80a-64) by filing with the 
Commission a notification of election, if such company has: (1) a class 
of equity securities registered under Section 12 of

[[Page 80361]]

the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 (15 U.S.C. 78a et seq.) (``Exchange 
Act''); or (2) filed a registration statement pursuant to Section 12 of 
the Exchange Act for a class of its equity securities. The Commission 
adopted Form N-54A (17 CFR 274.53) as the form for notification of 
election to be regulated as a business development company.
    The purpose of Form N-54A is to notify the Commission that the 
investment company making the notification elects to be subject to 
Sections 55 through 65 of the Investment Company Act, enabling the 
Commission to administer those provisions of the Investment Company Act 
to such companies.
    The Commission estimates that on average approximately 21 business 
development companies file these notifications each year. Each of those 
business development companies need only make a single filing of Form 
N-54A. The Commission further estimates that this information 
collection imposes a burden of 0.5 hours, resulting in a total annual 
PRA burden of 10.5 hours. Based on the estimated wage rate, the total 
cost to the business development company industry of the hour burden 
for complying with Form N-54A would be approximately $4,462.50.
    The collection of information under Form N-54A is mandatory. The 
information provided by the form is not kept confidential. An agency 
may not conduct or sponsor, and a person is not required to respond to, 
a collection of information unless it displays a currently valid 
control number.
    Written comments are invited on: (a) whether the proposed 
collection of information is necessary for the proper performance of 
the functions of the Commission, including whether the information 
shall have practical utility; (b) the accuracy of the Commission's 
estimate of the burden of the collection of information; (c) ways to 
enhance the quality, utility, and clarity of the information collected; 
and (d) ways to minimize the burden of the collection of information on 
respondents, including through the use of automated collection 
techniques or other forms of information technology. Consideration will 
be given to comments and suggestions submitted by January 16, 2024.
    An agency may not conduct or sponsor, and a person is not required 
to respond to, a collection of information under the PRA unless it 
displays a currently valid OMB control number.
    Please direct your written comments to: David Bottom, Acting 
Director/Chief Information Officer, Securities and Exchange Commission, 
c/o John Pezzullo, 100 F Street NE, Washington, DC 20549 or send an 
email to: <a href="/cdn-cgi/l/email-protection#78282a3927351911141a1700380b1d1b561f170e"><span class="__cf_email__" data-cfemail="124240534d5f737b7e707d6a526177713c757d64">[email&#160;protected]</span></a>.

    Dated: November 14, 2023.
Sherry R. Haywood,
Assistant Secretary.
