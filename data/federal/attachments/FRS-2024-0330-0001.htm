ACTION: Notice of a modified system of records.

SUMMARY: Pursuant to the provisions of the Privacy Act of 1974, notice 
is given that the Board of Governors of the Federal Reserve System 
(Board) proposes to modify an existing system of records entitled 
BGFRS-25, ``FRB--Multi-Rater Feedback Records.'' The modified system of

evaluated and his or her evaluators, analyses of the questionnaires, 
and associated feedback reports.

modified system of records will become effective January 9, 2025, 
without further notice, unless comments dictate otherwise.
    The Office of Management and Budget (OMB), which has oversight 
responsibility under the Privacy Act, requires a 30-day period prior to 
publication in the Federal Register in which to review the system and

SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION: The Board proposes to modify BGFRS-25 to 
reflect a change in the system name, changes to the contractors 
selected to conduct 360 Assessments, and to update the record schedule. 
The Board is modifying this system of records to reflect a change in 
the system name from BGFRS-25, ``FRB--Multi-Rater Feedback Records'' to 
``FRB--360 Assessment Records,'' to better reflect the records 
contained in the system. The Board has also changed the contractors the 
Board has selected to conduct 360 Assessments and is updating the 
system accordingly. In addition, the Board is updating the record 
retention schedule that applies to the records. Rather than retaining 
the records for four years, the Board will now retain records until the 
record is superseded, one year after the evaluated employee separates 
from employment, or three years--whichever occurs first. To reflect 
these changes, the Board is updating the system name, system location, 
the practices for retrieval, and the practices for retention and 
disposal. In addition, the Board is also updating the system manager 
information, adding a link to the Board's general routine uses and 
updating the administrative, technical, and physical safeguards. The 
Board is not amending or establishing any new routine uses.
    The Board is also making technical changes to BGFRS-25 consistent 
with the template laid out in OMB Circular No. A-108. Accordingly, the 
Board has made technical corrections and non-substantive language 
revisions to the following categories: ``Policies and Practices for 
Storage of Records,'' ``Policies and Practices for Retrieval of 
Records,'' ``Policies and Practices for Retention and Disposal of 
Records,'' ``Administrative, Technical and Physical Safeguards,'' 
``Record Access Procedures,'' ``Contesting Record Procedures,'' and 
``Notification Procedures.'' The Board has also created the following 
new fields: ``Security Classification'' and ``History.''

AUTHORITY FOR MAINTENANCE OF THE SYSTEM:
    Sections 10 and 11 of the Federal Reserve Act (12 U.S.C. 244 and 
248).

PURPOSE(S) OF THE SYSTEM:
    These records are collected and maintained to assist the Board in 
administering its personnel functions and improving the management 
skills of its employees.

CATEGORIES OF INDIVIDUALS COVERED BY THE SYSTEM:
    Past and present employees of the Board who have participated in 
the 360 Assessment program.

CATEGORIES OF RECORDS IN THE SYSTEM:
    This system contains 360 Assessment questionnaires completed by the 
individual under evaluation and his or her evaluators, analyses of the 
questionnaires, and feedback reports compiled by the contractor based 
upon the analyses.

RECORD SOURCE CATEGORIES:
    Information is provided by the individual being evaluated and his 
or her evaluators.

ROUTINE USES OF RECORDS MAINTAINED IN THE SYSTEM, INCLUDING CATEGORIES 
OF USERS AND PURPOSES OF SUCH USES:
    General routine uses A, C, D, F, G, H, I, and J apply to this 
system. These general routine uses are located at <a href="https://www.federalreserve.gov/files/SORN-page-general-routine-uses-of-board-systems-of-records.pdf">https://www.federalreserve.gov/files/SORN-page-general-routine-uses-of-board-systems-of-records.pdf</a> and are published in the Federal Register at 83 
FR 43872 at 43873-74 (August 28, 2018). Records may also be used to 
disclose information to an arbitrator to resolve disputes under a 
negotiated grievance procedure or to officials of labor organizations 
recognized under applicable law, regulation, or policy when relevant 
and necessary to their duties of exclusive representation concerning 
personnel policies, practices, and matters affecting working 
conditions.

POLICIES AND PRACTICES FOR STORAGE OF RECORDS:
    Paper records in this system are stored in locked file cabinets 
with access limited to staff with a need to know. Electronic records 
are stored on a secure server with access limited to staff with a need 
to know.

POLICIES AND PRACTICES FOR RETRIEVAL OF RECORDS:
    Records can be retrieved by one or more personal identifiers 
depending on the contractor engaged by the Board for a particular 360 
Assessment. These identifiers may include the name, email address, 
role, and demographic information (age, gender, etc.) of the 
individuals being evaluated and of the individuals performing the 
evaluations.

POLICIES AND PRACTICES FOR RETENTION AND DISPOSAL OF RECORDS:
    All records are retained either until the record is superseded, one 
year after

[[Page 99265]]

the individual under evaluation's separation from employment, or three 
years--whichever occurs first. Longer retention is authorized if 
required for business use.

ADMINISTRATIVE, TECHNICAL, AND PHYSICAL SAFEGUARDS:
    Paper records are secured by lock and key and electronic files are 
stored on secure servers. The system has the ability to track 
individual user actions within the system. The audit and accountability 
controls are based on National Institute of Standards and Technology 
(NIST) and Board standards, which, in turn, are based on applicable 
laws and regulations. The controls assist in detecting security 
violations and performance or other issues in the system. Access to the 
system is restricted to authorized users within the Board who require 
access for official business purposes. Users are classified into 
different roles and common access and usage rights are established for 
each role. User roles are used to delineate between the different types 
of access requirements such that users are restricted to data that is 
required in the performance of their duties. Periodic assessments and 
reviews are conducted to determine whether users still require access, 
have the appropriate role, and whether there have been any unauthorized 
changes.

RECORD ACCESS PROCEDURES:
    The Privacy Act allows individuals the right to access records 
maintained about them in a Board system of records. Your request for 
access must: (1) contain a statement that the request is made pursuant 
to the Privacy Act of 1974; (2) provide either the name of the Board 
system of records expected to contain the record requested or a concise 
description of the system of records; (3) provide the information 
necessary to verify your identity; and (4) provide any other 
information that may assist in the rapid identification of the record 
you seek.
    Current or former Board employees may make a request for access by 
contacting the Board office that maintains the record. The Board 
handles all Privacy Act requests as both a Privacy Act request and as a 
Freedom of Information Act request. The Board does not charge fees to a 
requestor seeking to access or amend his/her Privacy Act records.
    You may submit your Privacy Act request to the--Secretary of the 
Board, Board of Governors of the Federal Reserve System, 20th Street 
and Constitution Avenue NW, Washington, DC 20551.
    You may also submit your Privacy Act request electronically by 
filling out the required information at: <a href="https://foia.federalreserve.gov/">https://foia.federalreserve.gov/</a>.

CONTESTING RECORD PROCEDURES:
    The Privacy Act allows individuals to seek amendment of information 
that is erroneous, irrelevant, untimely, or incomplete and is 
maintained in a system of records that pertains to them. To request an 
amendment to your record, you should clearly mark the request as a 
``Privacy Act Amendment Request.'' You have the burden of proof for 
demonstrating the appropriateness of the requested amendment and you 
must provide relevant and convincing evidence in support of your 
request.
    Your request for amendment must: (1) provide the name of the 
specific Board system of records containing the record you seek to 
amend; (2) identify the specific portion of the record you seek to 
amend; (3) describe the nature of and reasons for each requested 
amendment; (4) explain why you believe the record is not accurate, 
relevant, timely, or complete; and (5) unless you have already done so 
in a related Privacy Act request for access or amendment, provide the 
necessary information to verify your identity.

NOTIFICATION PROCEDURES:
    Same as ``Access procedures'' above. You may also follow this 
procedure in order to request an accounting of previous disclosures of 
records pertaining to you as provided for by 5 U.S.C. 552a(c).

EXEMPTIONS PROMULGATED FOR THE SYSTEM:
    Certain portions of this system of records may be exempted from 5 
U.S.C. 552a(c)(3), (d), (e)(1), (e)(4)(G), (H), and (I), and (f) of the 
Privacy Act pursuant to 5 U.S.C. 552a(k)(5).

HISTORY:
    This SORN was previously published in the Federal Register at 73 FR 
24984 at 25003-04 (May 6, 2008). The SORN was also amended to 
incorporate two new routine uses required by OMB at 83 FR 43872 (August 
28, 2018).
Board of Governors of the Federal Reserve System.

Ann E. Misback,
Secretary of the Board.
