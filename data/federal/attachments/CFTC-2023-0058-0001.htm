SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION:
    Title: Registration under the Commodity Exchange Act (OMB Control 
No. 3038-0072). This is a request for an extension of a currently 
approved information collection.
    Abstract: The information collected under OMB Control No. 3038-0072 
is gathered through the use of forms for registration of swap dealers 
and major swap participants. Swap dealers and major swap participants 
are required by section 4s(a) of the Commodity Exchange Act (``CEA'') 
(7 U.S.C. 6s(a)) to register with the Commission. The CFTC uses various 
forms for registration (and withdrawal therefrom) (the ``Registration 
Forms''). OMB Control No. 3038-0072 applies to the Registration Forms 
for registration of swap dealers and major swap participants,\2\ to the 
alternative method provided under Commission regulations to submission 
of a fingerprint card for foreign natural persons; and to the process 
for requesting cross-border comparability determinations for 
substituted compliance with requirements otherwise applicable to swap 
dealers and major swap participants.
---------------------------------------------------------------------------

    \2\ Forms for registration of futures commission merchants, 
commodity pool operators, commodity trading advisors, retail foreign 
exchange dealers, introducing brokers, associated persons, floor 
traders, and floor brokers are the subject of a separate information 
collection (OMB Control Number 3038-0023).
---------------------------------------------------------------------------

    An agency may not conduct or sponsor, and a person is not required 
to respond to, a collection of information unless it displays a 
currently valid OMB control number.\3\ On April 28, 2023, the 
Commission published in the Federal Register notice of the proposed 
extension of this information collection and provided 60 days for 
public comment on the proposed extension, 88 FR 26279 (``60-Day 
Notice''). The Commission did not receive any comments on the 60-Day 
Notice.
---------------------------------------------------------------------------

    \3\ 44 U.S.C. 3512, 5 CFR 1320.5(b)(2)(i) and 1320.8 (b)(3)(vi).
---------------------------------------------------------------------------

    Burden Statement: The Commission continues to estimate the burden 
for this collection as described below.
    Respondents/Affected Entities: Users of Commission registration 
forms that are swap dealers and major swap participants.
    Estimated number of respondents: 779.
    Estimated average burden hours per respondent: 1.14 hours.
    Estimated total annual burden on respondents: 888 hours.
    Frequency of responses: Periodically.
    There are no capital costs or operating and maintenance costs 
associated with this collection.

(Authority: 44 U.S.C. 3501 et seq.)

    Dated: June 30, 2023.
Robert Sidman,
Deputy Secretary of the Commission.
