SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION: Under the PRA, 44 U.S.C. 3501 et seq., 
Federal agencies must obtain approval from the Office of Management and 
Budget (OMB) for each collection of information they conduct or 
sponsor. ``Collection of Information'' is defined in 44 U.S.C. 3502(3) 
and 5 CFR 1320.3 and includes agency requests or requirements that 
members of the public submit reports, keep records, or provide 
information to a third party. Section 3506(c)(2)(A) of the PRA, 44 
U.S.C. 3506(c)(2)(A), requires Federal agencies to provide a 60-day 
notice in the Federal Register concerning each proposed collection of 
information, including each proposed extension of an existing 
collection of information, before submitting the collection to OMB for 
approval. To comply with this requirement, the CFTC is publishing 
notice of the proposed collection of information listed below. An 
agency may not conduct or sponsor, and a person is not required to 
respond to, a collection of information unless it displays a currently 
valid OMB control number.
    Title: Registration of Foreign Boards of Trade (OMB Control No. 
3038-0101). This is a request for extension of a currently approved 
information collection.
    Abstract: Section 738 of the DoddFrank Act amended section 4(b)(1) 
of the Commodity Exchange Act to provide that the Commission may adopt 
rules and regulations requiring foreign boards of trade (FBOT) that 
wish to provide their members or other participants located in the 
United States with direct access to the FBOT's electronic trading and 
order matching system to register with the Commission. Pursuant to this 
authorization, the CFTC adopted a final rule requiring FBOTs that wish 
to permit trading by direct access to provide certain information to 
the Commission in applications for registration and, once registered, 
to provide certain information to meet quarterly and annual reporting 
requirements. The rule establishes reporting requirements that are 
required by Part 48 of the Commission's regulations and are necessary 
to ensure that FBOTs registered to provide for trading by direct access 
meet statutory and regulatory requirements on an initial and ongoing 
basis.
    With respect to the collection of information, the CFTC invites 
comments on:
    <bullet> Whether the proposed collection of information is 
necessary for the proper performance of the functions of the 
Commission, including whether the information will have a practical 
use;
    <bullet> The accuracy of the Commission's estimate of the burden of 
the proposed collection of information, including the validity of the 
methodology and assumptions used;
    <bullet> Ways to enhance the quality, usefulness, and clarity of 
the information to be collected; and
    <bullet> Ways to minimize the burden of collection of information 
on those who are to respond, including through the use of appropriate 
automated electronic, mechanical, or other technological collection 
techniques or other forms of information technology; e.g., permitting 
electronic submission of responses.
    All comments must be submitted in English, or if not, accompanied 
by an English translation. Comments will be posted as received to 
<a href="https://www.cftc.gov">https://www.cftc.gov</a>. You should submit only information that you wish 
to make available publicly. If you wish the Commission to consider 
information that you believe is exempt from disclosure under the 
Freedom of Information Act, a petition for confidential treatment of 
the exempt information may be submitted according to the procedures 
established in Sec.  145.9 of the Commission's regulations.\1\
---------------------------------------------------------------------------

    \1\ 17 CFR 145.9.
---------------------------------------------------------------------------

    The Commission reserves the right, but shall have no obligation, to 
review, pre-screen, filter, redact, refuse or remove any or all of your 
submission from <a href="https://www.cftc.gov">https://www.cftc.gov</a> that it may deem to be 
inappropriate for publication, such as obscene language. All 
submissions that have been redacted or removed that contain comments on 
the merits of the ICR will be retained in the public comment file and 
will be considered as required under the Administrative Procedure Act 
and other applicable laws, and may be accessible under the Freedom of 
Information Act.
    Burden Statement--Collection 3038-0101--Registration of Foreign 
Boards of Trade (17 CFR part 48). The estimate of the burden for this 
collection for registered FBOTs has been revised. The Commission's 
estimate of the total number of registered FBOTs that are required to 
make reports quarterly and annually has increased from 23 to 24. This 
revision is due to the fact that there are, at present, 24 FBOTs 
registered with the Commission. The respondent burden for this 
collection is estimated to range from two to eight hours per response 
for submission of required reports. These estimates include the time to 
locate, compile, validate, and verify and disclose and to ensure such 
information is maintained. The respondent burden for this collection is 
estimated to be as follows:
    Estimated number of respondents: 24.
    Estimated average burden hours per respondent: 360 and \1/3\ hours.
    Estimated total annual burden on respondents: 8,648 hours.
    Frequency of collection: When a reportable event occurs and 
quarterly and annually for required reports.
    There are no capital costs or operating and maintenance costs 
associated with this collection.

(Authority: 44 U.S.C. 3501 et seq.)

    Dated: January 10, 2023.
Robert Sidman,
Deputy Secretary of the Commission.
