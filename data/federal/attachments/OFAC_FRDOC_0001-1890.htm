DEPARTMENT OF THE TREASURY

Office of Foreign Assets Control

31 CFR Part 515


Cuban Assets Control Regulations

AGENCY: Office of Foreign Assets Control, Treasury.

ACTION: Final rule.

-----------------------------------------------------------------------

SUMMARY: The Department of the Treasury's Office of Foreign Assets 
Control (OFAC) is amending the Cuban Assets Control Regulations (the 
``Regulations'') to further implement elements of the policy announced 
by the Administration on May 16, 2022, to increase support for the 
Cuban people. Among other things, these amendments increase support for 
internet freedom for the Cuban people and independent Cuban private 
sector entrepreneurs by expanding authorizations for internet-based 
services and a range of financial transactions. These amendments also 
include several additional or updated cross references and one updated 
definition.

DATES: This rule is effective May 29, 2024.

FOR FURTHER INFORMATION CONTACT: OFAC: Assistant Director for 
Licensing, 202-622-2480; Assistant Director for Regulatory Affairs, 
202-622-4855; or Assistant Director for Sanctions Compliance & 
Evaluation, 202-622-2490.

SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION:

Electronic Availability

    This document and additional information concerning OFAC are 
available on OFAC's website: <a href="http://www.treas.gov/ofac">www.treas.gov/ofac</a>.

Background

    The Department of the Treasury issued the Cuban Assets Control 
Regulations, 31 CFR part 515 (the ``Regulations''), on July 8, 1963 
under the Trading With the Enemy Act (50 U.S.C. 4301-41). OFAC has 
amended the Regulations on numerous occasions. As with prior 
amendments, OFAC has ensured that these amendments are consistent with 
the Cuban Liberty and Democracy Solidarity (LIBERTAD) Act of 1996, 22 
U.S.C. 6021-6091 and other applicable authorities. Most recently, on 
June 9, 2022, OFAC amended the Regulations to implement certain policy 
measures announced by the Administration on May 16, 2022 to increase 
support for the Cuban people. In this document, OFAC, in consultation 
with the Department of State, is taking additional actions to further 
implement the Administration's Cuba policy measures announced on May 
16, 2022, as set forth in more detail below.
    Internet-Based Services. OFAC is amending Sec.  515.578(a)(1) to 
provide additional examples of authorized services incident to the 
exchange of communications over the internet and to include and expand 
certain services to support the exchange of such communications. For 
example, OFAC's amendment to Sec.  515.578(a)(1) clarifies that cloud-
based services may be exported to Cuba to support the exchange of 
communications over the internet. OFAC is amending Sec.  515.578(a)(2) 
to expand the authorization for services (including training) to 
install, repair, or replace certain items, including by removing the 
requirement that referenced items fall within specific export control 
classification parameters. OFAC is retaining the requirement in Sec.  
515.578(a)(2) that for services (including training) related to any 
items subject to the Export Administration Regulations, 15 CFR parts 
730 through 774, such items must be licensed or otherwise authorized by 
the Department of Commerce for exportation or reexportation to Cuba. 
OFAC is also amending Sec.  515.578(d) and (e) to authorize the export 
or reexport of Cuban-origin software and mobile applications, 
respectively, from the United States to third countries.
    Definition of Independent Private Sector Entrepreneurs. OFAC is 
amending Sec.  515.340 by replacing the term ``self-employed 
individual'' with the term ``independent private sector entrepreneur'' 
and limiting the term to exclude a Cuban national who is a prohibited 
official of the Government of Cuba, as defined in Sec.  515.337, or a 
member of the Cuban Communist Party, as defined in Sec.  515.338. The 
term continues to include self-employed individuals (cuentapropistas), 
such as owners or employees of a private business or a sole 
proprietorship, but the amended definition now also includes 
cooperatives and other private businesses wholly owned by or consisting 
solely of such individuals. OFAC is also amending Sec.  515.340 to 
specify that private businesses or sole proprietorships of up to 100 
employees are covered by the term ``independent private sector 
entrepreneur.'' OFAC is also replacing the term ``independent Cuban 
entrepreneurs'' with ``independent private sector entrepreneurs'' in 
Sec.  515.582, replacing the term ``self-employed individuals'' with 
``independent private sector entrepreneurs'' and adding farms of up to 
100 employees as an example of

[[Page 46324]]

private businesses in Sec.  515.570, and making conforming changes to 
Sec.  515.421.
    U.S. Bank Accounts for Independent Private Sector Entrepreneurs. 
OFAC is amending Sec.  515.584(h) to authorize independent private 
sector entrepreneurs in Cuba, as defined in Sec.  515.340, to maintain 
and use a U.S. bank account to conduct authorized or exempt 
transactions.
    ``U-Turn'' Transactions. OFAC is amending Sec.  515.584(d) to 
reinstate an authorization for ``U-turn'' transactions to help the 
Cuban people, including independent private sector entrepreneurs, by 
facilitating remittances and payments for authorized transactions in 
the Cuban private sector. This amendment allows any banking 
institution, as defined in Sec.  515.314, that is a person subject to 
U.S. jurisdiction to process funds transfers in which Cuba or a Cuban 
national has an interest if the funds transfers originate and terminate 
outside the United States, provided that neither the originator nor the 
beneficiary is a person subject to U.S. jurisdiction. Transactions 
through the U.S. financial system that do not meet these criteria, 
including all transactions where the originator or beneficiary is a 
person subject to U.S. jurisdiction, remain prohibited unless otherwise 
authorized or exempt under the Regulations. OFAC is also amending Sec.  
515.584(e) to authorize the unblocking and return of any transfer that 
would have been authorized pursuant to the reinstated authorization. 
OFAC is making a conforming change by adding a reference to Sec.  
515.584(d) in the note to Sec.  515.209.
    Telecommunications-Related Transactions Reporting Requirements. 
OFAC is amending Sec.  515.542(g) to replace the current fax or mail 
reporting requirement with a requirement to email reports to 
<a href="/cdn-cgi/l/email-protection#135c5552504176637c616753676176726066616a3d747c65"><span class="__cf_email__" data-cfemail="a2ede4e3e1f0c7d2cdd0d6e2d6d0c7c3d1d7d0db8cc5cdd4">[email&#160;protected]</span></a>. OFAC is also adding a sentence to Sec.  
515.542(g) to clarify that the reporting requirement in paragraph (g) 
applies to entities engaging in transactions to provide 
telecommunication services pursuant to paragraph (b), (c), or (d), and 
not banking institutions, as defined in Sec.  515.314, processing 
payments on behalf of such providers.
    Educational Activities. OFAC is amending Sec.  515.565(a) to 
correct a typographical error in the June 9, 2022 amendment to the 
Regulations and restore language in the general license in Sec.  
515.565(a) authorizing transactions beyond the travel-related 
transactions set forth in Sec.  515.560(c).

Public Participation

    Because the Regulations involve a foreign affairs function, the 
provisions of Executive Order 12866 of September 30, 1993, ``Regulatory 
Planning and Review'' (58 FR 51735, October 4, 1993), and the 
Administrative Procedure Act (5 U.S.C. 553) requiring notice of 
proposed rulemaking, opportunity for public participation, and delay in 
effective date are inapplicable. Because no notice of proposed 
rulemaking is required for this rule, the Regulatory Flexibility Act (5 
U.S.C. 601-612) does not apply.

Paperwork Reduction Act

    The collections of information related to the Regulations are 
contained in 31 CFR part 501 (the ``Reporting, Procedures and Penalties 
Regulations'') and Sec.  515.572. Pursuant to the Paperwork Reduction 
Act of 1995 (44 U.S.C. 3507), those collections of information have 
been approved by the Office of Management and Budget under control 
numbers 1505-0164, 1505-0167, and 1505-0168. An agency may not conduct 
or sponsor, and a person is not required to respond to, a collection of 
information unless the collection of information displays a valid 
control number.
