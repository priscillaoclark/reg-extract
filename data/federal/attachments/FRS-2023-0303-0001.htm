Final Approval Under OMB Delegated Authority of the Extension for Three 
Years, With Revision, of the Following Information Collection

    Collection title: Consolidated Holding Company Report of Equity 
Investments in Nonfinancial Companies and the Annual Report of Merchant 
Banking Investments Held for an Extended Period.
    Collection identifier: FR Y-12, FR Y-12A.
    OMB control number: 7100-0300.
    Effective Date: December 31, 2023.
    General description of collection: The FR Y-12 report collects 
information from certain holding companies on their equity investments 
in nonfinancial companies. The FR Y-12A report collects information 
from certain financial holding companies (FHCs) on merchant banking 
investments that they have held for longer than 8 years (or 13 years in 
the case of investments held through a qualifying private equity fund). 
The Board uses the FR Y-12 report to monitor the growth in equity 
investments in nonfinancial companies and their contributions to 
capital, profitability, risk, and volatility. The Board uses the FR Y-
12A report to monitor investments that are approaching the end of their 
applicable holding periods.
    Frequency: Quarterly, semiannually, annually.
    Respondents: Bank holding companies, savings and loan holding 
companies, U.S. intermediate holding companies, and certain FHCs.
    Total estimated number of respondents: 31.
    Total estimated change in burden: 66.
    Total estimated annual burden hours: 2,021. \1\

including more detailed burden estimates, can be found in the OMB 
Supporting Statement posted at <a href="https://www.federalreserve.gov/apps/reportingforms/home/review">https://www.federalreserve.gov/apps/reportingforms/home/review</a>. On the page displayed at the link, you 
can find the OMB Supporting Statement by referencing the collection 
identifier, FR Y-12 and FR Y-12A.
---------------------------------------------------------------------------

    Current actions: On July 19, 2023, the Board published a notice in 
the Federal Register (88 FR 46161) requesting public comment for 60 
days on the extension, with revision, of the FR Y-12 and FR Y-12A. The 
Board proposed to revise the FR Y-12 and FR Y-12A instructions by 
clarifying when respondents should submit their reports when the 
submission deadline falls on a weekend or holiday, modifying and 
clarifying recordkeeping requirements, clarifying the reported amount 
of a firm's aggregate nonfinancial equity investment, clarifying which 
columns are applicable to certain FR Y-12 schedules, and aligning the 
two reports' submission deadlines. The comment period for this notice 
expired on September 18, 2023. The Board did not receive any comments. 
The revisions will be implemented as originally proposed.

    Board of Governors of the Federal Reserve System, November 29, 
2023.
Michele Taylor Fennell,
Deputy Associate Secretary of the Board.
