SECURITIES AND EXCHANGE COMMISSION

[SEC File No. 270-072, OMB Control No. 3235-0076]


Submission for OMB Review; Comment Request; Extension: Regulation 
D (Form D)

Upon Written Request Copies Available From: Securities and Exchange 
Commission, Office of FOIA Services, 100 F Street NE, Washington, DC 
20549-2736

    Notice is hereby given that, pursuant to the Paperwork Reduction 
Act of 1995 (44 U.S.C. 3501 et seq.), the Securities and Exchange 
Commission (``Commission'') has submitted to the Office of Management 
and Budget this request for extension of the previously approved 
collection of information discussed below.
    Form D (17 CFR 239.500) is a notice of sales filed by issuers 
making an offering of securities in reliance on an exemption under 
Regulation D (17 CFR 230.501 et seq.) or Section 4(a)(5) of the 
Securities Act of 1933 (15 U.S.C. 77d(a)(5)). Regulation D sets forth 
rules governing the limited offer and sale of securities without 
Securities Act registration. The purpose of Form D is to collect 
empirical data, which provides a continuing basis for action by the 
Commission either in terms of amending existing rules and regulations 
or proposing new ones. In addition, the Form D allows the Commission to 
elicit information necessary in assessing the effectiveness of 
Regulation D (17 CFR 230.501 et seq.) and Section 4(6) of the 
Securities Act of 1933 (15 U.S.C. 77d(6)) as capital-raising devices 
for all businesses. Form D information is required to obtain or retain 
benefits under Regulation D. Approximately 38,735 issuers file Form D 
and it takes approximately 5 hours per response. We estimate that 25% 
of the 5 hours per response (1.25 hours per response) is prepared by 
the issuer for an annual reporting burden of 48,419 hours (1.25 hours 
per response x 38,735 responses).
    An agency may not conduct or sponsor, and a person is not required 
to respond to, a collection of information unless it displays a 
currently valid control number.
    The public may view background documentation for this information 
collection at the following website: <a href="http://www.reginfo.gov">www.reginfo.gov</a>. Find this 
particular information collection by selecting ``Currently under 30-day 
Review--Open for Public Comments'' or by using the search function. 
Written comments and recommendations for the proposed information 
collection should be sent within 30 days of publication of this notice 
by May 20, 2024 to (i) <a href="http://www.reginfo.gov/public/do/PRAMain">www.reginfo.gov/public/do/PRAMain</a> and (ii) David 
Bottom, Director/Chief Information Officer, Securities and Exchange 
Commission, c/o John Pezzullo, 100 F Street NE, Washington, DC 20549, 
or by sending an email to: <a href="/cdn-cgi/l/email-protection#f7a7a5b6a8ba969e9b95988fb7849294d9909881"><span class="__cf_email__" data-cfemail="bceceefde3f1ddd5d0ded3c4fccfd9df92dbd3ca">[email&#160;protected]</span></a>.

    Dated: April 15, 2024.
Vanessa A. Countryman,
Secretary.
