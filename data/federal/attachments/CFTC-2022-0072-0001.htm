Control No. 3038-0067.

SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION: 
    Title: Part 162--Protection of Consumer Information under the Fair 
Credit Reporting Act (OMB Control No. 3038-0067). This is a request for 
extension of a currently approved information collection.
    Abstract: On July 21, 2010, President Obama signed into law the 
Dodd-Frank Wall Street Reform and Consumer Protection Act (``Dodd-Frank 
Act'').\2\ Title X of the Dodd-Frank Act, which is titled the Consumer 
Financial Protection Act of 2010 (``CFP Act''), amends a number of 
federal consumer protection laws enacted prior to the Dodd-Frank Act 
including, in relevant part, the Fair Credit Reporting Act

[[Page 59065]]

(``FCRA'') \3\ and the Fair and Accurate Credit Transactions Act of 
2003 (``FACT Act'').\4\ Specifically, Section 1088 of the CFP Act sets 
out certain amendments to the FCRA and the FACT Act directing the 
Commission to promulgate regulations that are intended to provide 
privacy protections to certain consumer information held by an entity 
that is subject to the jurisdiction of the Commission.
---------------------------------------------------------------------------

    \2\ Pub. L. 111-203, 124 Stat. 1376 (2010).
    \3\ 15 U.S.C. 1681-1681x.
    \4\ Public Law 108-159, 117 Stat. 1952, 1980 (2003).
---------------------------------------------------------------------------

    Section 1088 amends section 214(b) of the FACT Act--which added 
section 624 to the FCRA in 2003--and directs the Commission to 
implement the provisions of section 624 of the FCRA with respect to 
persons that are subject to the Commission's enforcement jurisdiction. 
Section 624 of the FCRA gives a consumer the right to block affiliates 
of an entity subject to the Commission's jurisdiction from using 
certain information obtained from such entity to make solicitations to 
that consumer (hereinafter referred to as the ``affiliate marketing 
rules'').\5\ Under the affiliate marketing rules, the entities covered 
by the regulations are expected to prepare and provide clear, 
conspicuous and concise opt-out notices to any consumers with whom such 
entities have a pre-existing business relationship. A covered entity 
only has to provide an opt-out notice to the extent that an affiliate 
of the covered entity plans to make a solicitation to any of the 
covered entity's consumers. The purpose of the opt-out notice is to 
provide consumers with the ability to prohibit marketing solicitations 
from affiliate businesses that do not have a pre-existing business 
relationship with the consumers, but that do have access to such 
consumers' nonpublic, personal information. A covered entity is 
required to send opt-out notices at the maximum of once every five 
years.
---------------------------------------------------------------------------

    \5\ The affiliate marketing rules are found in part 162, subpart 
A (Business Affiliate Marketing Rules) of the CFTC's regulations. 17 
CFR part 162, subpart A.
---------------------------------------------------------------------------

    Section 1088 of the CFP Act also amends section 628 of the FCRA and 
mandates that the Commission implement regulations requiring persons 
subject to the Commission's jurisdiction who possess or maintain 
consumer report information in connection with their business 
activities to properly dispose of that information (hereinafter 
referred to as the ``disposal rules'').\6\ Under the disposal rules, 
the entities covered by the regulations are expected to develop and 
implement a written disposal plan with respect to any consumer 
information within such entities' possession. The regulations provide 
that a covered entity develop a written disposal plan that is tailored 
to the size and complexity of such entity's business. The purpose of 
the written disposal plan is to establish a formal plan for the 
disposal of nonpublic, consumer information, which otherwise could be 
illegally confiscated and used by unauthorized third parties. Under the 
rules, a covered entity is required to develop a written disposal plan 
only once, but may subsequently amend such plan from time to time.
---------------------------------------------------------------------------

    \6\ The disposal rules are found in part 162, subpart B 
(Disposal Rules) of the CFTC's regulations. 17 CFR part 162, subpart 
B.
---------------------------------------------------------------------------

    In addition, section 1088 of the CFP Act amended the FCRA by adding 
the CFTC and the Securities and Exchange Commission (``SEC,'' together 
with the CFTC, the ``Commissions'') to the list of federal agencies 
required to jointly prescribe and enforce identity theft red flags 
rules and guidelines and card issuer rules. Thus, the Dodd-Frank Act 
provides for the transfer of rulemaking responsibility and enforcement 
authority to the CFTC and SEC with respect to the entities under their 
respective jurisdiction. Accordingly, the Commissions have issued final 
rules and guidelines (hereinafter referred to as the ``identity theft 
rules'') \7\ to implement new statutory provisions enacted by the CFP 
Act that amend section 615(e) of the FCRA and direct the Commissions to 
prescribe rules requiring entities that are subject to the Commissions' 
jurisdiction to address identity theft. Under the identity theft rules, 
entities covered by the regulation are required to develop and 
implement reasonable policies and procedures to identify, detect, and 
respond to relevant red flags for identity theft that are appropriate 
to the size and complexity of such entity's business and, in the case 
of entities that issue credit or debit cards, to assess the validity 
of, and communicate with cardholders regarding, address changes.\8\ 
They are also required to provide for the continued administration of 
identity theft policies and procedures.
---------------------------------------------------------------------------

    \7\ The CFTC's identity theft rules are found in part 162, 
subpart C (Identity Theft Red Flags) of the CFTC's regulations. 17 
CFR part 162, subpart C.
    \8\ The CFTC understands that CFTC-regulated entities generally 
do not issue credit or debit cards, but instead may partner with 
other entities, such as banks, that issue cards on their behalf. 
These other entities, which are not regulated by the CFTC, are 
already subject to substantially similar change of address 
obligations pursuant to other federal regulators' identity theft red 
flags rules. Therefore, the CFTC does not expect that any CFTC-
regulated entities will be subject to the related information 
collection requirements under the CFTC's identity theft rules.
---------------------------------------------------------------------------

    An agency may not conduct or sponsor, and a person is not required 
to respond to, a collection of information unless it displays a 
currently valid OMB control number. On July 22, 2022, the Commission 
published in the Federal Register notice of the proposed extension of 
this information collection and provided 60 days for public comment on 
the proposed extension, 87 FR 43797 (``60-Day Notice''). The Commission 
did not receive any relevant comments on the 60-Day Notice.
    Burden Statement: The Commission is revising its burden estimate 
for this collection to reflect its estimate of the current number of 
CFTC registrants subject to the requirements of part 162 regulations. 
The respondent burden for this collection is estimated to be as 
follows:
    Estimated Number of Respondents: 4,420.
    Estimated Total Annual Burden Hours: 58,090.
    Frequency of Collection: As applicable.
    There are no capital costs or operating and maintenance costs 
associated with this collection.
    (Authority: 44 U.S.C. 3501 et seq.)

    Dated: September 26, 2022.
Robert Sidman,
Deputy Secretary of the Commission.
