SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION: Pursuant to the Federal Advisory Committee

the public interest to establish this Committee in order to fulfill its 
strategic goal of providing

access to affordable, equitable, and sustainable housing.

Objectives and Duties of the Committee

    The purpose of the Committee is to advise FHFA in the exercise of 
its oversight functions regarding affordable, equitable, and 
sustainable housing, including but not limited to, affordable, 
equitable, and sustainable housing needs, barriers to access, barriers 
to long-term sustainability, and any regulatory, guidance, or policy 
changes that may be necessary or beneficial to expand such housing. The 
Committee will focus on FHFA's regulated entities--Fannie Mae, Freddie 
Mac, and the Federal Home Loan Banks--and their respective roles in 
providing a reliable source of liquidity and funding to support housing 
finance and community investment in the single-family and multifamily 
housing markets.
    The scope of the Committee's activities shall include providing 
information and analysis in support of advice and recommendations to 
FHFA. Each Committee meeting will better inform any or all the 
following: FHFA's policy development, rulemaking, or community and 
public engagement functions as they relate to affordable, equitable, 
and sustainable housing.
    The duties of the Committee are solely advisory and shall extend 
only to its submission of advice and recommendations to FHFA, with 
supporting information and analysis (within the scope of the 
Committee's activities as defined herein), which shall be non-binding 
on FHFA.
    No determinations of fact or policy shall be made by the Committee. 
The Committee shall have no decision-making role, and shall have no 
access to non-public FHFA information, including confidential 
supervisory or other confidential information.

Membership of the Committee

    The FHFA Director shall appoint the members of the Committee. To 
achieve a fairly balanced membership, FHFA shall seek members 
representative of diverse communities, points of view, institution 
asset sizes, and geographical locations, with expertise in affordable, 
sustainable, or equitable housing in single-family and multifamily 
housing. The Committee will include members with expertise, applicable 
to Fannie Mae, Freddie Mac, or the Federal Home Loan Banks, in the 
areas related to the duties and authorities of the Committee, such as: 
(1) fair lending, fair housing, or civil rights; (2) single-family 
lending, servicing, development, mortgages, or capital markets; (3) 
multifamily lending, servicing, development, mortgages, capital 
markets, or investments (i.e. Low-Income Housing Tax Credits); (4) 
consumer, tenant, or community advocacy; (5) market technology; (6) 
state, local, or tribal government housing policies and programs; and 
(7) academic or non-academic affiliated housing research.
    The Committee shall consist of approximately 20 members, serving 
two-year terms. Members shall serve at the sole discretion of the 
Director.
    The Committee shall meet at such intervals as are required to carry 
out its functions. It is estimated that the Committee will meet at 
least twice per year. Generally, Committee meetings will be open to the 
public.
    Applications and nominations for membership on the Committee will 
be solicited in a subsequent notice in the Federal Register.

Sandra L. Thompson,
Director, Federal Housing Finance Agency.
