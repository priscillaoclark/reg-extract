Agency Information Collection Activities: Comment Request

AGENCY: Export-Import Bank of the United States.

ACTION: New Submission for OMB review and comments request.

-----------------------------------------------------------------------

    Form Title: EIB 15-04 Exporter's Certificate for Co-Financed 
Guarantee & MT Insurance Programs.

SUMMARY: The Export-Import Bank of the United States (EXIM Bank), as 
part of its continuing effort to reduce paperwork and respondent 
burden, invites the general public and other Federal Agencies to 
comment on the proposed information collection, as required by the 
Paperwork Reduction Act of 1995.
    EXIM Bank's borrowers, financial institution policy holders and 
guaranteed lenders provide this form to U.S. exporters, who certify to 
the eligibility of their exports for EXIM Bank support. For direct 
loans and loan guarantees, the completed form is required to be 
submitted at time of disbursement and held by either the guaranteed 
lender or EXIM Bank. For MT insurance, the completed forms are held by 
the financial institution, only to be submitted to EXIM Bank in the 
event of a claim filing.
    EXIM Bank uses the referenced form to obtain information from 
exporters regarding the export transaction and content sourcing. These 
details are necessary to determine the value and legitimacy of EXIM 
Bank financing support and claims submitted. It also provides the 
financial institutions a check on the export transaction's eligibility 
at the time it is fulfilling a financing request.
    The information collection tool can be reviewed at: <a href="https://www.exim.gov/sites/default/files/pub/pending/eib15-04.pdf">https://www.exim.gov/sites/default/files/pub/pending/eib15-04.pdf</a>.
