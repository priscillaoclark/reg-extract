EXPORT-IMPORT BANK

[Public Notice: 2021-6042]


Agency Information Collection Activities: Comment Request

AGENCY: Export-Import Bank of the United States.

ACTION: Submission for OMB review and comments request.

-----------------------------------------------------------------------

SUMMARY: The Export-Import Bank of the United States (EXIM), as part of 
its continuing effort to reduce paperwork and respondent burden, 
invites the general public and other Federal Agencies to comment on the 
proposed information collection, as required by the Paperwork Reduction 
Act of 1995. EXIM's borrowers, financial institution policy holders and 
guaranteed lenders provide this form to U.S. exporters, who certify to 
the eligibility of their exports for EXIM support. For direct loans and 
loan guarantees, the completed form is required to be submitted at time 
of disbursement and held by either the guaranteed lender or EXIM. For 
MT insurance, the completed forms are held by the financial 
institution, only to be submitted to EXIM in the event of a claim 
filing. EXIM uses the referenced form to obtain information from 
exporters regarding the export transaction and content sourcing. These 
details are necessary to determine the value and legitimacy of EXIM 
financing support and claims submitted. It also provides the financial 
institutions a check on the export transaction's eligibility at the 
time it is fulfilling a financing request.

DATES: Comments must be received on or before March 16, 2022 to be 
assured of consideration.

ADDRESSES: Comments may be submitted electronically on 
WWW.REGULATIONS.GOV (EIB 21-02) or by email to Donna Schneider
