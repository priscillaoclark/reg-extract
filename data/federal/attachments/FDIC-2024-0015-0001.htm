    General Description of Collection: Part 382 of the FDIC regulations 
(part 382) is necessary to give effect to such cross-default 
restrictions in the International Swaps and Derivatives Association, 
Inc. (ISDA) 2015 Universal Resolution Stay Protocol (ISDA Protocol). 
Part 382 requires that FDIC-supervised institutions that are 
subsidiaries of global systemically important banks (GSIBs) and their 
counterparties either adhere to the ISDA Protocol or take the 
prescribed steps to amend the contractual provisions of their Qualified 
Financial Contracts (QFCs), consistent with the requirements in the 
rule, within a specified period of time. If such institutions elect to 
amend their QFCs in lieu of adhering to the ISDA Protocol, they must 
seek the FDIC's approval of the proposed amendments, giving rise to 
this information collection. The information collection is necessary to 
ensure QFCs are amended in compliance with part 382. The rule applies 
to FDIC-supervised institutions that are subsidiaries of GSIBs and sets 
forth requirements parallel to those contained in similar rules 
recently published by the Federal Reserve Board and the Office of the 
Comptroller of the Currency with regard to entities they supervise to 
ensure consistent regulatory treatment of QFCs among the various 
entities within a GSIB group.
    There is no change in the methodology or substance of this 
information collection. The total estimated annual burden for this 
information collection is 10 hours, which is a decrease of 10 hours 
from the 2021 information collection submission (20 hours). This 
decrease is a result of a reduction in the estimated annual number of 
respondents because of the automation and standardization of business 
processes.
    2. Title: Industrial Banks and Industrial Loan Companies.
    OMB Number: 3064-0213.
    Forms: None.
    Affected Public: Insured state nonmember banks and state savings 
associations.

    Total Annual Burden (Hours)....  .....................  ..............  ..............  .........        401
----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

    General Description of Collection: Part 354 of the FDIC regulations 
(part 354) establishes filing requirements for industrial banks or 
industrial loan companies (ILCs) and companies that are not subject to 
Federal consolidated supervision by the Federal Reserve Board but 
control an industrial bank or an ILC (covered company). Specifically, 
part 354 requires any covered company and industrial bank or ILC 
subsidiary of a covered company to enter into one or more written 
agreements with the FDIC. However, the requirements under part 354 do 
not apply to any industrial bank subsidiaries of covered companies that 
were subsidiaries of covered companies prior to the effective date of 
part 354--April 1, 2021. The requirements under part 354 give rise to 
this information collection.
    There is no change in the methodology or substance of this 
information collection. The total estimated annual burden for this 
information collection is 401 hours, which is a decrease of 56 hours 
from the 2021 information collection submission (457 hours). This 
decrease is a result of a reduction in the estimated annual number of 
respondents.
