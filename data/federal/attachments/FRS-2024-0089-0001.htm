Proposal Under OMB Delegated Authority To Extend for Three Years, 
Without Revision, the Following Information Collection

    Collection title: Recordkeeping Guidance Associated with Changes in 
Foreign Investments Made Pursuant to Regulation K.
    Collection identifier: FR 2064.
    OMB control number: 7100-0109.
    General description of collection: Internationally active U.S. 
banking organizations are expected to maintain adequate internal 
records to allow examiners to review compliance with the investment 
provisions of Regulation K. This recordkeeping guidance is what makes 
up the FR 2064. For each investment made under subpart A of Regulation 
K, a banking organization investor should maintain internal records 
regarding the type of investment; the amount of the investment; the 
percentage ownership; activities conducted by the company and the legal 
authority for such activities; and whether the investment was made 
under general consent, prior notice, or specific consent authority. 
With respect to investments made under general consent authority, 
information also should be maintained that

demonstrates compliance with the various limits set out in section 
211.9 of Regulation K. These records are reviewed by examiners during 
examinations, allowing the examiners to determine a banking 
organization's compliance with the Federal Reserve Act and subpart A of 
Regulation K. Monitoring banking organizations' international 
investments also permits the Federal Reserve to ensure that banking 
organizations do not expose themselves to undue risk.
    Frequency: On-going.
    Respondents: U.S. banking organizations (member banks, Edge Act and 
agreement corporations, and bank holding companies) that have made a 
foreign investment.
    Total estimated number of respondents: 20.
    Total estimated annual burden hours: 160.

    Board of Governors of the Federal Reserve System, March 26, 
2024.
Ann Misback,
Secretary of the Board.
