NATIONAL LABOR RELATIONS BOARD


Privacy Act of 1974; System of Records

AGENCY: National Labor Relations Board (NLRB).

ACTION: Notice of a modified system of records and rescindment of 
systems of records notices.

-----------------------------------------------------------------------

SUMMARY: Pursuant to the provisions of the Privacy Act of 1974, the 
National Labor Relations Board (``NLRB'' or ``Agency'') publishes this 
notice of a modified system of records entitled Next Generation Case 
Management System (NxGen) (NLRB-33), which includes records from twelve 
systems of records that are no longer being maintained, and so those 
twelve systems of records notices are being rescinded. NxGen, an 
electronic case tracking system, permits the accurate and timely 
collection, retrieval, and retention of information maintained by 
offices of the Agency regarding those offices' handling of matters 
before them, including unfair labor practice and representation cases. 
This notice also includes the rescindment of two other systems of 
records that the Agency has stopped maintaining: Investigative Services 
Case Files (NLRB-16, Federal Register, May 16, 1988), and Telephone 
Call Detail Records (NLRB-19, Federal Register, August 17, 1994). All 
persons are advised that, in the absence of submitted comments 
considered by the Agency as warranting modification of the notice as 
proposed, it is the intention of the Agency that the notice shall be 
effective upon expiration of the comment period without further action.

DATES: Written comments on the system's routine uses must be submitted 
on or before May 9, 2024. The routine uses in this action will become 
effective on May 9, 2024 unless written comments are received that 
require a contrary determination.

ADDRESSES: All persons who desire to submit written comments for 
consideration by the Agency in connection with the proposed notice of 
system of records notice shall file them with the Senior Agency 
Official for Privacy (SAOP), National Labor Relations Board, 1015 Half 
Street SE, Washington, DC 20570. Comments on this notice may also be 
submitted electronically to <a href="/cdn-cgi/l/email-protection#a4d4d6cdd2c5c7dde4cac8d6c68ac3cbd2"><span class="__cf_email__" data-cfemail="fe8e8c97889f9d87be90928c9cd0999188">[email&#160;protected]</span></a> or through <a href="http://www.regulations.gov">http://www.regulations.gov</a>, which contains a copy of this proposed notice and 
any submitted comments.

SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION: NxGen contains information from the twelve 
legacy systems, listed below, which are now consolidated into NxGen. 
The system of records notices for these twelve legacy systems are being 
rescinded.
    The Agency previously published a Federal Register notice that it 
was consolidating six of its legacy electronic case tracking systems 
into a new electronic system, NxGen. 77 FR 5062 (Feb. 1, 2012). The 
system of records notices for those six systems had been published at 
71 FR 74,941 (Dec. 13, 2006). Those six systems were:
    1. Judicial Case Management System--Pending Case List (JCMS-PCL) 
and Associated Headquarters Files (NLRB-21);
    2. Judicial Case Management System-eRoom (JCMS-eRoom) (NLRB-22);
    3. Solicitors System (SOL) and Associated Headquarters Files (NLRB-
23);
    4. Case Activity Tracking System (CATS) and Associated Regional 
Office Files (NLRB-25);
    5. Regional Advice and Injunction Litigation System (RAILS) and 
Associated Headquarters Files (NLRB-28); and
    6. Appeals Case Tracking System (ACTS) and Associated Headquarters 
Files (NLRB-30).
    In addition to the six legacy systems cited in the 2012 notice, 
NxGen now includes records from the following five additional legacy 
systems, whose system of records notices were also published at 71 FR 
74,941 (Dec. 13, 2006):
    7. Trial Information Gathered on Electronic Record (TIGER) and 
Associated Agency Files (NLRB-24);
    8. Litigation Information on the Network (LION) (NLRB-26);
    9. Special Litigation Branch Case Tracking System (SPLIT) and 
Associated Headquarters Files (NLRB-27);
    10. Work in Progress (WIP) and Associated Headquarters Files (NLRB-
29); and
    11. Office of Appeals Extension of Time System (NLRB-31).
    NxGen also contains records from a legacy system called:
    12. Agency Disciplinary Case Files (Nonemployees) (NLRB-20), whose 
system of records notices were published at 58 FR 57633 (Oct. 26, 1993) 
and 61 FR 13884 (March 28, 1996), concerning disciplinary proceedings 
of non-Board attorneys pursuant to 29 CFR 102.177 (``102.177 cases'').
    In addition to rescinding the twelve legacy systems listed above, 
the Agency is also rescinding two other systems of records that the 
Agency has stopped maintaining:
    <bullet> Investigative Services Case Files (NLRB-16), 53 FR 17262 
(May 16,

[[Page 24870]]

1988), concerning Agency investigations related to unfair labor 
practice cases (including compliance processing, as explained below) 
where, for charges that appear meritorious, there is concern about 
whether the correct party has been alleged or whether the charged 
party's financial condition raises questions about its ability to 
remedy unfair labor practices. For those records formerly contained in 
NLRB-16 that are not contained in NxGen, the Agency has treated those 
records pursuant the NLRB's Comprehensive Records Schedule (with 
National Archives and Records Administration (NARA) filename NC1-025-
81-01) for ``transitory files'' (Standard Number 101-04), with a 
disposition of destruction after 90 days; and
    <bullet> Telephone Call Detail Records (NLRB-19), 59 FR 42315 
(August 17, 1994), concerning records relating to use of Agency 
telephones to place long-distance calls. The Agency has treated records 
from NLRB-19 pursuant to the disposition instructions in NARA General 
Records Schedule 5.6 for ``Records of credit card abuse and postal 
irregularities'' (Item 050).
    NxGen contains case information regarding matters before the Board 
(including matters before the Office of the Solicitor, the Office of 
Representation Appeals, and the Office of the Executive Secretary), the 
Division of Judges, the Division of Operations-Management, Regional 
Offices, the Appellate and Supreme Court Litigation Branch, the 
Division of Advice's Regional Advice and Injunction Litigation 
Branches, the Office of Appeals, and the Contempt, Compliance, and 
Special Litigation Branch.
    Records in NxGen include administrative unfair labor practice and 
representation proceeding documents, litigation files, transcripts, 
exhibits, briefs, motions, Board decisions, court opinions and orders 
made in the adjudication of cases, 102.177 case records, 
correspondence, legal research memoranda, and other related documents.
    Pursuant to 5 U.S.C. 552a(k)(2), the Agency has exempted portions 
of NxGen from the following provisions of the Privacy Act: 5 U.S.C. 
552a(c)(3), (d), (e)(1), (e)(4)(G), (e)(4)(H), (e)(4)(I) and (f). See 
29 CFR. 102.119, published at 82 FR 11754, Feb. 24, 2017, as amended at 
84 FR 70425, Dec. 23, 2020, and 85 FR 75855, Nov. 27, 2020. Pursuant 
this Notice of a modified system of records and rescindment of system 
of records notices, the Agency, in a Direct Final Rule that appears 
elsewhere in this issue of the Federal Register, is setting forth 
consolidated exemptions for the NxGen system to make technical changes 
that would eliminate references to the legacy systems listed above. A 
report of the proposal to significantly revise this system of records 
has been filed pursuant to 5 U.S.C. 552a(r) with Congress and the 
Office of Management and Budget.
    References to the Agency's ``unfair labor practice cases'' in this 
notice include the portion of such cases known as ``compliance,'' 
during which the Agency seeks effectuation of remedial provisions of a 
settlement agreement, Board order, or court judgment enforcing a Board 
order. See NLRB Casehandling Manual, Part 3, Compliance Proceedings 
(October 2020).

    Chief Information Officer, National Labor Relations Board.

AUTHORITY FOR MAINTENANCE OF THE SYSTEM:
    29 U.S.C. 153(d), 159, 160, 161; 44 U.S.C. 3101; the Government 
Performance and Results Act of 1993, Public Law 103-62, 107 Stat. 285 
(codified in sections of Titles 5, 31, and 39 of the U.S. Code); the

as amended by E.O. 13478 (73 FR 70239, Nov. 20, 2008), relating to 
federal use of Social Security numbers.

PURPOSE(S) OF THE SYSTEM:
    NxGen is an electronic case management system used by offices of 
the Agency to facilitate the accurate and timely collection, retrieval, 
and retention of information regarding the processing of unfair labor 
practice and representation cases, as well as other matters. The 
following offices of the Agency use NxGen for the purposes described:
    <bullet> the Offices of the Board (Members and their staffs, the 
Office of Representation Appeals, the Office of the Solicitor, and the 
Office of the Executive Secretary) to facilitate collaborative drafting 
of decisions and disposition of cases and other matters before the 
Board;
    <bullet> the Division of Judges for managing cases before the 
Division;
    <bullet> the Division of Operations-Management and the Regional 
Offices for the processing of unfair labor practice charges, 
representation petitions, and matters arising under 29 CFR 102.177;
    <bullet> the Appellate and Supreme Court Litigation Branch for 
cases referred to the Branch for enforcement or review in the federal 
courts of appeals, pursuant to Section 10(e) and (f) of the National 
Labor Relations Act (NLRA), 29 U.S.C. 160(e) and (f), as well as for

(CCSLB) to facilitate case handling by the Branch; and
    <bullet> the Office of Appeals for reviewing appeals of decisions 
by Regional Directors to dismiss or defer unfair labor practice charges 
and requests for extensions of time to file appeals.
    The information and activities tracked by the system may be 
generated by parties' filings of briefs, motions, and other documents, 
or by deliberative, analytical processes undertaken by Agency employees 
assigned to cases. This system stores current and historical 
information and is used to: facilitate and document casehandling; 
generate data for managing the Agency's case processing and resources; 
create the Agency's budget; prepare monthly and annual reports of 
casehandling activities; provide responses to requests pursuant to the 
Freedom of Information Act (FOIA), 5 U.S.C. 552; and provide 
information to the public, Congress, and other governmental entities. 
The information in this system may be used to assist in evaluating 
performance of Agency employees.

CATEGORIES OF INDIVIDUALS COVERED BY THE SYSTEM:
    Individual charged parties and individual charging parties in 
unfair labor practice cases; individual petitioners and individual 
employers in representation cases; individual representatives and named 
contacts of parties in unfair labor practice and representation cases, 
as well as related judicial or administrative proceedings; individual 
discriminatees in unfair

[[Page 24871]]

petitions for rulemaking with the Board; non-Agency attorneys who are 
the subjects of disciplinary proceedings under Section 102.177 of the 
Board's Rules and Regulations; current Agency employees assigned to 
cases or other matters or judicial proceedings involving the Agency.

CATEGORIES OF RECORDS IN THE SYSTEM:
    The records contain such data elements as the names of parties, 
case status, Agency personnel assignments, due dates, hearing dates, 
court judgment dates, case-docketing information, parties' home 
addresses and home telephone numbers, personal email addresses, 
signatures, and health and/or medical information. For certain 
discriminatees in unfair labor practice cases, the records may also 
include the discriminatee's name, date of birth, date of death (if 
applicable), Social Security number, amounts of certain earnings, bank 
account information (where the discriminatee elects to receive funds 
through direct deposit), as well as the name, address, identification 
number of discriminatee's employer.

RECORD SOURCE CATEGORIES:
    Record source categories include parties, representatives, 
witnesses, Agency employees, and the Social Security Administration in 
the following types of matters: unfair labor practice and 
representation cases; petitions for rulemaking; Section 102.177 cases; 
and other matters handled by Agency offices.

integrity of the NLRB, or when disclosure is necessary to demonstrate 
the accountability of the Agency, except to the extent the Senior 
Agency Official for Privacy determines that release of the specific

Relations Board has determined that as a result of the suspected or 
confirmed breach there is a risk of harm to individuals, the National 
Labor Relations Board (including its information systems, programs, and 
operations), the federal government, or national security; and (3) the

necessary to fulfill its responsibilities in 5 U.S.C. 552(h), to review 
administrative agency policies, procedures and compliance with the 
FOIA, and to facilitate OGIS's offering of mediation services to 
resolve disputes between persons making FOIA requests and 
administrative agencies.

POLICIES AND PRACTICES FOR STORAGE OF RECORDS:
    Currently, the data is maintained as electronic records in NxGen. 
Limited historical information is on electronic media.

POLICIES AND PRACTICES FOR RETRIEVAL OF RECORDS:
    Data may be retrieved by Agency employees through the application's 
query search by case number, case type, dispute state, case status, 
region, date filed, date created, issued date, document source, 
document type, and NxGen action, as well as by using the iSearch 
function, which is a free-form search of all text, including individual 
names.
    Visibility protocols are in place to ensure that General Counsel-
side employees and Board-side employees may only view their own side's 
internal documents.

POLICIES AND PRACTICES FOR RETENTION AND DISPOSAL OF RECORDS:
    NxGen records will be retained and disposed of in accordance with 
the NLRB's Request for Records Disposition Authority, Records Schedule 
Number DAA-0025-2017-0001, approved by NARA on April 9, 2018. Any 
subsequent versions of the NxGen records schedule will be posted on 
NARA's website (<a href="https://www.archives.gov">https://www.archives.gov</a>).

ADMINISTRATIVE, TECHNICAL, AND PHYSICAL SAFEGUARDS:
    Electronic system-based access controls are in place to prevent 
data misuse. Access to electronic information is controlled by 
administrators who determine users' authorized access based on each 
user's office and position within the office.
    Access criteria, procedures, controls, and responsibilities are 
documented and consistent with the policies stated in applicable 
guidance from the NLRB Office of the Chief Information Officer. All 
network users are also warned at the time of each network login that 
the system is for use by authorized users only and that unauthorized or 
improper use is a violation of law.

RECORD ACCESS PROCEDURES:
    For records not exempted under 5 U.S.C. 552a(k)(2), an individual 
seeking to gain access to records in this system pertaining to such 
individual should contact the System Manager in accordance with the

in this system have been exempted from Privacy Act provisions at 5 
U.S.C. 552a(c)(3) and (d), regarding access to records. The section of 
this notice titled ``Exemptions Promulgated for the System'' indicates 
the kind of material exempted and the reasons for exempting them from 
access.
    An individual requesting access in person must provide identity 
documents sufficient to satisfy the custodian of the records that the 
requester is entitled to such access, such as a government-issued photo 
ID. Individuals requesting access via mail must furnish, at minimum, 
name, date of birth, and home address in order to establish identity. 
Requesters should also reasonably specify the record contents being 
sought.

CONTESTING RECORD PROCEDURES:
    For records not exempted under 5 U.S.C. 552a(k)(2), an individual 
may request amendment of a record in this system pertaining to such 
individual by directing a request to the System Manager in accordance 
with the procedures set forth in 29 CFR 102.119(d). Specific materials 
in this system have been exempted from Privacy Act provisions at 5 
U.S.C. 552a(d), regarding amendment of records. The section of this 
notice titled ``Exemptions Promulgated for the System'' indicates the 
kinds of material exempted and the reasons for exempting them from 
amendment.
    An individual seeking to contest records in person must provide 
identity documents sufficient to satisfy the custodian of the records 
that the requester is entitled to contest such records, such as a 
government-issued photo ID. Individuals seeking to contest records via 
mail must furnish, at minimum, name, date of birth, and home address in 
order to establish identity. Requesters should also reasonably identify 
the record, specify the information they are contesting, state the 
corrective action sought and the reasons for the correction along with 
supporting justification showing why the record is not accurate, 
timely, relevant, or complete.

NOTIFICATION PROCEDURES:
    An individual may inquire as to whether this system contains a 
record pertaining to such individual by sending a request in writing, 
signed, to the System Manager at the address above, in accordance with 
the procedures set forth in 29 CFR 102.119(a).
    An individual requesting notification of records in person must 
provide identity documents sufficient to satisfy the custodian of the 
records that the requester is entitled to such notification, such as a 
government-issued photo ID. Individuals requesting notification via 
mail must furnish, at minimum, name, date of birth, and home address in 
order to establish identity.

EXEMPTIONS PROMULGATED FOR THE SYSTEM:
    Pursuant to 5 U.S.C. 552a(k)(2), the Agency has exempted portions 
of this system, including, with respect to General Counsel-side 
information, investigatory records pertaining to unfair labor practice 
and representation cases, and with respect to Board-side information, 
investigatory records relating to requests to pursue proceedings under 
Section 10(j) of the NLRA (29 U.S.C. 160(j)), requests to pursue 
federal court contempt proceedings, and certain requests that the Board 
initiate litigation or intervene in non-Agency litigation, from the 
following provisions of the Privacy Act: 5 U.S.C. 552a(c)(3), (d), 
(e)(1), (e)(4)(G), (e)(4)(H), (e)(4)(I) and(f). This system may contain 
the following types of information:

    Investigatory material compiled for law enforcement purposes, 
other than material within the scope of 5 U.S.C. 552a(j)(2):

[[Page 24873]]

Provided, however, that if any individual is denied any right, 
privilege, or benefit to which he would otherwise be entitled by 
Federal law, or for which he would otherwise be eligible, as a 
result of the maintenance of such material, such material shall be 
provided to such individual, except to the extent that the 
disclosure of such material would reveal the identity of a source 
who furnished information to the Government under an express promise 
that the identity of the source would be held in confidence, or, 
prior to September 27, 1975, under an implied promise that the 
identity of the source would be held in confidence.
