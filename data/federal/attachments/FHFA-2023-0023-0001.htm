SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION:

I. Comments

    FHFA seeks public comments on the revisions to the system of 
records and will take all comments into consideration. See 5 U.S.C. 
552a(e)(4) and (11). In addition to referencing ``Comments/No. 2023-N-
14,'' please reference ``FHFA-15, Payroll, Retirement, Time and 
Attendance, and Leave Records.''
    FHFA will make all comments timely received available for 
examination by the public through the electronic comment docket for 
this notice, which is located on the FHFA website at <a href="https://www.fhfa.gov">https://www.fhfa.gov</a>. All comments received will be posted without change and

address (mailing and email), telephone numbers, and any other

II. Introduction

    This notice informs the public of FHFA's proposed revisions to an 
existing system of records. This notice satisfies the Privacy Act 
requirement that an agency publishes a system of records notice in the 
Federal Register when there is an addition or change to an agency's 
system of records. Congress has recognized that application of all 
requirements of the Privacy Act to certain categories of records may 
have an undesirable and often unacceptable effect upon agencies in the 
conduct of necessary public business. Consequently, Congress 
established general exemptions and specific exemptions that could be 
used to exempt records from provisions of the Privacy Act. Congress 
also required that exempting records from provisions of the Privacy Act 
would require the head of an agency to publish a determination to 
exempt a record from the Privacy Act as a rule in accordance with the 
Administrative Procedure Act. Records and information in this system of 
records are not exempt from the requirements of the Privacy Act.
    As required by the Privacy Act, 5 U.S.C. 552a(r), and pursuant to 
section 7 of Office of Management and Budget (OMB) Circular No. A-108, 
``Federal Agency Responsibilities for Review, Reporting, and 
Publication under the Privacy Act,'' prior to publication of this 
notice, FHFA submitted a report describing the system of records 
covered by this notice to the OMB, the Committee on Oversight and 
Government Reform of the House of Representatives, and the Committee on 
Homeland Security and Governmental Affairs of the Senate.

III. Revised System of Records

    The revised system of records notice is set out in its entirety and 
described in detail below. The proposed modification to the System 
makes the following substantive and non-substantive changes:
    (1) Adds new categories of records collected in the system to allow 
FHFA to collect and maintain information related to employee work 
agreements.
    (2) Updates the service provider used to maintain the payroll, 
retirement, and leave records system from the National Finance Center 
to the Interior Business Center.
    (3) Adds a new authority, Telework Enhancement Act of 2010 (5 
U.S.C. 6501-6506), to allow for the collection and maintenance of the 
new proposed category, and corrects other authorities listed.
    (4) Expands the system's purpose for collecting the information to 
include the collection of employee work agreements.
    (5) Expands the system's record source categories to include 
employee work agreements.
    (6) Revises the existing routine uses to be consistent with FHFA's 
standard routine uses and those specific to this collection. Routine 
use 1 has been revised but remains in the same numerical position; a 
new routine use 2 has been added and the former routine use 2 has been 
revised and is now routine use 3; former routine use 3 has been revised 
and is now routine use 4; former routine uses 4-6 have been deleted; 
new routine uses 6, 8-9 have been added; routine use 7 has been revised 
but remains in the same numerical position; former routine use 8 has 
been deleted; former routine use 9

[[Page 80302]]

has been revised and is now routine use 5; former routine uses 10-14 
have been deleted; and former routine uses 15-24 remain unchanged in 
text but are now numerically routine uses 10-19.
    (7) Makes minor corrections and other administrative updates to the 
remaining sections of the notice in accordance with OMB Circular A-108.

enforcing or implementing a statute, rule, regulation, or order issued 
pursuant thereto.

investigation conducted by FHFA, or in connection with civil
