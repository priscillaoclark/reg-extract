Background

    The Kingpin Act became law on December 3, 1999. The Kingpin Act 
establishes a program targeting the activities of significant foreign 
narcotics traffickers and their organizations on a worldwide basis. It 
provides a statutory framework for the President to impose sanctions 
against significant foreign narcotics traffickers and their 
organizations on a worldwide basis, with the objective of denying their 
businesses and agents access to the U.S. financial system and the 
benefits of trade and transactions involving U.S. companies and 
individuals.
    The Kingpin Act blocks all property and interests in property, 
subject to U.S. jurisdiction, owned or controlled by significant 
foreign narcotics traffickers as identified by the President. In 
addition, the Secretary of the Treasury consults with the Attorney 
General, the Director of the Central Intelligence Agency, the Director 
of the Federal Bureau of Investigation, the Administrator of the Drug 
Enforcement Administration, the Secretary of Defense, the Secretary of 
State, and the

property and interests in property, subject to U.S. jurisdiction, of 
persons who are found to be: (1) Materially assisting in, or providing 
financial or technological support for or to, or providing goods or 
services in support of, the international narcotics trafficking 
activities of a person designated pursuant to the Kingpin Act; (2) 
owned, controlled, or directed by, or acting for or on behalf of, a 
person designated pursuant to the Kingpin Act; or (3) playing a 
significant role in international narcotics trafficking.
    On July 22, 2010, the Director of OFAC designated two entities
