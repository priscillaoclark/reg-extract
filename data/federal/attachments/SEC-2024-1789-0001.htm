E

December 4, 2024.
    Pursuant to Section 19(b)(1) \1\ of the Securities Exchange Act of 
1934 (the ``Act''),\2\ and Rule 19b-4 thereunder,\3\ notice is hereby 
given that on December 2, 2024, NYSE Arca, Inc. (``NYSE Arca'' or the 
``Exchange'') filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission (the

below, which Items have been prepared by the self-regulatory 
organization. The Commission is publishing this notice to solicit 
comments on the proposed rule change from interested persons.

    \2\ 15 U.S.C. 78a.
    \3\ 17 CFR 240.19b-4.
---------------------------------------------------------------------------

I. Self-Regulatory Organization's Statement of the Terms of Substance 
of the Proposed Rule Change

    The Exchange proposes to amend Rule 7.37-E to specify the 
Exchange's source of data feeds from Investors' Exchange, LLC (``IEX'') 
for purposes of order handling, order execution, order routing, and 
regulatory compliance. The proposed rule change is available on the 
Exchange's website at <a href="http://www.nyse.com">www.nyse.com</a>, at the principal office of the 
Exchange, and at the Commission's Public Reference Room.

II. Self-Regulatory Organization's Statement of the Purpose of, and 
Statutory Basis for, the Proposed Rule Change

    In its filing with the Commission, the self-regulatory organization 
included statements concerning the purpose of, and basis for, the 
proposed rule change and discussed any comments it received on the 
proposed rule change. The text of those statements may be examined at 
the places specified in Item IV below. The Exchange has prepared 
summaries, set forth in sections A, B, and C below, of the most 
significant parts of such statements.

A. Self-Regulatory Organization's Statement of the Purpose of, and the 
Statutory Basis for, the Proposed Rule Change

1. Purpose
    The Exchange proposes to update and amend the use of data feeds 
table in Rule 7.37-E(d), which sets forth on a market-by-market basis 
the specific securities information processor (``SIP'') and proprietary 
data feeds that the Exchange utilizes for the handling, execution, and 
routing of orders, and for performing the regulatory compliance checks 
related to each of those functions. Specifically, the Exchange proposes 
to amend the table in Rule 7.37-E(d) to specify that, with respect to 
IEX, the Exchange will receive an IEX direct feed as its primary source 
of data for order handling, order execution, order routing, and 
regulatory compliance, and will use the SIP Data Feed as its secondary 
source for data from IEX.\4\
---------------------------------------------------------------------------

    \4\ The Exchange previously filed a similar proposal, but 
inadvertently failed to seek waiver of the 30-day operative delay 
necessary to make the proposal operative by December 7, 2024, the 
date when the technology underlying the proposal will be launched on 
the Exchange's systems. See Securities Exchange Act Release No. 
101681 (November 21, 2024) (SR-NYSEARCA-2024-95). The Exchange 
subsequently attempted to cure that failure by making a supplemental 
filing to accelerate the operative date of SR-NYSEARCA-2024-95. See 
SR-NYSEARCA-2024-103. The Exchange has now withdrawn both SR-
NYSEARCA-2024-95 and SR-NYSEARCA-2024-103 and has replaced them with 
the instant filing.
---------------------------------------------------------------------------

    The Exchange proposes to make this change immediately operative 
upon filing so that the Exchange may deploy the change on or about 
December 7, 2024, the date when the technology underlying the proposal 
will be launched on the Exchange's systems.
2. Statutory Basis
    The Exchange believes that the proposed rule change is consistent 
with Section 6(b) of the Act, in general, and furthers the objectives 
of Section 6(b)(5), in particular, because it is designed to prevent 
fraudulent and manipulative acts and practices, to promote just and 
equitable principles of trade, to foster cooperation and coordination 
with persons engaged in facilitating transactions in securities, to 
remove impediments to, and perfect the mechanism of, a free and open 
market and a national market system and, in general, to protect 
investors and the public interest. Additionally, the Exchange believes 
that the proposed rule change is consistent with the Section 6(b)(5) 
requirement that the rules of an exchange not be designed to permit 
unfair discrimination between customers, issuers, brokers, or dealers.
    The Exchange believes its proposal to update the table in Rule 
7.37-E(d) to include the IEX direct feed will ensure that the Rule 
correctly identifies and publicly states on a market-by-market basis 
all of the specific SIP and proprietary data feeds that the Exchange 
utilizes for the handling, execution, and routing of orders, and for 
performing the regulatory compliance checks for each of those 
functions. The proposed rule change also removes impediments to and 
perfects the mechanism of a free and open market and protects investors 
and the public interest by providing additional specificity, clarity, 
and transparency in the Exchange's rules.

B. Self-Regulatory Organization's Statement on Burden on Competition

    The Exchange does not believe that the proposed rule change will 
impose any burden on competition that is not necessary or appropriate 
in furtherance of the purposes of the Act. Rather, the Exchange 
believes that the proposal will enhance competition because providing 
the public and market participants with up-to-date information about 
the data feeds the Exchange will use for the handling, execution, and 
routing of orders, as well as for regulatory compliance would enhance 
transparency and enable investors to better assess the quality of the 
Exchange's execution and routing services. The Exchange also believes 
the proposal would enhance competition because it would potentially 
enhance the performance of its order handling and execution of orders 
in equity securities by receiving market data directly from IEX. 
Finally, the proposed rule change would not impact competition between 
market participants because it will affect all market participants 
equally.

C. Self-Regulatory Organization's Statement on Comments on the Proposed 
Rule Change Received From Members, Participants, or Others

    No written comments were solicited or received with respect to the 
proposed rule change.

III. Date of Effectiveness of the Proposed Rule Change and Timing for 
Commission Action

    The Exchange has filed the proposed rule change pursuant to Section 
19(b)(3)(A)(iii) of the Act \5\ and Rule 19b-4(f)(6) thereunder.\6\ 
Because the proposed rule change does not: (i) significantly affect the 
protection of investors or the public interest; (ii) impose any 
significant burden on competition; and (iii) become operative prior to 
30 days from the date on which it was filed, or such shorter time as 
the Commission may designate, if consistent with the protection of 
investors and the public interest, the

[[Page 99319]]

proposed rule change has become effective pursuant to Section 
19(b)(3)(A) of the Act \7\ and Rule 19b-4(f)(6)(iii) thereunder.\8\
---------------------------------------------------------------------------

    \5\ 15 U.S.C. 78s(b)(3)(A)(iii).
    \6\ 17 CFR 240.19b-4(f)(6).
    \7\ 15 U.S.C. 78s(b)(3)(A).
    \8\ 17 CFR 240.19b-4(f)(6). In addition, Rule 19b-4(f)(6) 
requires a self-regulatory organization to give the Commission 
written notice of its intent to file the proposed rule change, along 
with a brief description and text of the proposed rule change, at 
least five business days prior to the date of filing of the proposed 
rule change, or such shorter time as designated by the Commission. 
The Exchange has satisfied this requirement.
---------------------------------------------------------------------------

    A proposed rule change filed under Rule 19b-4(f)(6) \9\ normally 
does not become operative prior to 30 days after the date of the 
filing. However, pursuant to Rule 19b-4(f)(6)(iii),\10\ the Commission 
may designate a shorter time if such action is consistent with the 
protection of investors and the public interest. The Exchange has asked 
the Commission to waive the 30-day operative delay so that the proposed 
rule change may become operative immediately upon filing. The Exchange 
states that it operates in a highly competitive environment and is 
launching a technology change that includes the improvement described 
in its proposed rule change on December 7, 2024. Since that December 7, 
2024 date is imminent, the Exchange requests waiver of the 30-day 
operative delay with respect to this proposed rule change.
---------------------------------------------------------------------------

    \9\ 17 CFR 240.19b-4(f0(6).
    \10\ 17 CFR 240.19b-4(f)(6)(iii).
---------------------------------------------------------------------------

    The Commission believes that waiver of the operative delay is 
consistent with the protection of investors and the public interest. 
The Exchange states that the proposed rule change would enhance 
competition because it would potentially enhance the performance of its 
order handling and execution of orders in equity securities by 
receiving market data directly from IEX. In addition, a waiver of the 
operative delay will allow the Exchange to promptly implement the 
proposed rule change with other technology changes that are scheduled 
to be implemented on December 7, 2024. Accordingly, the Commission 
hereby waives the 30-day operative delay and designates the proposed 
rule change operative upon filing.\11\
---------------------------------------------------------------------------

    \11\ For purposes only of waiver the 30-day operative delay, the 
Commission has also considered the proposed rule's impact on 
efficiency, competition, and capital formation. See 15 U.S.C. 
78c(f).
---------------------------------------------------------------------------

    At any time within 60 days of the filing of such proposed rule 
change, the Commission summarily may temporarily suspend such rule 
change if it appears to the Commission that such action is necessary or 
appropriate in the public interest, for the protection of investors, or 
otherwise in furtherance of the purposes of the Act. If the Commission 
takes such action, the Commission shall institute proceedings under 
Section 19(b)(2)(B) \12\ of the Act to determine whether the proposed 
rule change should be approved or disapproved.
---------------------------------------------------------------------------

    \12\ 15 U.S.C. 78s(b)(2)(B).
