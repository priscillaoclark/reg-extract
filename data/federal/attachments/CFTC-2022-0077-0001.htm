SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION:
    Title: Clearing Exemption for Certain Swaps Entered into by 
Cooperatives (OMB Control No. 3038-0102). This is a request for an 
extension of a currently approved information collection.
    Abstract: Section 2(h)(1)(A) of the Commodity Exchange Act 
(``CEA'') requires certain entities to submit swaps for clearing if 
they are required to be cleared by the Commission. Commission 
regulation 50.51 permits certain cooperatives to elect not to clear 
certain swaps that otherwise would be required to be cleared, provided 
that they meet certain conditions. The rule establishes a reporting 
requirement for cooperatives that is critical to ensuring compliance 
with the Commission's clearing requirement under section 2(h)(1) of the 
CEA and is necessary in order for Commission staff to prevent abuse of 
the cooperative exemption. In addition, this collection relates to 
information that the Commission needs to monitor elections of the 
cooperative exemption and to assess market risks.
    An agency may not conduct or sponsor, and a person is not required 
to respond to, a collection of information unless it displays a 
currently valid OMB

collection and provided 60 days for public comment on the proposed
