SECURITIES AND EXCHANGE COMMISSION

[SEC File No. 270-098, OMB Control No. 3235-0081]


Submission for OMB Review; Comment Request; Extension: Rule 12d2-
1

Upon Written Request, Copies Available From: Securities and Exchange 
Commission, Office of FOIA Services, 100 F Street NE, Washington, DC 
20549-2736.

    Notice is hereby given that pursuant to the Paperwork Reduction Act 
of 1995 (``PRA'') (44 U.S.C. 3501 et seq.), the Securities and Exchange 
Commission

[[Page 88843]]

(``Commission'') has submitted to the Office of Management and Budget 
(``OMB'') a request for approval of extension of the previously 
approved collection of information provided for in Rule 12d2-1 (17 CFR 
240.12d2-1), under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 (15 U.S.C. 78a 
et seq.) (``Act'').
    On February 12, 1935, the Commission adopted Rule 12d2-1 \1\ 
(``Suspension of Trading'') which sets forth the conditions and 
procedures under which a security may be suspended from trading under 
Section 12(d) of the Act.\2\ Rule 12d2-1 provides the procedures by 
which a national securities exchange may suspend from trading a 
security that is listed and registered on the exchange. Under Rule 
12d2-1, an exchange is permitted to suspend from trading a listed 
security in accordance with its rules and must promptly notify the 
Commission of any such suspension, along with the effective date and 
the reasons for the suspension.
---------------------------------------------------------------------------

    \1\ See Securities Exchange Act Release No. 98 (February 12, 
1935).
    \2\ See Securities Exchange Act Release No. 7011 (February 5, 
1963), 28 FR 1506 (February 16, 1963).
---------------------------------------------------------------------------

    Any such suspension may be continued until such time as the 
Commission may determine that the suspension is designed to evade the 
provisions of Section 12(d) of the Act and Rule 12d2-2 thereunder.\3\ 
During the continuance of such suspension under Rule 12d2-1, the 
exchange is required to notify the Commission promptly of any change in 
the reasons for the suspension. Upon the restoration to trading of any 
security suspended under Rule 12d2-1, the exchange must notify the 
Commission promptly of the effective date of such restoration.
---------------------------------------------------------------------------

    \3\ Rule 12d2-2 prescribes the circumstances under which a 
security may be delisted from an exchange and withdrawn from 
registration under Section 12(b) of the Act and provides the 
procedures for taking such action.
---------------------------------------------------------------------------

    The trading suspension notices serve a number of purposes. First, 
they inform the Commission that an exchange has suspended from trading 
a listed security or reintroduced trading in a previously suspended 
security. They also provide the Commission with information necessary 
for it to determine that the suspension has been accomplished in 
accordance with the rules of the exchange, and to verify that the 
exchange has not evaded the requirements of Section 12(d) of the Act 
and Rule 12d2-2 thereunder by improperly employing a trading 
suspension. Without Rule 12d2-1, the Commission would be unable to 
fully implement these statutory responsibilities.
    There are 24 national securities exchanges \4\ that are subject to 
Rule 12d2-1. The burden of complying with Rule 12d2-1 is not evenly 
distributed among the exchanges, however, since there are many more 
securities listed on the New York Stock Exchange, Inc., the NASDAQ 
Stock Exchange, and the NYSE American LLC than on the other 
exchanges.\5\ There are approximately 658 responses \6\ under Rule 
12d2-1 for the purpose of suspension of trading from the national 
securities exchanges each year, and the resultant aggregate annual 
reporting hour burden would be, assuming on average one-half reporting 
hour per response, 329 annual burden hours for all exchanges. The 
related internal compliance costs associated with these burden hours 
are $79,618 per year.
---------------------------------------------------------------------------

    \4\ The Exchanges are BOX Exchange LLC, Cboe BYX Exchange, Inc., 
Cboe BZX Exchange, Inc., Cboe C2 Exchange, Inc., Cboe EDGA Exchange, 
Inc., Cboe EDGX Exchange, Inc., Cboe Exchange, Inc., Investors 
Exchange LLC, Long Term Stock Exchange, Inc., MEMX, LLC, Miami 
International Securities Exchange, MIAX Emerald, LLC, MIAX PEARL, 
LLC, Nasdaq BX, Inc., Nasdaq GEMX, LLC, Nasdaq ISE, LLC, Nasdaq MRX, 
LLC, Nasdaq PHLX LLC, The Nasdaq Stock Market, New York Stock 
Exchange LLC, NYSE Arca, Inc., NYSE Chicago, Inc., NYSE American 
LLC, NYSE National, Inc.
    \5\ In fact, some exchanges do not file any trading suspension 
reports in a given year.
    \6\ The 658 figure was calculated by averaging the numbers for 
compliance in 2021, 2022 and 2023, which are 538, 622 and 814, 
respectively.
---------------------------------------------------------------------------

mandatory. The response will be available to the public and will not be 
kept confidential.
