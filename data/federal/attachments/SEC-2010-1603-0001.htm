    Form 5 OMB Control No. 3235-0362 SEC File No. 270-323.

    Notice is hereby given that, pursuant to the Paperwork Reduction 
Act of 1995 (44 U.S.C. 3501 et seq.), the Securities and Exchange 
Commission (``Commission'') has submitted to the Office of Management 
and Budget this request for extension of the previously approved 
collection of information discussed below.

owner of more than 10 percent of any class of any equity security 
(other than an exempted security) which registered pursuant to Section 
12 of the Exchange Act, or who is a director or an officer of the 
issuer of such security (collectively ``reporting persons''), must file 
statements setting forth their security holdings in the issuer with the 
Commission. Form 5 (17 CFR 249.105) is an annual statement of 
beneficial ownership of securities. The information disclosure provided 
on Form 5 is mandatory. All information is provided to the public for 
review. Approximately 9,000 reporting persons file Form 5 annually and 
we estimate that it takes approximately one hour to prepare the form 
for a total of 9,000 annual burden hours.
    An agency may not conduct or sponsor, and a person is not required 
to respond to, a collection of information unless it displays a 
currently valid control number.
    Written comments regarding the above information should be directed 
to the following persons: (i) Desk Officer for the Securities and 
Exchange Commission, Office of Information and Regulatory Affairs, 
Office of Management and Budget, Room 10102, New Executive Office 
Building, Washington, DC 20503 or send an e-mail to: <A HREF="mailto:Shagufta_Ahmed@omb.eop.gov">Shagufta_
