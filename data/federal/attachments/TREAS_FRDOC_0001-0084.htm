FOR FURTHER INFORMATION CONTACT: Bryan Saddler, Chief Counsel, Office 
of the Special Inspector General for the Troubled Asset Relief Program, 
1500 Pennsylvania Avenue, NW., Room 1010, Washington, DC 20220, (202) 
927-8938.

SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION: The Emergency Economic Stabilization Act of 
2008 (Act), Public Law 110-343, established the Troubled Asset Relief 
Program, and, at section 121 (12 U.S.C. 5231), created SIGTARP. SIGTARP 
is responsible for coordinating and conducting audits and 
investigations of any program established by the Secretary under 
sections 101 and 102 of the Act. SIGTARP's duties and operating 
authority are set forth under section 121 of the Act, as amended, and 
the Inspector General Act of 1978, as amended, 5 U.S.C. App. 3. SIGTARP 
conducts, supervises, and coordinates audits and investigations 
relating to the programs and operations of the Troubled Asset Relief 
Program (TARP) and related entities.
    The Department of the Treasury is publishing separately the notices 
of the new systems of records to be maintained by SIGTARP.
    Under 5 U.S.C. 552a(j)(2), the head of a Federal agency may 
promulgate rules to exempt a system of records from certain provisions 
of 5 U.S.C. 552a if the system of records is ``maintained by an agency 
or component thereof which performs as its principal function any 
activity pertaining to the enforcement of criminal laws, including 
police efforts to prevent, control, or reduce crime or to apprehend 
criminals, and the activities of prosecutors, courts, correctional, 
probation, pardon, or parole authorities, and which consists of (A) 
information compiled for the purpose of identifying individual criminal 
offenders and alleged offenders and consisting only of identifying data 
and notations of arrests, the nature and disposition of criminal 
charges, sentencing, confinement, release, and parole and probation 
status; (B) information compiled for the purpose of a criminal 
investigation, including reports of informants and investigators, and 
associated with an identifiable individual; or (C) reports identifiable 
to an individual compiled at any stage of the process of enforcement of 
the criminal laws from arrest or indictment through release from 
supervision.''
    To the extent that these systems of records contain investigative 
material within the provisions of 5 U.S.C. 552a(j)(2), the Department 
of the Treasury proposes to exempt the following systems of records 
from various provisions of the Privacy Act pursuant to 5 U.S.C. 
552a(j)(2):
    DO .220--SIGTARP Hotline Database.
    DO .221--SIGTARP Correspondence Database.
    DO .222--SIGTARP Investigative MIS Database.
    DO .223--SIGTARP Investigative Files Database.
    DO .224--SIGTARP Audit Files Database.
    The proposed exemption under 5 U.S.C. 552a(j)(2) for the above-
referenced systems of records is from provisions 5 U.S.C. 552a (c)(3), 
(c)(4), (d)(1), (d)(2), (d)(3), (d)(4), (e)(1), (e)(2), (e)(3), 
(e)(4)(G), (e)(4)(H), (e)(4)(I), (e)(5), (e)(8), (f), and (g).
    The following are the reasons why the investigative material 
contained in the above-referenced systems of records maintained by 
SIGTARP may be exempted from various provisions of the Privacy Act 
pursuant to 5 U.S.C. 552a(j)(2).
    (1) 5 U.S.C. 552a(e)(4)(G) and (f)(l) enable individuals to inquire 
whether a system of records contains records pertaining to themselves. 
Disclosure of this information to the subjects of investigations would 
provide individuals with information concerning the nature and scope of 
any current investigation. Further, providing information as required 
by this provision would alert the individual to the existence of an 
investigation and afford the individual an opportunity to attempt to 
conceal his/her criminal activities so as to avoid apprehension, may 
enable the individual to avoid detection or apprehension, may enable 
the destruction or alteration of evidence of the criminal conduct that 
would form the basis for an arrest, and could impede or impair 
SIGTARP's ability to investigate the matter. In addition, to provide 
this type of information may enable individuals to learn whether they 
have been identified as subjects of investigation.
    (2) 5 U.S.C. 552a(d)(1), (e)(4)(H), and (f)(2), (3), and (5) grant 
individuals access, or concern procedures by which an individual may 
gain access, to records pertaining to themselves. Disclosure of this 
information to the subjects of investigations would provide them with 
information concerning the nature and scope of any current 
investigation, may enable them to avoid detection or apprehension, may 
enable them to destroy or alter evidence of criminal conduct that would 
form the basis for their arrest, and could impede or impair SIGTARP's 
ability to investigate the matter. In addition, permitting access to 
investigative files and records could disclose the identity of 
confidential sources and the nature of the information supplied by 
informants as well as endanger the physical safety of those sources by 
exposing them to

[[Page 2087]]

possible reprisals for having provided the information. Confidential 
sources and informers might refuse to provide SIGTARP with valuable 
information unless they believe that their identities would not be 
revealed through disclosure of their names or the nature of the 
information they supplied. Loss of access to such sources would 
seriously impair SIGTARP's ability to perform its law enforcement 
responsibilities. Furthermore, providing access to records contained in 
the systems of records could reveal the identities of undercover law 
enforcement officers who compiled information regarding the 
individual's criminal activities, thereby endangering the physical 
safety of those undercover officers by exposing them to possible 
reprisals. Permitting access in keeping with these provisions would 
also discourage other law enforcement and regulatory agencies from 
freely sharing information with SIGTARP and thus would restrict its 
access to information necessary to accomplish its mission most 
effectively.
    (3) 5 U.S.C. 552a(d)(2), (3), and (4), (e)(4)(H), and (f)(4) permit 
an individual to request amendment of a record pertaining to the 
individual or concern related procedures, and require the agency either 
to amend the record or to note the disputed portion of the record, and 
to provide a copy of the individual's statement of disagreement with 
the agency's refusal to amend a record to persons or other agencies to 
whom the record is thereafter disclosed. Since these provisions depend 
upon the individual having access to his or her records, and since an 
exemption from the provisions of 5 U.S.C. 552a relating to access to 
records is proposed, for the reasons set out in the preceding paragraph 
of this section, these provisions should not apply to the above-listed 
systems of records.
    (4) 5 U.S.C. 552a(c)(3) requires an agency to make accountings of 
disclosures of a record available to the individual named in the record 
upon his or her request. Making accountings of disclosures available to 
the subjects of investigations would alert them to the fact that 
SIGTARP is conducting an investigation into their activities as well as 
identify the nature, scope, and purpose of that investigation. 
Providing accountings to the subjects of investigations would alert 
them to the fact that SIGTARP has information regarding their 
activities and could inform them of the general nature of that 
information. The subjects of the investigations, if provided an 
accounting of disclosures, would be able to take measures to avoid 
detection or apprehension by altering their operations or by destroying 
or concealing evidence that would form the basis for detection or 
apprehension.
    (5) 5 U.S.C. 552a(c)(4) requires an agency to inform any person or 
other agency about any correction or notation of dispute that the 
agency made in accordance with 5 U.S.C. 552a(d) to any record that the 
agency disclosed to the person or agency if an accounting of the 
disclosure was made. Since this provision depends on an individual's 
having access to and an opportunity to request amendment of records 
pertaining to the individual, and since an exemption from the 
provisions of 5 U.S.C. 552a relating to access to, and amendment of, 
records is proposed for the reasons set out in paragraph (2) of this 
section, this provision should not apply to these systems of records.
    (6) 5 U.S.C. 552a(e)(4)(I) requires an agency to publish a general 
notice listing the categories of sources for information contained in a 
system of records. Revealing sources of information could disclose 
investigative techniques and procedures, result in threats or reprisals 
against confidential informants by the subjects of investigations, and 
cause confidential informants to refuse to give full information to 
criminal investigators for fear of having their identities as sources 
disclosed.
    (7) 5 U.S.C. 552a(e)(1) requires an agency to maintain in its 
records only such information about an individual as is relevant and 
necessary to accomplish a purpose of the agency required to be 
accomplished by statute or Executive Order. The term ``maintain,'' as 
defined in 5 U.S.C. 552a(a)(3), includes ``collect'' and 
``disseminate.'' The application of this provision could impair 
SIGTARP's ability to collect and disseminate valuable law enforcement 
information. In the early stages of an investigation, it may be 
impossible to determine whether information collected is relevant and 
necessary, and information that initially appears irrelevant and 
unnecessary often may, upon further evaluation or upon review of 
information developed subsequently, prove particularly relevant and 
necessary to a law enforcement program. Compliance with the records 
maintenance criteria listed in the foregoing provision would require 
SIGTARP to periodically update the investigatory material it collects 
and maintains in these systems to ensure that the information remains 
timely and complete. Further, SIGTARP oftentimes will uncover evidence 
of violations of law that fall within the investigative jurisdiction of 
other law enforcement agencies. To promote effective law enforcement, 
SIGTARP will refer this evidence to other law enforcement agencies, 
including State, local, and foreign agencies, that have jurisdiction 
over the offenses to which the information relates. If required to 
adhere to the provisions of 5 U.S.C. 552a(e)(1), SIGTARP might be 
placed in the position of having to ignore information relating to 
violations of law not within its jurisdiction when that information 
comes to SIGTARP's attention during the collection and analysis of 
information in its records.
    (8) 5 U.S.C. 552a(e)(2) requires an agency to collect information 
to the greatest extent practicable directly from the subject individual 
when the information may result in adverse determinations about an 
individual's rights, benefits, and privileges under Federal programs. 
The application of this provision to the above-referenced systems of 
records would impair SIGTARP's ability to collect, analyze, and 
disseminate investigative, intelligence, and enforcement information. 
During criminal investigations it is often a matter of sound 
investigative procedure to obtain information from a variety of sources 
to verify the accuracy of the information obtained. SIGTARP often 
collects information about the subject of a criminal investigation from 
third parties, such as witnesses and informants. It is usually not 
feasible to rely upon the subject of the investigation as a credible 
source for information regarding his or her alleged criminal 
activities. An attempt to obtain information from the subject of a 
criminal investigation will often alert that individual to the 
existence of an investigation, thereby affording the individual an 
opportunity to attempt to conceal his criminal activities so as to 
avoid apprehension.
    (9) 5 U.S.C. 552a(e)(3) requires an agency to inform each 
individual, whom it asks to supply information, of the agency's 
authority for soliciting the information, whether disclosure of 
information is voluntary or mandatory, the principal purpose(s) for 
which the agency will use the information, the routine uses that may be 
made of the information, and the effects on the individual of not 
providing all or part of the information. The above-referenced systems 
of records should be exempted from these provisions to avoid impairing 
SIGTARP's ability to collect and maintain investigative material. 
Confidential sources or undercover law enforcement officers often 
obtain information under circumstances in which it is necessary to keep 
the true

[[Page 2088]]

purpose of their actions secret so as not to let the subject of the 
investigation or his or her associates know that a criminal 
investigation is in progress. Further, application of this provision 
could result in an unwarranted invasion of the personal privacy of the 
subject of the criminal investigation, particularly where further 
investigation reveals that the subject was not involved in any criminal 
activity.
    (10) 5 U.S.C. 552a(e)(5) requires an agency to maintain all records 
it uses in making any determination about any individual with such 
accuracy, relevance, timeliness, and completeness as is reasonably 
necessary to assure fairness to the individual in the determination. 
Since 5 U.S.C. 552a(a)(3) defines ``maintain'' to include ``collect'' 
and ``disseminate,'' application of this provision to the systems of 
records would hinder the initial collection of any information that 
could not, at the moment of collection, be determined to be accurate, 
relevant, timely, and complete. In collecting information during a 
criminal investigation, it is often neither possible nor feasible to 
determine accuracy, relevance, timeliness, or completeness at the time 
that the information is collected. Information that may initially 
appear inaccurate, irrelevant, untimely, or incomplete may, when 
analyzed with other available information, become more relevant as an 
investigation progresses. Compliance with the records maintenance 
criteria listed in the foregoing provision would require the periodic 
review of SIGTARP's investigative records to insure that the records 
maintained in the system remain timely, accurate, relevant, and 
complete.
    (11) 5 U.S.C. 552a(e)(8) requires an agency to make reasonable 
efforts to serve notice on an individual when the agency makes any 
record on the individual available to any person under compulsory legal 
process, when such process becomes a matter of public record. The 
above-referenced systems of records should be exempted from this 
provision to avoid revealing investigative techniques and procedures 
outlined in those records and to prevent revelation of the existence of 
an ongoing investigation where there is need to keep the existence of 
the investigation secret.
    (12) 5 U.S.C. 552a(g) provides for civil remedies to an individual 
when an agency wrongfully refuses to amend a record or to review a 
request for amendment, when an agency wrongfully refuses to grant 
access to a record, when an agency fails to maintain accurate, 
relevant, timely, and complete records which are used to make a 
determination adverse to the individual, and when an agency fails to 
comply with any other provision of 5 U.S.C. 552a so as to adversely 
affect the individual. The investigatory information in the above-
referenced systems of records should be exempted from this provision to 
the extent that the civil remedies may relate to provisions of 5 U.S.C. 
552a from which this would exempt the systems of records, since there 
should be no civil remedies for failure to comply with provisions from 
which SIGTARP is exempted. Exemption from this provision will also 
protect SIGTARP from baseless civil court actions that might hamper its 
ability to collect, analyze, and disseminate investigative, 
intelligence, and law enforcement data.
    Under 5 U.S.C. 552a(k)(2), the head of a Federal agency may 
promulgate rules to exempt a system of records from certain provisions 
of 5 U.S.C. 552a if the system of records is ``investigatory material 
compiled for law enforcement purposes, other than material within the 
scope of subsection (j)(2).'' To the extent that these systems of 
records contain investigative material within the provisions of 5 
U.S.C. 552a(k)(2), the Department of the Treasury proposes to exempt 
the following systems of records from various provisions of the Privacy 
Act pursuant to 5 U.S.C. 552a(k)(2):
    DO .220--SIGTARP Hotline Database.
    DO .221--SIGTARP Correspondence Database.
    DO .222--SIGTARP Investigative MIS Database.
    DO .223--SIGTARP Investigative Files Database.
    DO .224--SIGTARP Audit Files Database.
    The proposed exemption under 5 U.S.C. 552a(k)(2) for the above-
referenced systems of records is from provisions 5 U.S.C. 552a(c)(3), 
(d)(1), (d)(2), (d)(3), (d)(4), (e)(1), (e)(4)(G), (e)(4)(H), 
(e)(4)(I), and (f).
    The following are the reasons why the investigative material 
contained in the above-referenced systems of records maintained by 
SIGTARP may be exempted from various provisions pursuant to 5 U.S.C. 
552a(k)(2).
    (1) 5 U.S.C. 552a(c)(3) requires an agency to make accountings of 
disclosures of a record available to the individual named in the record 
upon his or her request. The accountings must state the date, nature, 
and purpose of disclosures of the record and the names and addresses of 
recipients. Making accountings of disclosures available to the subjects 
of investigations would alert them to the fact that SIGTARP is 
conducting an investigation into their activities as well as identify 
the nature, scope, and purpose of that investigation. The subjects of 
investigations, if provided an accounting of disclosures, would be able 
to take measures to avoid detection or apprehension by destroying or 
concealing evidence that would form the basis for detection or 
apprehension.
    (2) 5 U.S.C. 552a(d)(1), (e)(4)(H), and (f)(2), (3), and (5) grant 
individuals access, or concern procedures by which an individual may 
gain access, to records pertaining to them. Disclosure of this 
information to the subjects of investigations would provide individuals 
with information concerning the nature and scope of any current 
investigation, may enable them to avoid detection or apprehension, may 
enable them to destroy or alter evidence of criminal conduct that would 
form the basis for their arrest, and could impede or impair SIGTARP's 
ability to investigate the matter. In addition, permitting access to 
investigative files and records could disclose the identity of 
confidential sources and the nature of the information supplied by 
informants as well as endanger the physical safety of those sources by 
exposing them to possible reprisals for having provided the 
information. Confidential sources and informers might refuse to provide 
SIGTARP with valuable information unless they believe that their 
identities would not be revealed through disclosure of their names or 
the nature of the information they supplied. Loss of access to such 
sources would seriously impair SIGTARP's ability to perform its law 
enforcement responsibilities. Furthermore, providing access to records 
contained in the systems of records could reveal the identities of 
undercover law enforcement officers who compiled information regarding 
the individual's criminal activities, thereby endangering the physical 
safety of those undercover officers by exposing them to possible 
reprisals. Permitting access in keeping with these provisions would 
also discourage other law enforcement and regulatory agencies, foreign 
or domestic, from freely sharing information with SIGTARP and thus 
would restrict its access to information necessary to accomplish its 
mission most effectively.
    (3) 5 U.S.C. 552a(d)(2), (3), and (4), (e)(4)(H), and (f)(4) permit 
an individual to request amendment of a record pertaining to the 
individual or concern related procedures, and require the agency either 
to amend the record or to note the disputed portion of the record, and 
to provide a copy of the individual's statement of disagreement with 
the agency's refusal to amend a record to persons or other agencies to

[[Page 2089]]

whom the record is thereafter disclosed. Since these provisions depend 
upon the individual having access to his or her records, and since an 
exemption from the provisions of 5 U.S.C. 552a relating to access to 
records is proposed for the reasons set out in the preceding paragraph 
of this section, these provisions should not apply to the above-listed 
systems of records.
    (4) 5 U.S.C. 552a(e)(1) requires an agency to maintain in its 
records only such information about an individual as is relevant and 
necessary to accomplish a purpose of the agency required to be 
accomplished by statute or Executive Order. The term ``maintain,'' as 
defined in 5 U.S.C. 552a(a)(3), includes ``collect'' and 
``disseminate.'' The application of this provision could impair 
SIGTARP's ability to collect and disseminate valuable law enforcement 
information. In the early stages of an investigation, it may be 
impossible to determine whether information collected is relevant and 
necessary, and information that initially appears irrelevant and 
unnecessary often may, upon further evaluation or upon review of 
information developed subsequently, prove particularly relevant and 
necessary to the investigation. Compliance with the records maintenance 
provisions would require SIGTARP to periodically update the 
investigatory information it collects and maintains to ensure that the 
records in these systems remain timely, accurate, and complete. 
Further, SIGTARP oftentimes will uncover evidence of violations of law 
that fall within the investigative jurisdiction of other law 
enforcement agencies. To promote effective law enforcement, SIGTARP 
will refer this evidence to other law enforcement agencies, including 
State, local, and foreign agencies, that have jurisdiction over the 
offenses to which the information relates. If required to adhere to the 
provisions of 5 U.S.C. 552a(e)(1), SIGTARP might be placed in the 
position of having to ignore information relating to violations of law 
not within its jurisdiction when that information comes to SIGTARP's 
attention during the collection and analysis of information in its 
records.
    (5) 5 U.S.C. 552a(e)(4)(G) and (f)(1) enable individuals to inquire 
whether a system of records contains records pertaining to them. 
Application of these provisions to the above-referenced systems of 
records could allow individuals to learn whether they have been 
identified as subjects of investigation. Access to such knowledge would 
impair SIGTARP's ability to carry out its mission, since individuals 
could take steps to avoid detection and destroy or hide evidence needed 
to prove the violation.
    (6) 5 U.S.C. 552a(e)(4)(I) requires an agency to publish a general 
notice listing the categories of sources for information contained in a 
system of records. Revealing sources of information could disclose 
investigative techniques and procedures, result in threats or reprisals 
against confidential informants by the subjects of investigations, and 
cause confidential informants to refuse to give full information to 
criminal investigators for fear of having their identities as sources 
disclosed.
    Any information from a system of records for which an exemption is 
claimed under 5 U.S.C. 552a(j) or (k) which is also included in another 
system of records retains the same exempt status such information has 
in the system for which such exemption is claimed.
    This proposed rule is not a ``significant regulatory action'' under 
Executive Order 12866.
    Pursuant to the requirements of the Regulatory Flexibility Act 
(RFA), 5 U.S.C. 601-612, it is hereby certified that this rule will not 
have significant economic impact on a substantial number of small 
entities. The term ``small entity'' is defined to have the same meaning 
as the terms ``small business'', ``small organization'' and ``small 
governmental jurisdiction'' as defined in the RFA.
    The proposed regulation, issued under section 522a(j)(2) and (k) of 
the Privacy Act, is to exempt certain information maintained by the 
Department in the above systems of records from notification, access 
and amendment of a record by individuals who are citizens of the United 
States or an alien lawfully admitted for permanent residence. In as 
much as the Privacy Act rights are personal and apply only to U.S. 
citizens or an alien lawfully admitted for permanent residence, small 
entities, as defined in the RFA, are not provided rights under the 
Privacy Act and are outside the scope of this regulation.
