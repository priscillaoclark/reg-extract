November 5, 2024.
    On April 29, 2024, the New York Stock Exchange LLC (``NYSE'' or

(``Commission''), pursuant to Section 19(b)(1) of the Securities 
Exchange Act of 1934 (``Act'') \1\ and Rule 19b-4 thereunder,\2\ a 
proposed rule change to amend Section 703.12(II) of the NYSE Listed 
Company Manual to expand the circumstances under which rights may be 
listed on the NYSE by allowing issuers to (i) issue rights to more than 
existing shareholders for a class of securities that is listed or to be 
listed on the Exchange, and (ii) list and trade rights on the Exchange 
prior to listing the security into which such rights will be 
exercisable. The proposed rule change was published for comment in the 
Federal Register on May 15, 2024.\3\ On June 26, 2024, pursuant to 
Section 19(b)(2) of the Act,\4\ the Commission designated a longer 
period within which to approve the proposed rule change, disapprove the 
proposed rule change, or institute proceedings to determine whether to 
disapprove the proposed rule change.\5\ On August 19, 2024, the 
Commission instituted proceedings pursuant to Section 19(b)(2)(B) of 
the Act \6\ to determine whether to approve or disapprove the proposed 
rule change.\7\ The Commission has received no comment letters on the

rule change so that it has sufficient time to consider the proposed 
rule change. Accordingly, the Commission, pursuant to Section 19(b)(2) 
of the Act,\10\ designates January 10, 2025 as the date by which the 
Commission shall either approve or disapprove the proposed rule change 
(File No. SR-NYSE-2024-23).
