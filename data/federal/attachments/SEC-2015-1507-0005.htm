SECURITIES AND EXCHANGE COMMISSION

[SEC File No. 270-442, OMB Control No. 3235-0498]


Proposed Collection; Comment Request; Extension: Rule 17a-12

Upon Written Request, Copies Available From: Securities and Exchange 
Commission, Office of FOIA Services, 100 F Street NE, Washington, DC 
20549-2736

    Notice is hereby given that pursuant to the Paperwork Reduction Act 
of 1995 (``PRA'') (44 U.S.C. 3501 et seq.), the Securities and Exchange 
Commission (``Commission'') is soliciting comments on the existing 
collection of information provided for in Rule 17a-12 (17 CFR 240.17a-
12) and Part II of Form X-17A-5 (17 CFR 249.617) under the Securities 
Exchange Act of 1934 (15 U.S.C. 78a et seq.). The Commission plans to 
submit this existing collection of information to the Office of 
Management and Budget (``OMB'') for extension and approval.
    Rule 17a-12 is the reporting rule tailored specifically for over-
the-counter (``OTC'') derivatives dealers registered with the 
Commission, and Part II of Form X-17A-5, the Financial and Operational 
Combined Uniform Single (``FOCUS'') Report, is the basic document for 
reporting the financial and operational condition of OTC derivatives 
dealers. Rule 17a-12 requires registered OTC derivatives dealers to 
file Part II of the FOCUS Report quarterly. Rule 17a-12 also requires 
that OTC derivatives dealers file audited reports annually.
    The reports required under Rule 17a-12 provide the Commission with 
information used to monitor the operations of OTC derivatives dealers 
and to enforce their compliance with the Commission's rules. These 
reports also enable the Commission to review the business activities of 
OTC derivatives dealers and to anticipate, where possible, how these 
dealers may be affected by significant economic events.
    The Commission estimates that the total hour burden under Rule 17a-
12 is approximately 540 hours per year, and the total cost burden is 
approximately $138,900 per year.
    Written comments are invited on: (a) whether the proposed 
collection of information is necessary for the proper performance of 
the functions of the Commission, including whether the information 
shall have practical utility; (b) the accuracy of the Commission's 
estimate of the burden of the proposed collection of information; (c) 
ways to enhance the quality, utility, and clarity of the information to 
be collected; and (d) ways to minimize the burden of the collection of 
information on respondents, including through the use of automated 
collection techniques or other forms of information technology. 
Consideration will be given to comments and suggestions submitted by 
September 23, 2024.
    An agency may not conduct or sponsor, and a person is not required 
to respond to, a collection of information unless it displays a 
currently valid OMB control number.
    Please direct your written comments to: Austin Gerig, Director/
Chief Data Officer, Securities and Exchange Commission, c/o Oluwaseun 
Ajayi, 100 F Street NE, Washington, DC 20549, or send an email to:
