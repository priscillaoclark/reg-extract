Source: FDIC.
Note: The estimated annual IC time burden is the product, rounded to the nearest hour, of the estimated annual
  number of responses and the estimated time per response for a given IC. The estimated annual number of
  responses is the product, rounded to the nearest whole number, of the estimated annual number of respondents
  and the estimated annual number of responses per respondent. This methodology ensures the estimated annual
  burdens in the table are consistent with the values recorded in OMB's consolidated information system.
