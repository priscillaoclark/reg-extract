November 27, 2023.
    On May 23, 2023, NYSE Arca, Inc. (``NYSE Arca'' or ``Exchange'') 
filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission (``Commission''), 
pursuant to Section 19(b)(1) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 
(``Act'') \1\ and Rule 19b-4 thereunder,\2\ a proposed rule change to 
list and trade shares of the COtwo Advisors Physical European Carbon 
Allowance Trust under NYSE Arca Rule 8.201-E. The proposed rule change 
was published for comment in the Federal Register on June 12, 2023.\3\

    \3\ See Securities Exchange Act Release No. 97653 (June 6, 
2023), 88 FR 38110.
---------------------------------------------------------------------------

    On July 25, 2023, pursuant to Section 19(b)(2) of the Act,\4\ the 
Commission designated a longer period within which to approve the 
proposed rule change, disapprove the proposed rule change, or institute 
proceedings to determine whether to disapprove the proposed rule 
change.\5\ On September 6, 2023, the Commission instituted proceedings 
pursuant to Section 19(b)(2)(B) of the Act \6\ to determine whether to 
approve or disapprove the proposed rule change.\7\ On September 29, 
2023, the Exchange submitted Amendment No. 1 to the proposed rule 
change, and on October 20, 2023, the Exchange withdrew Amendment No. 1. 
The Commission has not received any comment letters on the proposal.

---------------------------------------------------------------------------

    Section 19(b)(2) of the Act \8\ provides that, after initiating 
disapproval proceedings, the Commission shall issue an order approving 
or disapproving the proposed rule change not later than 180 days after 
the date of publication of notice of filing of the proposed rule 
change. The Commission may extend the period for issuing an order 
approving or disapproving the proposed rule change, however, by not 
more than 60 days if the Commission determines that a longer period is 
appropriate and publishes the reasons for such determination. The 
proposed rule change was published for notice and comment in the 
Federal Register on June 12, 2023. December 9, 2023 is 180 days from 
that date, and February 7, 2024 is 240 days from that date.

    The Commission finds it appropriate to designate a longer period 
within which to issue an order approving or disapproving the proposed 
rule change so that it has sufficient time to consider the proposed 
rule change. Accordingly, the Commission, pursuant to Section 19(b)(2) 
of the Act,\9\ designates February 7, 2024 as the date by which the 
Commission shall either approve or disapprove the proposed rule change 
(File No. SR-NYSEARCA-2023-37).
