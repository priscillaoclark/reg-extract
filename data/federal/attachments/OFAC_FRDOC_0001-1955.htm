Updating Provisions Related to Blocking and Other Actions Related 
to Specific Property or Interests in Property

AGENCY: Office of Foreign Assets Control, Treasury.

ACTION: Final rule.

-----------------------------------------------------------------------

SUMMARY: The Department of the Treasury's Office of Foreign Assets 
Control (OFAC) is adopting a final rule to clarify OFAC's process for 
issuing certain orders that block or identify as blocked specific 
property or interests in property, or that impose other prohibitions 
less than full blocking with respect to specific property or interests 
in property. OFAC is adding information about these orders in 
regulatory notes in 35 of OFAC's sanctions regulations.

DATES: This rule is effective September 17, 2024.

Background

    In this rule, OFAC is updating 35 parts of 31 CFR chapter V to 
clarify OFAC's processes when it issues certain

[[Page 75956]]

orders that block or identify as blocked specific property or interests 
in property, or that impose other non-blocking prohibitions with 
respect to specific property or interests in property.

International Emergency Economic Powers Act

    The 35 parts of 31 CFR chapter V that are the subject of this rule 
implement OFAC's authority to block the property and interests in 
property of persons pursuant to, among other authorities, the 
International Emergency Economic Powers Act, 50 U.S.C. 1701 et seq. 
(IEEPA).
    IEEPA includes authority to investigate, block during the pendency 
of an investigation, regulate, direct and compel, nullify, void, 
prevent or prohibit, any acquisition, holding, withholding, use, 
transfer, withdrawal, transportation, importation or exportation of, or 
dealing in, or exercising any right, power, or privilege with respect 
to, or transaction involving, any property in which any foreign country 
or a national thereof has any interest by any person, or with respect 
to any property, subject to the jurisdiction of the United States. 50 
U.S.C. 1702(a)(1)(B). Other statutes provide similar authority.
    OFAC's actions rely on the President's delegation of those 
authorities under one or more Executive orders. Such orders typically 
authorize the Secretary of the Treasury to designate persons who meet 
specified criteria, and they provide that all property and interests in 
property within U.S. jurisdiction of such persons is blocked. These 
orders also authorize the Secretary of the Treasury, in consultation 
with the Secretary of State, to take such actions and to employ all 
powers granted to the President under IEEPA or other applicable 
statutory authorities as may be necessary to carry out their purpose, 
and they provide that blocking prohibitions apply except to the extent 
provided in regulations, orders, directives, or licenses OFAC may 
issue. See, e.g., section 1(d) of Executive Order (E.O.) 14024.

Actions With Respect to Specific Property or Interests in Property

    The most common way OFAC exercises its authority is by designating 
a person and placing that person on OFAC's Specially Designated 
Nationals and Blocked Persons List (SDN List). Once designated, all 
property and interests in property subject to U.S. jurisdiction of the 
designated person are blocked, and U.S. persons are generally 
prohibited from engaging in transactions involving any property or 
interest in property of the designated person. However, in certain 
cases, OFAC may exercise its authority in narrower ways. These actions 
include issuing orders or directives that impose prohibitions less than 
fully blocking the entirety of a person's property and interests in 
property as circumstances require. Such tailored actions are based on a 
combination of OFAC's authority to block all property of a designated 
person and its authority to narrow the scope of such broad prohibitions 
through orders, directives, or licenses.
    This rule identifies three forms that such actions by OFAC may 
take: (1) identifying property or interests in property as blocked 
pursuant to OFAC's authority due to an interest of an already blocked 
person, including where such interest may not be apparent to the 
public; (2) blocking specific property or interests in property of a 
person who is not already blocked but whom OFAC is investigating for 
potential designation; and (3) blocking or imposing other prohibitions 
with respect to a person's specific property or interests in property 
less than full blocking sanctions.
    First, OFAC may act to aid relevant parties by identifying the 
property or interests in property of already blocked persons, 
particularly in cases in which OFAC has access to information 
supporting its determination that a blocked person has an interest in 
specific property. In such cases, OFAC may identify specific property 
in which OFAC determines a blocked person has an interest and issue an 
order to financial institutions or other persons in possession or 
control of such property to block such property. OFAC may also exercise 
its blocking authorities in this manner upon review of financial 
transaction information received from U.S. financial institutions 
following OFAC's requirements that such financial institutions provide 
reports about accounts or transactions that meet specified criteria. 
See note 1 to 31 CFR 501.602.
    Second, OFAC may identify property or interests in property of a 
person who is not blocked, but whom OFAC is investigating for potential 
designation. To ensure that this property or interest in property is 
not transferred before OFAC designates the person, OFAC may issue an 
order to financial institutions or other persons in possession or 
control of such property or interest in property to block it pending 
investigation.
    Third, in certain other cases, OFAC may block or impose other 
prohibitions with respect to specific property or interests in property 
less than full blocking sanctions. For example, OFAC may consider 
designating a person but determine U.S. national security or foreign 
policy interests are better served by prohibitions that may be narrower 
than blocking the entirety of the person's property and interests in 
property. In such cases, OFAC would determine that a person meets the 
criteria for designation but would take action less than blocking the 
entirety of a person's property and interests in property. This action 
may take various forms, including an order to the financial 
institutions or other persons in possession or control of the specific 
property or interests in property or a directive imposing non-blocking 
restrictions. For example, in 2014 OFAC issued directives pursuant to 
sec. 1(b) of Executive Order 13662 that prohibited certain dealings in 
debt and equity of persons operating in those sectors of the Russian 
Federation economy identified by the Secretary of the Treasury pursuant 
to sec. 1(a)(i) of Executive Order 13662.

Provision of Notice

    Persons affected by any type of OFAC prohibition should have an 
opportunity to understand the nature of OFAC's action and its impact on 
their property or interests in property. The form of notice may differ 
depending on the type of action OFAC takes or order it issues and the 
specific facts of an action.
    OFAC may publish notice of its action in the Federal Register, 
which provides the public with constructive notice of the action. This 
is the form of notice OFAC uses for designation actions because it 
ensures that anyone who may come into contact with a designated person 
or their property or interests in property is aware of the designation.
    When OFAC takes more tailored action with respect to specific 
property or interests in property, the public may not always require 
notice of the action through publication in the Federal Register, and 
it may be more appropriate to provide actual notice specifically to a 
person affected by the prohibition. OFAC may do so by providing written 
notice of OFAC's order to one or more persons OFAC assesses to have an 
interest in the property based on available information. OFAC may 
provide such notice directly to such affected persons or indirectly 
through financial institutions or other transaction intermediaries, who 
would be required to notify the affected persons with whom the 
recipient maintains direct commercial relationships. In many cases, 
requiring a transaction intermediary to disclose a blocking order may 
be the most efficient

[[Page 75957]]

and effective means of providing notice because a transaction 
intermediary maintains direct commercial relationships through which 
affected persons may inquire about the status of their funds.\1\
---------------------------------------------------------------------------

    \1\ OFAC's authority to ``regulate'' transactions includes the 
authority to require a participant in a transaction who is subject 
to U.S. jurisdiction to provide notice to its direct commercial 
counterparts when the transaction is blocked. 50 U.S.C. 
1702(a)(1)(B).
---------------------------------------------------------------------------

Current Regulatory Action

    This rule amends notes to the blocking provisions in subpart B of 
OFAC's regulations in 35 parts of 31 CFR chapter V (the ``subject 
parts''). The blocking provisions are in Sec.  ___.201 in the following 
parts of 31 CFR: 510, 525, 526, 536, 542, 544, 546, 547, 548, 549, 550, 
551, 552, 553, 555, 558, 562, 569, 570, 576, 578, 579, 582, 583, 584, 
585, 587, 588, 589, 590, 591, 594, and 599. In part 536, in addition to 
amending Sec.  536.201, OFAC is amending notes to Sec.  536.312, the 
definition of specially designated narcotics trafficker, because that 
definition discusses blocked property and blocking orders. In part 560, 
the blocking provisions are in Sec.  560.211. In part 598, the blocking 
provisions are in Sec.  598.202, and in addition to amending that 
section, OFAC is amending Sec.  598.314, the definition of specially 
designated narcotics trafficker, because that definition discusses 
blocked property and blocking orders.
    Specifically, this rule adds a note to the subject parts describing 
the three types of actions OFAC may take with respect to specific 
property or interests in property, the forms of notice that OFAC may 
use, and how affected persons can contact OFAC with inquiries about 
these actions.
    Additionally, this rule amends an existing note to the subject 
parts regarding OFAC's blocking of property and interests in property 
pending investigation. OFAC is amending the note to make clear that the 
procedure of publishing the names of persons blocked during the 
pendency of an investigation in the Federal Register will not 
necessarily apply when OFAC takes an action to block specific property 
or interests in property pending investigation.
    Finally, OFAC is updating the note in the subject parts that 
explains the procedures for seeking release of blocked property or 
administrative reconsideration of OFAC actions to add information about 
additional unblocking procedures available to blocked or otherwise 
affected persons. In certain parts, OFAC is making other technical or 
other conforming updates to the notes.

Public Participation

    Because the Regulations involve a foreign affairs function, the 
provisions of E.O. 12866 of September 30, 1993, ``Regulatory Planning 
and Review'' (58 FR 51735, October 4, 1993), as amended, and the 
Administrative Procedure Act (5 U.S.C. 553) requiring notice of 
proposed rulemaking, opportunity for public participation, and delay in 
effective date are inapplicable. Because no notice of proposed 
rulemaking is required for this rule, the Regulatory Flexibility Act (5 
U.S.C. 601-612) does not apply.

Paperwork Reduction Act

    The collections of information related to the Regulations are 
contained in 31 CFR part 501 (the ``Reporting, Procedures and Penalties 
Regulations''). Pursuant to the Paperwork Reduction Act of 1995 (44 
U.S.C. 3507), those collections of information have been approved by 
the Office of Management and Budget under control number 1505-0164. An 
agency may not conduct or sponsor, and a person is not required to 
respond to, a collection of information unless the collection of 
information displays a valid control number.

576, 578, 579, 582, 583, 584, 585, 587, 588, 589, 590, 591, 594,
