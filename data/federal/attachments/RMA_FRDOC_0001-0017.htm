Eligibility for ADD PAY Program

    To be eligible for additional payment under the ADD PAY Program, 
the participant must be an AIP who administered one or more eligible 
crop insurance contracts for specialty crops for the 2021 reinsurance 
year. A complete list of the specialty crops eligible for the ADD PAY 
Program can be found on the RMA website at <a href="https://www.rma.usda.gov/en/Topics/Specialty-Crops">https://www.rma.usda.gov/en/Topics/Specialty-Crops</a>.

Funding Available for ADD PAY Program

    The total funding available for the ADD PAY Program is $25 million. 
Funds from section 771 of the Consolidated Appropriations Act, 2023, 
(Pub. L. 117-328) will be used for the ADD PAY Program.

Calculating and Accounting ADD PAY Program Amounts

    The ADD Pay Program amount for each AIP will be equal to the 
difference between the amount to be paid pursuant to the SRA for 
qualifying crop insurance contracts and the amount that would be paid 
if such contracts were not subject to a reduction described in section 
III(a)(2)(G) of the SRA but subject to a reimbursement rate equal to 
17.5 percent of the net book premium.
    If the total additional payment sum of $25 million for the ADD PAY 
Program is reached or may be reached, the RMA Administrator will 
prorate ADD PAY amounts due so that a total of $25 million is paid. In 
such a case, funding for the ADD PAY Program will be distributed to 
AIPs proportionally based on their respective liability for qualifying 
crop insurance contracts.
    The ADD PAY Program will be administered based on the book of 
business at first annual settlement date for the 2021 reinsurance year. 
The payment will be final upon receipt and will not be altered based on 
any subsequent updates to premium or

[[Page 27434]]

liability of qualifying crop insurance contracts made after that date.
    Specifically, RMA will calculate the additional payment amounts 
under the ADD PAY Program as follows:
    (1) For each qualifying crop insurance contract subject to a 
reduction described in section III(a)(2)(G) of the SRA,\1\ calculate 
17.5 percent of net book premium;
---------------------------------------------------------------------------

    \1\ See 2021 Standard Reinsurance Agreement at: <a href="https://www.rma.usda.gov/-/media/RMA/Regulations/Appendix-2021/21sra.ashx?la=en">https://www.rma.usda.gov/-/media/RMA/Regulations/Appendix-2021/21sra.ashx?la=en</a>.
---------------------------------------------------------------------------

    (2) If the result of (1) is greater than the actual A&O subsidy 
paid for the qualifying crop insurance contract:
    (a) Subtract the actual A&O subsidy paid from the result of (1);
    (b) Calculate total liability;
    (3) Sum the results of (2a) by AIP;
    (4) Sum the results of (3) across all AIPs;
    (5) If the result of (4) is less than or equal to $25 million, then 
pay each AIP their respective amount from (3);
    (6) If the result of (4) is greater than $25 million, then:
    (a) Sum the results of (2b) by AIP;
    (b) Sum the results of (6a) across all AIPs;
    (c) Divide (6a) by (6b) to establish each AIP's proportion of total 
liability;
    (d) Multiply $25 million by the result of (6c) for each AIP; and
    (e) Pay each AIP their respective amount from (6d).

Paperwork Reduction Act Requirements

    In accordance with the provisions of the Paperwork Reduction Act of 
1995 (44 U.S.C. chapter 35, subchapter I), the notice does not change 
the information collection approved by OMB under control numbers 0563-
0053.

Environmental Review

    The environmental impacts of this final rule have been considered 
in a manner consistent with the provisions of the National 
Environmental Policy Act (NEPA, 42 U.S.C. 4321-4347), the regulations 
of the Council on Environmental Quality (40 CFR parts 1500-1508), and 
because USDA will be making the payments to producers, the USDA 
regulation for compliance with NEPA (7 CFR part 1b). As specified in 7 
CFR 1b.4, FCIC is categorically excluded from the preparation of an 
Environmental Assessment or Environmental Impact Statement unless the 
FCIC Manager (agency head) determines that an action may have a 
significant environmental effect. The FCIC Manager has determined this 
notice will not have a significant environmental effect. Therefore, 
FCIC will not prepare an environmental assessment or environmental 
impact statement for this action, and this notice serves as 
documentation of the programmatic environmental compliance decision.
