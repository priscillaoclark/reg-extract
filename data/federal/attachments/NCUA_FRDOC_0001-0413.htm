SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION: 
    OMB Number: 3133-0067.
    Title: Corporate Credit Union Monthly Call Report and Annual Report 
of Officers.
    Type of Review: Revision of a currently approved collection.
    Abstract: Section 202(a)(1) of the Federal Credit Union Act (Act) 
requires federally insured credit unions to make reports of condition 
to the NCUA Board upon dates selected by it. Corporate credit unions 
report this information monthly on NCUA Form 5310, also known as the 
Corporate Credit Union Call Report. The financial and statistical 
information is essential to NCUA in carrying out its responsibility for 
supervising corporate credit unions. The Federal Credit Union Act, 12 
U.S.C. 1762, specifically requires federal credit unions to report the 
identity of credit union officials. Section 741.6(a) requires 
federally-insured credit unions to submit a Report of Officials 
annually to NCUA containing the annual certification of compliance with 
security requirements. The branch information is requested under the 
authority of Sec.  741.6 of the NCUA Rules and Regulations. NCUA 
utilizes the information to monitor financial conditions in corporate 
credit unions, and to allocate supervision and examination resources.
    Affected Public: Private Sector: Not-for-profit institutions.
    Estimated Number of Respondents: 11.

record. The public is invited to submit comments concerning: (a) 
whether the collection of information is necessary for the proper 
performance of the function of the agency, including whether the 
information will have practical utility; (b) the accuracy of the 
agency's estimate of the burden of the collection of information, 
including the validity of the methodology and assumptions used; (c) 
ways to enhance the quality, utility, and clarity of the information to

the information on the respondents, including the use of automated 
collection techniques or other forms of information technology.
