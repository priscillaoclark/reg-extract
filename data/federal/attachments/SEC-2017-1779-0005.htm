SECURITIES AND EXCHANGE COMMISSION

[SEC File No. 270-399, OMB Control No. 3235-0456]


Submission for OMB Review; Comment Request; Extension: Form 24F-2

Upon Written Request, Copies Available From: Securities and Exchange 
Commission, Office of FOIA Services, 100 F Street NE, Washington, DC 
20549-2736.

    Notice is hereby given that pursuant to the Paperwork Reduction Act 
of 1995 (44 U.S.C. 3501-3520), the Securities and Exchange Commission 
(the ``Commission'') has submitted to the Office of Management and 
Budget a request for extension of the previously approved collection of 
information discussed below.
    Rule 24f-2 (17 CFR 270.24f-2) under the Investment Company Act of 
1940 (15 U.S.C. 80a) requires any open-end management companies 
(``mutual funds''), unit investment trusts (``UITs''), registered 
closed-end investment companies that make periodic repurchase offers 
under rule 23c-3 under the Investment Company Act [17 CFR 270.23c-3] 
(``interval funds''), or face-amount certificate companies 
(collectively, ``funds'') deemed to have registered an indefinite 
amount of securities to file, not later than 90 days after the end of 
any fiscal year in which it has publicly offered such securities, Form 
24F-2 (17 CFR 274.24) with the Commission. Form 24F-2 is the annual 
notice of securities sold by funds that accompanies the payment of 
registration fees with respect to the securities sold during the fiscal 
year.
    The Commission estimates that 2,074 funds file Form 24F-2 on the 
required annual basis. The average annual burden per respondent for 
Form 24F-2 is estimated to be four hours. The total annual burden for 
all respondents to

[[Page 18991]]

Form 24F-2 is estimated to be 8,296 hours. The estimate of average 
burden hours is made solely for the purposes of the Paperwork Reduction 
Act, and is not derived from a comprehensive or even a representative 
survey or study of the costs of Commission rules.
    Compliance with the collection of information required by Form 24F-
2 is mandatory. The Form 24F-2 filing that must be made to the 
Commission is available to the public. An agency may not conduct or 
sponsor, and a person is not required to respond to, a collection of 
information unless it displays a currently valid control number.
    The public may view background documentation for this information 
collection at the following website: <a href="http://www.reginfo.gov">www.reginfo.gov</a>. Find this 
particular information collection by selecting ``Currently under 30-day 
Review--Open for Public Comments'' or by using the search function.

by April 15, 2024 to (i) <a href="/cdn-cgi/l/email-protection#d8959a80f697959af697918a99f68b9d9b87bcbdabb387b7bebeb1bbbdaa98b7b5baf6bdb7a8f6bfb7ae"><span class="__cf_email__" data-cfemail="276a657f09686a6509686e756609746264784342544c784841414e44425567484a450942485709404851">[email&#160;protected]</span></a> and
