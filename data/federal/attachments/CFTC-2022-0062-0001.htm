SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION: Under the PRA, 44 U.S.C. 3501 et seq., 
Federal agencies must obtain approval from OMB for each collection of 
information they conduct or sponsor. ``Collection of information'' is 
defined in 44 U.S.C. 3502(3) and 5 CFR 1320.3(c) and includes agency 
requests or requirements that members of the public submit reports, 
keep records, or provide information to a third party. The Federal 
Register notice with a 60-day comment period soliciting comments on 
this collection of information was published on July 01, 2022 (87 FR 
39501).
    Title: Procurement Contracts (OMB Control No. 3038-0031). This is a 
request for an extension of a currently approved information 
collection.
    Abstract: The information collected under this request is gathered 
through the use of forms specific to a contract or contracting action. 
The standard forms are prescribed for use for non-personal services, 
construction, award of contracts and solicitations by agencies in 
connection with the procurement of supplies, purchase and delivery 
orders, specified in the Federal Acquisition Regulations (48 CFR 1-53). 
The information provided on the forms is specific and generally does 
not require additional information or questions.
    An agency may not conduct or sponsor, and a person is not required 
to respond to, a collection of information unless it displays a 
currently valid OMB control number.\2\ On July 1, 2022, the Commission 
published in the Federal Register notice of the proposed extension of 
this information collection and provided 60 days for public comment on 
the proposed extension, 87 FR 39501 (``60-Day Notice''). The Commission 
did not receive any relevant comments on the 60-Day Notice.

burden for this collection to reflect changed circumstances below.
    The information collection consists of procurement activities 
relating to solicitations, amendments to solicitations, requests for 
quotations, construction contracts, awards of contracts, performance 
bonds, and payment information for individuals (vendors) or contractors 
engaged in providing supplies or services.
