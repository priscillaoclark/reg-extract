SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION: 
    Title: Exemption from Derivatives Clearing Organization 
Registration (OMB Control No. 3038-0117). This is a request for 
approval for an existing collection in use without a currently approved 
OMB control number.
    Abstract: This information collection is associated with CFTC 
regulations codifying the policies and procedures that the Commission 
follows with respect to granting exemptions from registration as a DCO 
for the clearing of proprietary swaps for U.S. persons and futures 
commission merchants (``FCMs''). The rules include reporting 
requirements that are collections of information requiring approval 
under the PRA. Specifically, Commission regulation 39.6 specifies the 
conditions and procedures under which a clearing organization may apply 
for exemption from registration as a DCO, the information that must be 
provided to the Commission to obtain and maintain such exemption, and 
procedures for termination of an exemption. See 17 CFR 39.6. The 
information that is collected under these regulations is necessary for 
the Commission to determine whether a clearing organization qualifies 
for exemption from DCO registration, to evaluate the continued 
eligibility of the exempt DCO for exemption from registration, to 
review compliance by the exempt DCO with any conditions of such 
exemption, or to conduct its oversight of U.S. persons and the swaps 
that are cleared by U.S. persons through the exempt DCO.
    An agency may not conduct or sponsor, and a person is not required 
to respond to, a collection of information unless it displays a 
currently valid OMB control number. On May 30, 2023, the Commission 
published in the Federal Register notice of the proposed extension of 
this information collection and provided 60 days for public comment on 
the proposed extension, 88 FR 34489. The Commission received no 
relevant comments that addressed its PRA burden estimates.
    Burden Statement: The provisions of part 39 of the CFTC's 
Regulations include reporting requirements that constitute information 
collections within the meaning of the PRA. With respect to the ongoing 
reporting obligations associated with exemption from DCO registration, 
the CFTC believes that exempt DCOs incur an aggregate annual time-
burden of 257 hours.
    Respondents/Affected Entities: Derivatives Clearing Organizations.
    Estimated number of respondents: 9.
    Estimated average burden hours per respondent: 29 hours.\2\
---------------------------------------------------------------------------

    \2\ Average burden hours per respondent rounded to the nearest 
full hour.
---------------------------------------------------------------------------

    Estimated total annual burden hours on respondents: 257 hours.
    Frequency of collection: On occasion.

    There are no capital costs or operating and maintenance costs 
associated with this collection.

(Authority: 44 U.S.C. 3501 et seq.)
