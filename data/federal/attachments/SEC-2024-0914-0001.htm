I. Self-Regulatory Organization's Statement of the Terms of Substance 
of the Proposed Rule Change

    The Exchange is filing a proposal to amend Interpretation and 
Policy .01 to Exchange Rule 1903, Continuing Education, to reopen the 
period by which eligible Members \3\ who participate in the Maintaining 
Qualifications Program (``MQP'') will be able to complete their 
prescribed 2022 and 2023 continuing education content.
---------------------------------------------------------------------------

    \3\ The term ``Member'' means an individual or organization that 
is registered with the Exchange pursuant to Chapter II of the 
Exchange Rules for purposes of trading on the Exchange as an 
``Electronic Exchange Member'' or ``Market Maker.'' See Exchange 
Rule 100.
---------------------------------------------------------------------------

    The text of the proposed rule change is available on the Exchange's 
website at <a href="https://www.miaxglobal.com/markets/us-options/miax-options/rule-filings">https://www.miaxglobal.com/markets/us-options/miax-options/rule-filings</a>, at MIAX's principal office, and at the Commission's 
Public Reference Room.

II. Self-Regulatory Organization's Statement of the Purpose of, and the 
Statutory Basis for, the Proposed Rule Change

    In its filing with the Commission, the self-regulatory organization 
included statements concerning the purpose of, and basis for, the 
proposed rule change and discussed any comments it received on the 
proposed rule change. The text of those statements may be examined at 
the places specified in Item IV below. The Exchange has prepared 
summaries, set forth in sections A, B, and C below, of the most 
significant parts of such statements.

A. Self-Regulatory Organization's Statement of the Purpose of, and the 
Statutory Basis for, the Proposed Rule Change

1. Purpose
    The Exchange proposes to amend Interpretation and Policy .01 to 
Exchange Rule 1903, Continuing Education, to provide eligible Members 
another opportunity to elect to reopen the period by which certain 
participants in the MQP will be able to complete their prescribed 2022 
and 2023 continuing education content.
    In 2021, the Financial Industry Regulatory Authority, Inc. 
(``FINRA'') implemented rule changes, which amended its Continuing 
Education (``CE'') Program requirements to, among other things, provide 
eligible individuals who terminate any of their representative or 
principal registration categories the option of maintaining their 
qualification for any terminated registration categories by completing 
annual CE through a new program, the MQP.\4\ Under FINRA Rule 1240.01, 
the MQP designated a look-back provision that, subject to specified 
conditions, extended the option to participate in the MQP to 
individuals who: (1) were registered as a representative or principal 
within two years immediately prior to March 15, 2022 (the 
implementation date of the MQP); and (2) individuals who were 
participating in the Financial Services Affiliate Waiver Program 
(``FSAWP'') \5\ under FINRA Rule 1210.09 (Waiver of Examinations for 
Individuals Working for a Financial Services Industry Affiliate of a 
Member) immediately prior to March 15, 2022 (collectively, ``Look-Back 
Individuals'').
---------------------------------------------------------------------------

    \4\ See Securities Exchange Act Release No. 93097 (September 21, 
2021), 86 FR 53358 (September 27, 2021) (Order Approving File No. 
SR-FINRA-2021-015). Other exchanges, including the Exchange, 
subsequently filed copycat rule filings to align their continuing 
education rules with those of FINRA. See Securities Exchange Act 
Release No. 95140 (June 22, 2022), 87 FR 38438 (June 28, 2022) (SR-
MIAX-2022-23) (Notice of Filing and Immediate Effectiveness of a 
Proposed Rule Change To Amend Exchange Rule 1900, Registration 
Requirements, Exchange Rule 1903, Continuing Education Requirements, 
and Exchange Rule 1904, Electronic Filing Requirements for Uniform 
Forms).
    \5\ The FSAWP is a waiver program for eligible individuals who 
have left a member firm to work for a foreign or domestic financial 
services affiliate of a member firm. The Exchange stopped accepting 
new participants for the FSAWP beginning on July 1, 2022; however, 
individuals who were already participating in the FSAWP prior to 
that date had the option of continuing in the FSAWP.
---------------------------------------------------------------------------

    In 2023, FINRA amended FINRA Rule 1240.01, to provide Look-Back 
Individuals a second opportunity to elect to participate in the MQP 
(the ``FINRA Second Enrollment Period'').\6\ The proposed rule change 
required that Look-Back Individuals who elect to participate in the MQP 
during the FINRA Second Enrollment Period complete any prescribed 2022 
and 2023 MQP content by March 31, 2024. Look-Back Individuals who are 
enrolled in the MQP, similar to other MQP participants, are able to 
complete any prescribed CE and renew their annual MQP participation 
through their FINRA Financial Professional Gateway (``FinPro'') 
accounts.
---------------------------------------------------------------------------

    \6\ See Securities Exchange Act Release No. 97184 (Mar. 22, 
2023), 88 FR 18359 (Mar. 28, 2023) (SR-FINRA-2023-005) (Notice of 
Filing and Immediate Effectiveness of a Proposed Rule Change to 
Amend FINRA Rule 1240.01 To Provide Eligible Individuals Another 
Opportunity to Elect to Participate in the Maintaining 
Qualifications Program)
---------------------------------------------------------------------------

    In response to FINRA's rule changes and to facilitate compliance 
with the Exchange's CE Program requirements by members of multiple 
exchanges, the Exchange implemented rule changes to align with FINRA's 
CE Program.\7\ Such rules, among other things, provide eligible 
individuals who terminate any of their representative or principal 
registrations the option of maintaining their qualification for any of 
the terminated registrations by completing CE through the MQP. Further, 
Exchange Rule 1903, Interpretation and Policy .01, includes a look-back 
provision that, subject to specified conditions, extends the option for 
maintaining qualifications following a registration category 
termination to (i) individuals who have been registered as a 
representative or principal within two years immediately preceding July 
1, 2022, and (ii) individuals who have been participants of the FSAWP 
immediately preceding July 1, 2022 implementation (i.e., Look-Back 
Individuals).
---------------------------------------------------------------------------

    \7\ See Exchange Rules 1900, 1903, and 1904.
---------------------------------------------------------------------------

    Exchange Rule 1903 also provided Look-Back Individuals with a 
second enrollment period, between September 18, 2023, and December 31, 
2023 (the ``Exchange Second Enrollment Period''). Exchange Rule 1903, 
Interpretation and Policy .01, requires that Look-Back Individuals who 
elect to participate in the MQP during the Exchange Second Enrollment 
Period complete any prescribed 2022 and 2023 MQP content by March 31, 
2024.\8\
---------------------------------------------------------------------------

    \8\ The Exchange determined to treat the individuals who 
enrolled during the first period (preceding July 1, 2022) the same 
as those who enrolled during the second period (between September 
18, 2023, and December 31, 2023) for purposes of the March 31, 2024, 
deadline for completion of prescribed 2022 and 2023 CE content. This 
is because those who had enrolled in the MQP during the first period 
satisfied all of the eligibility criteria for enrollment during the 
second period and would have been able to complete their prescribed 
CE content by March 31, 2024, had they chosen to enroll during the 
second period instead of enrolling during the first period.
---------------------------------------------------------------------------

    FINRA recently submitted a proposal related to its CE Program (the 
``FINRA Rule Change'').\9\ The proposal set forth changes to FINRA Rule 
1240.01, to provide Look-Back Individuals enrolled in the MQP in both 
2022 and 2023 who did not complete their prescribed 2022 and 2023 CE 
content as of March 31, 2024, the opportunity to complete such content 
between May 22, 2024, and July 1, 2024, to be eligible to continue 
their participation in the MQP.\10\ In addition, the proposed rule 
change provides that any such individuals who will have completed their 
prescribed 2022 and 2023 CE content between March 31,

[[Page 57453]]

2024, and May 22, 2024, will be deemed to have completed such content 
by July 1, 2024, for purposes of the rule.
---------------------------------------------------------------------------

    \9\ See Securities Exchange Act Release No. 100067 (May 6, 
2024), 89 FR 40520 (May 10, 2024) (SR-FINRA-2024-006) (Notice of 
Filing and Immediate Effectiveness of a Proposed Rule Change To 
Amend FINRA Rule 1240.01 To Reopen the Period by Which Certain 
Participants in the Maintaining Qualifications Program May Complete 
Their Prescribed Continuing Education Content).
    \10\ This would include any Look-Back Individuals who were still 
in the process of completing their prescribed CE content as of March 
31, 2024.
---------------------------------------------------------------------------

    In the FINRA Rule Change, FINRA noted that it sent multiple 
reminders, including a March 16, 2024 email, to Look-Back Individuals 
who had enrolled in the MQP but had not completed their prescribed CE 
to remind them of the March 31, 2024 deadline. In the FINRA Rule 
Change, FINRA further noted that in the week leading up to the 
deadline, FINRA noticed that several thousand of those individuals were 
renewing their participation in the MQP for 2024 instead of completing 
their prescribed CE.\11\ Per the FINRA Rule Change, FINRA believes that 
some of those individuals may have been confused by the layout of their 
FinPro accounts. Specifically, if they selected the 2024 renewal 
banner, which was prominently displayed on their FinPro accounts, and 
completed the renewal process, they would not have been automatically 
redirected to complete any prescribed CE. Therefore, individuals may 
have inadvertently assumed that completion of the renewal process alone 
would have satisfied all of the necessary requirements to continue 
their participation in the MQP.\12\
---------------------------------------------------------------------------

    \11\ Look-Back Individuals who enrolled in the MQP have until 
December 31, 2024, to renew their participation in the MQP for 2024, 
provided that they complete their prescribed CE by the stated 
deadline.
    \12\ According to FINRA, a number of these individuals contacted 
FINRA to confirm whether they were required to satisfy any 
additional requirements other than completing the 2024 renewal. To 
provide FINRA with additional time to assess the situation, FINRA 
temporarily changed the March 31, 2024, due date for CE completion 
in its systems. This may have compounded the confusion because any 
Look-Back Individual who may have logged into their FinPro account 
during this time would have seen an interim CE completion date and 
would have been able to complete their prescribed CE content based 
on that interim CE completion date.
---------------------------------------------------------------------------

    For similar reasons and to facilitate compliance with the 
Exchange's CE Program requirements by members of multiple exchanges, 
the Exchange is also proposing to amend its rules (i.e., Exchange Rule 
1903, Interpretation and Policy .01) to provide Look-Back Individuals 
enrolled in the MQP in both 2022 and 2023 who did not complete their 
prescribed 2022 and 2023 CE content as of March 31, 2024, the 
opportunity to complete such content between the effective date of this 
filing, and July 1, 2024, to be eligible to continue their 
participation in the MQP.\13\ In addition, the proposed rule change 
provides that any such individuals who will have completed their 
prescribed 2022 and 2023 CE content between March 31, 2024, and the 
effective date of this filing, will be deemed to have completed such 
content by July 1, 2024, for purposes of the rule.
---------------------------------------------------------------------------

    \13\ This would include any Look-Back Individuals who were still 
in the process of completing their prescribed CE content as of March 
31, 2024.
---------------------------------------------------------------------------

2. Statutory Basis
    The Exchange believes the proposed rule change is consistent with 
the Act and the rules and regulations thereunder applicable to the 
Exchange and, in particular, the requirements of Section 6(b) of the 
Act.\14\ Specifically, the Exchange believes the proposed rule change 
is consistent with the Section 6(b)(5) \15\ requirements that the rules 
of an exchange be designed to prevent fraudulent and manipulative acts 
and practices, to promote just and equitable principles of trade, to 
foster cooperation and coordination with persons engaged in regulating, 
clearing, settling, processing information with respect to, and 
facilitating transactions in securities, to remove impediments to and 
perfect the mechanism of a free and open market and a national market 
system, and, in general, to protect investors and the public interest. 
Additionally, the Exchange believes the proposed rule change is 
consistent with the Section 6(b)(5) \16\ requirement that the rules of 
an exchange not be designed to permit unfair discrimination between 
customers, issuers, brokers, or dealers. The Exchange's rule proposal 
is intended to harmonize the Exchange's supervision rules, specifically 
with respect to the continuing education requirements with those of 
FINRA, on which they are based. Consequently, the proposed change will 
conform the Exchange's rules to changes made to corresponding FINRA 
rules, thus promoting application of consistent regulatory standards 
with respect to rules that FINRA enforces pursuant to its regulatory 
services agreement with the Exchange.

    \15\ 15 U.S.C. 78f(b)(5).
    \16\ Id.
---------------------------------------------------------------------------

    The Exchange believes that reopening the period by which Look-Back 
Individuals will be able to complete their prescribed 2022 and 2023 CE 
content is appropriate under the circumstances. As FINRA noted in the 
FINRA Rule Change, Look-Back Individuals who had enrolled in the MQP in 
2022 and 2023 but had not completed their prescribed 2022 and 2023 CE 
content by the March 31, 2024 deadline may have been confused, as 
described above. The Exchange believes that participation in the MQP 
reduces unnecessary impediments to requalification for these 
individuals without diminishing investor protection. In addition, the 
proposed rule change is consistent with other goals, such as the 
promotion of diversity and inclusion in the securities industry by 
attracting and retaining a broader and diverse group of professionals. 
The MQP also allows the industry to retain expertise from skilled 
individuals, providing investors with the advantage of greater 
experience among the individuals working in the industry. The Exchange 
believes that reopening the CE completion period, as proposed, will 
further these goals and objectives.
    Further, the Exchange believes the proposed amendments reduce the 
possibility of a regulatory gap between Exchange and FINRA rules, 
providing more uniform standards across the securities industry. The 
Exchange believes that the proposed rule change will bring consistency 
and uniformity with FINRA's recently amended CE Program, which will, in 
turn, assist members and their associated persons in complying with 
these rules and improve regulatory efficiency. The proposed rule 
changes make ministerial changes to the Exchange's CE rules to align 
them with the CE rules of FINRA, in order to prevent unnecessary 
regulatory burdens and to promote efficient administration of the 
rules.

B. Self-Regulatory Organization's Statement on Burden on Competition

    The Exchange does not believe that the proposed rule change will 
result in any burden on competition that is not necessary or 
appropriate in furtherance of the purposes of the Act. The Exchange 
believes that the proposed rule change, which harmonizes its rules with 
the recent rule change adopted by FINRA, will reduce the regulatory 
burden placed on market participants engaged in trading activities 
across different markets. The Exchange believes that the harmonization 
of the CE program requirements across the various markets will reduce 
burdens on competition by removing impediments to participation in the 
national market system and promoting competition among participants 
across the multiple national securities exchanges.

C. Self-Regulatory Organization's Statement on Comments on the Proposed 
Rule Change Received From Members, Participants, or Others

    Written comments were neither solicited nor received.

[[Page 57454]]

III. Date of Effectiveness of the Proposed Rule Change and Timing for 
Commission Action

    Because the foregoing proposed rule change does not: (i) 
significantly affect the protection of investors or the public 
interest; (ii) impose any significant burden on competition; and (iii) 
become operative for 30 days from the date on which it was filed, or 
such shorter time as the Commission may designate, it has become 
effective pursuant to Section 19(b)(3)(A) of the Act \17\ and Rule 19b-
4(f)(6) thereunder.\18\
---------------------------------------------------------------------------

    \17\ 15 U.S.C. 78s(b)(3)(A).
    \18\ 17 CFR 240.19b-4(f)(6). In addition, Rule 19b-4(f)(6) 
requires a self-regulatory organization to give the Commission 
written notice of its intent to file the proposed rule change, along 
with a brief description and text of the proposed rule change, at 
least five business days prior to the date of filing of the proposed 
rule change, or such shorter time as designated by the Commission. 
The Exchange has satisfied this requirement.
---------------------------------------------------------------------------

    A proposed rule change filed under Rule 19b-4(f)(6) \19\ normally 
does not become operative prior to 30 days after the date of the 
filing. However, pursuant to Rule 19b-4(f)(6)(iii),\20\ the Commission 
may designate a shorter time if such action is consistent with the 
protection of investors and the public interest. The Exchange has asked 
the Commission to waive the 30-day operative delay so that the proposed 
rule change may become operative upon filing. The Exchange has stated 
that a waiver of the operative delay would allow the Exchange to 
implement the proposed changes to its CE rules without delay, thereby 
eliminating the possibility of a significant regulatory gap between the 
FINRA and the Exchange rules. The Exchange has also stated that a 
waiver would provide more uniform standards across the securities 
industry and help to avoid confusion for Exchange members that are also 
FINRA members. The Exchange believes a waiver would also provide 
immediately clarity to impacted individuals, thus minimizing the 
potential for confusion regarding the time frames for satisfying 
continuing education content in order to maintain eligibility to 
participate in the continuing education program. For these reasons, the 
Commission believes that waiving the 30-day operative delay is 
consistent with the protection of investors and the public interest. 
Therefore, the Commission hereby waives the operative delay and 
designates the proposal operative upon filing.\21\
---------------------------------------------------------------------------

    \19\ 17 CFR 240.19b-4(f)(6).
    \20\ 17 CFR 240.19b-4(f)(6)(iii).
    \21\ For purposes only of waiving the 30-day operative delay, 
the Commission has considered the proposed rule's impact on 
efficiency, competition, and capital formation. See 15 U.S.C. 
78c(f).
---------------------------------------------------------------------------

    At any time within 60 days of the filing of the proposed rule 
change, the Commission summarily may temporarily suspend such rule 
change if it appears to the Commission that such action is necessary or 
appropriate in the public interest, for the protection of investors, or 
otherwise in furtherance of the purposes of the Act. If the Commission 
takes such action, the Commission shall institute proceedings under 
Section 19(b)(2)(B) \22\ of the Act to determine whether the proposed 
rule change should be approved or disapproved.
---------------------------------------------------------------------------

    \22\ 15 U.S.C. 78s(b)(2)(B).
