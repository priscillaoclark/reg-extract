I. Description of 24X's Proposed Trading System

    As described in the Notice, 24X proposes to significantly expand 
trading outside of regular trading hours \10\ for NMS stocks by 
operating a national securities exchange 23 hours a day, seven days a 
week, 365 days a year, including holidays, subject to certain trading 
pauses.\11\
---------------------------------------------------------------------------

    \10\ ``Regular trading hours'' is defined in Commission Rule 
600(b)(88) as ``the time between 9:30 a.m. and 4:00 p.m. Eastern 
Time.'' 17 CFR 242.600(b)(88).
    \11\ See proposed 24X Rule 11.1 (describing the hours of trading 
and trading days for 24X).
---------------------------------------------------------------------------

II. Amendment No. 1 to 24X's Form 1

    In Amendment No. 1, 24X proposes to revise Exhibit B-1 to: (1) 
revise proposed 24X Rule 1.5(c) (the definition of ``24X Market 
Session'') to expressly condition the operation of the 24X Market 
Session; \12\ (2) revise proposed 24X Rule 3.21 (``Customer 
Disclosures'') to provide greater specificity with regard to the 
additional risks of trading during the 24X Market Session; (3) revise 
proposed 24X Rule 11.2 (``Securities Eligible for Trading'') to 
eliminate restrictions on the classes of securities that would be 
eligible to become designated for trading on 24X during the 24X Market 
Session; \13\ (4) revise paragraph (g) of proposed 24X Rule 11.9 
(``Order Execution'') relating to the determination of the reference 
price for purposes of limit order price protection; (5) revise proposed 
24X Rule 11.14 (``Clearly Erroneous Executions'') to delete 
subparagraph (d)(4) regarding calculation of the reference price when 
the proposed 24X price band would have been in effect during the 24X 
Market Session; and (6) revise proposed 24X Rule 11.15 (``24X Market 
Session Price Bands and Trading Halts, Suspensions and Pauses'') to 
delete all references to the proposed 24X price band and to clarify its 
rules relating to trading halts made in conjunction with trading halts 
on the primary listing market.\14\
---------------------------------------------------------------------------

    \12\ Specifically, Amendment No. 1 would revise the definition 
of ``24X Market Session'' in proposed Rule 1.5(c) to read, ``(i) the 
time between 8:00 p.m. and 4:00 a.m. Eastern Time, (ii) any time 
that falls on a Saturday or a Sunday Eastern Time, (iii) any time 
that falls on one of the following U.S. holidays: New Year's Day, 
Martin Luther King Jr. Day, Presidents' Day, Good Friday, Memorial 
Day, Juneteenth National Independence Day, Independence Day, Labor 
Day, Thanksgiving Day and Christmas Day Eastern Time, or such other 
U.S. holiday(s) as published by the Exchange from time to time; 
provided, however, it shall not include any trading pauses as 
described in Rule 11.15(c). For the avoidance of doubt, 
notwithstanding anything to the contrary in these Rules, the 
Exchange shall not commence operation of the 24X Market Session 
unless (1) the equity data national market system plans have 
established a mechanism to collect, consolidate and disseminate 
quotation and transaction information during the 24X Market Session, 
or (2) the Securities and Exchange Commission has provided exemptive 
or other relief from the requirements under Rule 601, 602 and such 
plans (or their successors) applicable to the 24X Market Session.''
    \13\ In Amendment No. 1, 24X also proposes conforming changes to 
Exhibit N to reflect this revision.
    \14\ 24X also proposes a non-substantive correction to proposed 
Rule 11.21.
---------------------------------------------------------------------------

    In Amendment No. 1, 24X also proposes to revise proposed Exhibits 
C, C-2, D (including Exhibits D-1 through D-4), E, and E-1. More 
specifically, in Amendment No. 1, 24X proposes to (1) revise proposed 
Exhibit C to reflect 24X's intention to enter into a technology 
services agreement with MEMX Technologies, LLC (``MEMX Technologies'') 
to license the technology underlying 24X from MEMX Technologies; (2) 
revise proposed Exhibit C-2 to update the number of authorized 
ownership units for 24X Bermuda Holdings LLC, the ultimate holding 
company for 24X; (3) revise proposed Exhibit D, including proposed 
Exhibits D-1 through D-4, to provide updated financial information on 
24X's affiliates; and (4) revise proposed Exhibit E and E-1 to describe 
24X's proposed compliance with Regulation Systems Compliance and 
Integrity, its arrangement with MEMX Technologies, and make other 
conforming changes to reflect Amendment No. 1.
