Public Input for the Study Regarding the Implementation of the 
Prohibitions on Proprietary Trading and Certain Relationships With 
Hedge Funds and Private Equity Funds

AGENCY: Financial Stability Oversight Council.

ACTION: Notice and request for information.

-----------------------------------------------------------------------

SUMMARY: The Dodd-Frank Wall Street Reform and Consumer Protection Act 
(the ``Dodd-Frank Act'') prohibits banking entities from engaging in 
proprietary trading and from maintaining certain relationships with 
hedge funds and private equity funds. These prohibitions, commonly 
known as the ``Volcker Rule,'' are contained in Section 619 of the 
Dodd-Frank Act. Section 619 of the Dodd-Frank Act requires the 
Financial Stability Oversight Council (``FSOC'') to study and make 
recommendations on implementing the Volcker Rule. Under Section 619, 
the Office of the Comptroller of the Currency (``OCC''), the Federal 
Deposit Insurance Corporation (``FDIC''), the Board of Governors of the 
Federal Reserve System (``Board''), the Securities and Exchange 
Commission (``SEC'') and the Commodity Futures Trading Commission 
(``CFTC'') must consider the recommendations of the FSOC study in 
developing and adopting regulations to implement the Volcker Rule. To 
assist the FSOC in conducting the study and formulating its 
recommendations, the FSOC is issuing this request for information 
through public comment.

SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION:

I. Background

    The Dodd-Frank Act was enacted on July 21, 2010.\1\ Under section 
619 of the Dodd-Frank Act, banking entities \2\ are prohibited from 
engaging in proprietary trading and from maintaining certain 
relationships with hedge funds and private equity funds. These 
prohibitions and other provisions of section 619 are commonly known, 
and referred to herein, as the ``Volcker Rule.'' Section 619 of the 
Dodd-Frank Act requires the FSOC to study and make recommendations on 
implementing the Volcker Rule. Under Section 619, the OCC, the Board, 
the FDIC, the SEC and the CFTC must consider the findings of the FSOC 
study in developing and adopting regulations to carry out the Volcker 
Rule.
---------------------------------------------------------------------------

    \1\ Dodd-Frank Wall Street Reform and Consumer Protection Act, 
Public Law No. 111-203, 124 Stat. 1376 (2010).
    \2\ The term ``banking entity'' is defined in section 13(h)(1) 
of the Bank Holding Company Act, as amended by section 619 of the 
Dodd-Frank Act. The term generally means any insured depository 
institution, any company that controls an insured depository 
institution, any company that is treated as a bank holding company 
for the purposes of section 8 of the International Banking Act of 
1978, and any affiliate or subsidiary of any such entity.
---------------------------------------------------------------------------

    Section 619(b) provides certain specific guidance with respect to 
the FSOC study and recommendations, stating as follows:

    ``(1) STUDY.--Not later than 6 months after the date of 
enactment of this section, the Financial Stability Oversight Council 
shall study and make recommendations on implementing the provisions 
of this section so as to--
    ``(A) promote and enhance the safety and soundness of banking 
entities;
    ``(B) protect taxpayers and consumers and enhance financial 
stability by minimizing the risk that insured depository 
institutions and the affiliates of insured depository institutions 
will engage in unsafe and unsound activities;
    ``(C) limit the inappropriate transfer of Federal subsidies from 
institutions that benefit from deposit insurance and liquidity 
facilities of the Federal Government to unregulated entities;
    ``(D) reduce conflicts of interest between the self-interest of 
banking entities and nonbank financial companies supervised by the 
Board, and the interests of the customers of such entities and 
companies;
    ``(E) limit activities that have caused undue risk or loss in 
banking entities and nonbank financial companies supervised by the 
Board, or that might reasonably be expected to create undue risk or 
loss in such banking entities and nonbank financial companies 
supervised by the Board;
    ``(F) appropriately accommodate the business of insurance within 
an insurance company, subject to regulation in accordance with the 
relevant insurance company investment laws, while protecting the 
safety and soundness of any banking entity with which such insurance 
company is affiliated and of the United States financial system; and
    ``(G) appropriately time the divestiture of illiquid assets that 
are affected by the implementation of the prohibitions under 
subsection (a).''

II. Solicitation for Comments on the Volcker Rule Study

    To assist the FSOC in conducting the study and formulating its 
recommendations concerning the Volcker Rule, the FSOC seeks public

implementation of the Volcker Rule can best serve to:
    (i) Promote and enhance the safety and soundness of banking

stability by minimizing the risk that insured depository institutions 
and the affiliates of insured depository institutions will engage in 
unsafe and unsound activities;

institutions that benefit from deposit insurance and liquidity 
facilities of the federal government to unregulated entities;
    (iv) Reduce conflicts of interest between the self-interest of 
banking entities and nonbank financial companies supervised by the 
Board,\3\ and the interests of the customers of such entities and 
companies;
---------------------------------------------------------------------------

Board'' refers to those nonbank financial companies that may be 
designated by the FSOC under section 113 of the Act to be supervised 
by the Board and subject to enhanced prudential standards.
---------------------------------------------------------------------------

    (v) Limit activities that have caused undue risk or loss in banking 
entities and nonbank financial companies supervised by the Board, or 
that might reasonably be expected to create undue risk or loss in such 
banking entities and nonbank financial companies supervised by the 
Board;
    (vi) Appropriately accommodate the business of insurance within an 
insurance company, subject to regulation in accordance with the 
relevant insurance company investment laws, while protecting the safety 
and soundness of any banking entity with which such insurance company
