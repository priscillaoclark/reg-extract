SECURITIES AND EXCHANGE COMMISSION

[SEC File No. 270-034, OMB Control No. 3235-0034]


Submission for OMB Review; Comment Request; Extension: Rule 17f-
2(a)

Upon Written Request, Copies Available From: Securities and Exchange 
Commission, Office of FOIA Services, 100 F Street NE, Washington, DC 
20549-2736.

    Notice is hereby given that pursuant to the Paperwork Reduction Act 
of 1995 (44 U.S.C. 3501 et seq.) (``PRA''), the Securities and Exchange 
Commission (``Commission'') has submitted to the Office of Management 
and Budget (``OMB'') a request for approval of extension of the 
previously approved collection of information provided for in Rule 17f-
2(a) (17 CFR 240.17f-2(a)), under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 
(15 U.S.C. 78a et seq.).
    Rule 17f-2(a) (Fingerprinting Requirements for Securities 
Professionals) requires that securities professionals be fingerprinted. 
This requirement serves to identify security- risk personnel, to allow 
an employer to make fully informed employment decisions, and to deter 
possible wrongdoers from seeking employment in the securities industry. 
Partners, directors, officers, and employees of exchanges, brokers, 
dealers, transfer agents, and clearing agencies are included.
    The Commission staff estimates that approximately 4,480 respondents 
will submit an aggregate total of 289,780 new fingerprint cards each 
year or approximately 65 fingerprint cards per year per registrant. The 
staff estimates that the average number of hours necessary to complete 
a fingerprint card is one-half hour. Thus, the total estimated annual 
burden is 144,890 hours for all respondents (289,780 times one-half 
hour). The average internal cost of compliance per hour is 
approximately $310. Therefore, the total estimated annual internal cost 
of compliance for all respondents is $44,915,900 (144,890 times $310).
    This rule does not involve the collection of confidential 
information.
    An agency may not conduct or sponsor, and a person is not required 
to respond to, a collection of information under the PRA unless it 
displays a currently valid OMB control number.
    The public may view background documentation for this information 
collection at the following website: <a href="http://www.reginfo.gov">www.reginfo.gov</a>. Find this 
particular information collection by selecting ``Currently under 30-day 
Review--Open for Public Comments'' or by using the search function.

collection should be sent within 30 days of publication of this notice
