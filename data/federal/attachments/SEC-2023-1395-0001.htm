I. Self-Regulatory Organization's Statement of the Terms of Substance 
of the Proposed Rule Change

    The Exchange proposes to adopt new Interpretations and Policies .12 
to Rule 404, Series of Option Contracts Open for Trading, to adopt a 
new strike interval program.
    The text of the proposed rule change is available on the Exchange's 
website at <a href="https://www.miaxglobal.com/markets/us-options/pearl-options/rule-filings">https://www.miaxglobal.com/markets/us-options/pearl-options/rule-filings</a>, at MIAX Pearl's principal office, and at the Commission's 
Public Reference Room.

II. Self-Regulatory Organization's Statement of the Purpose of, and 
Statutory Basis for, the Proposed Rule Change

    In its filing with the Commission, the Exchange included statements 
concerning the purpose of and basis for the proposed rule change and 
discussed any comments it received on the proposed rule change. The 
text of these statements may be examined at the places specified in 
Item IV below. The Exchange has prepared summaries, set forth in 
sections A, B, and C below, of the most significant aspects of such 
statements.

A. Self-Regulatory Organization's Statement of the Purpose of, and 
Statutory Basis for, the Proposed Rule Change

1. Purpose
    The Exchange proposes to amend Rule 404, Series of Option Contracts 
Open for Trading. Specifically, the Exchange proposes to adopt new 
Interpretations and Policies .12 to Rule 404 to implement a new strike 
interval program for stocks that are priced less than $2.50 and have an 
average daily trading volume of at least 1,000,000 shares per day for 
the three (3) preceding calendar months. The Exchange also proposes to 
amend the table in Interpretations and Policies .11 of Rule 404 to 
harmonize the table to the propose change.
Background
    Currently, Exchange Rule 404, Series of Option Contracts Open for 
Trading, describes the process and procedures for listing and trading 
series of options \3\ on the Exchange. Rule 404 provides for a $2.50 
Strike Price Program, where the Exchange may select up to 60 option 
classes \4\ on individual stocks for which the interval of strike 
prices will be $2.50 where the strike price is greater than $25.00 but 
less than $50.00.\5\ Rule 404 also provides for a $1 Strike Price 
Interval Program, where the interval between strike prices of series of 
options \6\ on individual stocks may be $1.00 or greater provided the 
strike price is $50.00 or less, but not less than $1.00.\7\ 
Additionally, Rule 404 provides for a $0.50 Strike Program.\8\ The 
interval of strike prices of series of options on individual stocks may 
be $0.50 or greater beginning at $0.50 where the strike price is $5.50 
or less, but only for options classes whose underlying security closed 
at or below $5.00 in its primary market on the previous trading day and 
which have national average daily volume that equals or exceeds 1,000 
contracts per day as determined by The Options Clearing Corporation 
during the preceding three calendar months. The listing of $0.50 strike 
prices is limited to options classes overlying no more than 20 
individual stocks (the ``$0.50 Strike Program'') as specifically 
designated by the Exchange. The Exchange may list $0.50 strike prices 
on any other option classes if those classes are specifically 
designated by other securities exchanges that employ a similar $0.50 
Strike Program under their respective rules. A stock shall remain in 
the $0.50 Strike Program until otherwise designated by the Exchange.\9\
---------------------------------------------------------------------------

    \3\ The term ``option contract'' means a put or a call issued, 
or subject to issuance, by the Clearing Corporation pursuant to the 
Rules of the Clearing Corporation. See Exchange Rule 100.
    \4\ The terms ``class of options'' or ``option class'' means all 
option contracts covering the same underlying security. See Exchange 
Rule 100.
    \5\ See Exchange Rule 404(f).
    \6\ The term ``series of options'' means all option contracts of 
the same class having the same exercise price and expiration date. 
See Exchange Rule 100.

---------------------------------------------------------------------------

Proposal
    At this time, the Exchange proposes to adopt a new strike interval 
program for underlying stocks that are not in the aforementioned $0.50 
Strike Program (or the Short Term Option Series Program) \10\ and that 
close below $2.50 and have an average daily trading volume of at least 
1,000,000 shares per day for the three (3) preceding calendar months. 
The $0.50 Strike Program considers stocks that have a closing price at 
or below $5.00 whereas the Exchange's proposal will consider stocks 
that have a closing price below $2.50. Currently, there is a subset of 
stocks that are not included in the $0.50 Strike Program as a result of 
the

[[Page 84380]]

limitations of that program which provides that the listing of $0.50 
strike prices shall be limited to option classes overlying no more than 
20 individual stocks as specifically designated by the Exchange and 
requires a national average daily volume that equals or exceeds 1,000 
contracts per day as determined by The Options Clearing Corporation 
during the preceding three calendar months.\11\ Therefore, the Exchange 
is proposing to implement a new strike interval program termed the 
``Low Priced Stock Strike Price Interval Program.'' The Exchange notes 
that this proposal is substantively identical to a proposal recently 
approved on the Exchange's affiliate, MIAX Options Exchange.\12\
---------------------------------------------------------------------------

    \10\ See Interpretations and Policies .02 of Rule 404.
    \11\ See Interpretations and Policies .04 of Rule 404.
    \12\ See Securities Exchange Release Act No. 98917 (November 13, 
2023), 88 FR 80361 (November 17, 2023) (SR-MIAX-2023-36) (Order 
Approving a Proposed Rule Change to Amend Exchange Rule 404, Series 
of Option Contracts Open for Trading).
---------------------------------------------------------------------------

    To be eligible for the inclusion in the Low Priced Stock Strike 
Price Interval Program, an underlying stock must (i) close below $2.50 
in its primary market on the previous trading day; and (ii) have an 
average daily trading volume of at least 1,000,000 shares per day for 
the three (3) preceding calendar months. The Exchange notes that there 
is no limit to the number of classes that will be eligible for 
inclusion in the proposed program, provided, of course, that the 
underlying stocks satisfy both the price and average daily trading 
volume requirements of the proposed program.
    The Exchange also proposes that after a stock is added to the Low 
Priced Stock Strike Price Interval Program, the Exchange may list $0.50 
strike price intervals from $0.50 up to $2.00.\13\ For the purpose of 
adding strikes under the Low Priced Stock Strike Price Interval 
Program, the ``price of the underlying stock'' shall be measured in the 
same way as ``the price of the underlying security'' as set forth in 
Rule 404A(b)(1).\14\ Further, no additional series in $0.50 intervals 
may be listed if the underlying stock closes at or above $2.50 in its 
primary market. Additional series in $0.50 intervals may not be added 
until the underlying stock again closes below $2.50.
---------------------------------------------------------------------------

    \13\ While the Exchange may list new strikes on underlying 
stocks that meet the eligibility requirements of the new program the 
Exchange will exercise its discretion and will not list strikes on 
underlying stocks the Exchange believes are subject to imminent 
delisting from their primary exchange.
    \14\ The Exchange notes this is the same methodology used in the 
$1 Strike Price Interval Program. See Interpretations and Policies 
.01(c)(3) of Rule 404.
---------------------------------------------------------------------------

    The Exchange's proposal addresses a gap in strike coverage for low 
priced stocks. The $0.50 Strike Program considers stocks that close 
below $5.00 and limits the number of option classes listed to no more 
than 20 individual stocks (provided that the open interest criteria is 
also satisfied). Whereas, the Exchange's proposal has a narrower focus, 
with respect to the underlying's stock price, and is targeted to those 
stocks that close below $2.50 and does not limit the number of stocks 
that may participate in the program (provided that the average daily 
trading volume is also satisfied). The Exchange does not believe that 
any market disruptions will be encountered with the addition of these 
new strikes. The Exchange represents that it has the necessary capacity 
and surveillance programs in place to support and properly monitor 
trading in the proposed Low Priced Stock Strike Price Interval Program.
    The Exchange believes that its average daily trading volume 
requirement of 1,000,000 shares is a reasonable threshold to ensure 
adequate liquidity in eligible underlying stocks as it is substantially 
greater than the thresholds used for listing options on equities, 
American Depository Receipts, and broad-based indexes. Specifically, 
underlying securities with respect to which put or call option 
contracts are approved for listing and trading on the Exchange must 
meet certain criteria as determined by the Exchange. One of those 
requirements is that trading volume (in all markets in which the 
underlying security is traded) has been at least 2,400,000 shares in 
the preceding twelve (12) months.\15\ Rule 402(f) provides the criteria 
for listing options on American Depositary Receipts (``ADRs'') if they 
meet certain criteria and guidelines set forth in Exchange Rule 402. 
One of the requirements is that the average daily trading volume for 
the security in the U.S. markets over the three (3) months preceding 
the selection of the ADR for options trading is 100,000 or more 
shares.\16\ Finally, the Exchange may trade options on a broad-based 
index pursuant to Rule 19b-4(e) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 
provided a number of conditions are satisfied. One of those conditions 
is that each component security that accounts for at least one percent 
(1%) of the weight of the index has an average daily trading volume of 
at least 90,000 shares during the last six month period.\17\
---------------------------------------------------------------------------

    \15\ See Exchange Rule 402(b)(4).
    \16\ See Exchange Rule 402(f)(3)(ii).
    \17\ See Exchange Rule 1802(d)(7).
---------------------------------------------------------------------------

    Additionally, the Exchange proposes to amend the table in 
Interpretations and Policies .11 of Rule 404 to insert a new column to 
harmonize the Exchange's proposal to the strike intervals for Short 
Term Options Series as described in Interpretations and Policies .02 of 
Rule 404. The table in Interpretations and Policies .11 is intended to 
limit the intervals between strikes for multiply listed equity options 
within the Short Term Options Series program that have an expiration 
date more than twenty-one days from the listing date. Specifically, the 
table defines the applicable strike intervals for options on underlying 
stocks given the closing price on the primary market on the last day of 
the calendar quarter, and a corresponding average daily volume of the 
total number of options contracts traded in a given security for the 
applicable calendar quarter divided by the number of trading days in 
the applicable calendar quarter.\18\ However, the lowest share price 
column is titled ``Less than $25.'' The Exchange now proposes to insert 
a column titled ``Less than $2.50'' and to set the strike interval at 
$0.50 for each average daily volume tier represented in the table. 
Also, the Exchange proposes to amend the heading of the column 
currently titled ``Less than $25,'' to ``$2.50 to less than $25'' as a 
result of the adoption of the new proposed column, ``Less than $2.50.'' 
The Exchange believes this change will remove any potential conflict 
between the strike intervals under the Short Term Options Series 
Program and those described herein under the Exchange's proposal.
---------------------------------------------------------------------------

2021), 86 FR 10375 (February 19, 2021) (SR-BX-2020-032) (Order 
Granting Accelerated Approval of a Proposed Rule Change, as Modified 
by Amendment No. 1, To Amend Options 4, Section 5, To Limit Short 
Term Options Series Intervals Between Strikes That Are Available for 
Quoting and Trading on BX).
---------------------------------------------------------------------------

Impact of Proposal
    The Exchange recognizes that its proposal will introduce new 
strikes in the marketplace and further acknowledges that there has been 
significant effort undertaken by the industry to curb strike 
proliferation. This initiative has been spearheaded by the Nasdaq BX 
who filed an initial proposal focused on the removal, and prevention of 
the listing, of strikes which are extraneous and do not add value to 
the marketplace (the ``Strike Interval Proposal'').\19\ The Strike 
Interval Proposal was intended to remove repetitive and unnecessary

[[Page 84381]]

strike listings across the weekly expiries. Specifically, the Strike 
Interval Proposal aimed to reduce the density of strike intervals that 
would be listed in the later weeks, by creating limitations for 
intervals between strikes which have an expiration date more than 
twenty-one days from the listing date.\20\ The Strike Interval Proposal 
took into account OCC customer-cleared volume, using it as an 
appropriate proxy for demand. The Strike Interval Proposal was designed 
to maintain strikes where there was customer demand and eliminate 
strikes where there wasn't. At the time of its proposal Nasdaq BX 
estimated that the Strike Interval Proposal would reduce the number of 
strikes it listed by 81,000.\21\ The Exchange proposes to amend the 
table to define the strike interval at $0.50 for underlying stocks with 
a share price of less than $2.50. The Exchange believes this amendment 
will harmonize the Exchange's proposal with the Strike Interval 
Proposal described above.
---------------------------------------------------------------------------

    \19\ See Securities Exchange Act No. 91225 (February 12, 2021), 
86 FR 10375 (February 12, 2021) (SR-BX-2020-032) (BX Strike Approval 
Order); see also BX Options Strike Proliferation Proposal (February 
25, 2021) available at: <a href="https://www.nasdaq.com/solutions/bx-options-strike-proliferation-proposal">https://www.nasdaq.com/solutions/bx-options-strike-proliferation-proposal</a>).
    \20\ See Securities Exchange Act No. 91225 (February 12, 2021), 
86 FR 10375 (February 12, 2021) (SR-BX-2020-032).
    \21\ See id.
---------------------------------------------------------------------------

    The Exchange recognizes that its proposal will moderately increase 
the total number of option series available on the Exchange. However, 
the Exchange's proposal is designed to only add strikes where there is 
investor demand \22\ which will improve market quality. Under the 
requirements for the Low Priced Stock Strike Price Interval Program as 
described herein, the Exchange determined that as of August 9, 2023, 
106 symbols met the proposed criteria. Of those symbols 36 are 
currently in the $1 Strike Price Interval Program with $1.00 and $2.00 
strikes listed. Under the Exchange's proposal the Exchange would add 
the $0.50 and $1.50 strikes for these symbols for the current 
expiration terms. The remaining 70 symbols eligible under the 
Exchange's proposal would have $0.50, $1.00, $1.50 and $2.00 strikes 
added to their current expiration terms. Therefore, for the 106 symbols 
eligible for the Low Priced Stock Strike Price Interval Program a total 
of approximately 3,250 options would be added. As of August 9, 2023, 
the Exchange listed 1,106,550 options, therefore the additional options 
that would be listed under this proposal would represent a very minor 
increase of 0.294% in the number of options listed on the Exchange.
---------------------------------------------------------------------------

    \22\ See proposed Interpretations and Policies .12(a) of Rule 
404 which requires that an underlying stock have an average daily 
trading volume of 1,000,000 shares for the three (3) preceding 
months to be eligible for inclusion in the Low Priced Stock Strike 
Price Interval Program.
---------------------------------------------------------------------------

    The Exchange does not believe that its proposal contravenes the 
industry's efforts to curtail unnecessary strikes. The Exchange's 
proposal is targeted to only underlying stocks that close at less than 
$2.50 and that also meet the average daily trading volume requirement. 
Additionally, because the strike increment is $0.50 there are only a 
total of four strikes that may be listed under the program ($0.50, 
$1.00, $1.50, and $2.00) for an eligible underlying stock. Finally, if 
an eligible underlying stock is in another program (e.g., the $0.50 
Strike Program or the $1 Strike Price Interval Program) the number of 
strikes that may be added is further reduced if there are pre-existing 
strikes as part of another strike listing program. Therefore, the 
Exchange does not believe that it will list any unnecessary or 
repetitive strikes as part of its program, and that the strikes that 
will be listed will improve market quality and satisfy investor demand.
    The Exchange further believes that the Options Price Reporting 
Authority (``OPRA''), has the necessary systems capacity to handle any 
additional messaging traffic associated with this proposed rule change. 
The Exchange also believes that Members \23\ will not have a capacity 
issue as a result of the proposed rule change. Finally, the Exchange 
believes that the additional options will serve to increase liquidity, 
provide additional trading and hedging opportunities for all market 
participants, and improve market quality.
---------------------------------------------------------------------------

    \23\ The term ``Member'' means an individual or organization 
that is registered with the Exchange pursuant to Chapter II of MIAX 
Pearl Rules for purposes of trading on the Exchange as an 
``Electronic Exchange Member'' or ``Market Maker.'' Members are 
deemed ``members'' under the Exchange Act. See Exchange Rule 100.
---------------------------------------------------------------------------

2. Statutory Basis
    The Exchange believes that its proposal to amend its Fee Schedule 
is consistent with section 6(b) of the Act \24\ in general, and 
furthers the objectives of section 6(b)(4) of the Act \25\ in 
particular, in that it is an equitable allocation of reasonable dues, 
fees, and other charges among its members and issuers and other persons 
using its facilities. The Exchange also believes the proposal furthers 
the objectives of section 6(b)(5) of the Act \26\ in that it is 
designed to promote just and equitable principles of trade, to remove 
impediments to and perfect the mechanism of a free and open market and 
a national market system, and, in general to protect investors and the 
public interest and is not designed to permit unfair discrimination 
between customers, issuers, brokers and dealers.

---------------------------------------------------------------------------

    The Exchange believes its proposal promotes just and equitable 
principles of trade and removes impediments to and perfects the 
mechanisms of a free and open market and a national market system as 
the Exchange has identified a subset of stocks that are trading under 
$2.50 and do not have meaningful strikes available. For example, on 
August 9, 2023, symbol SOND closed at $0.50 and had open interest of 
over 44,000 contracts and an average daily trading volume in the 
underlying stock of over 1,900,000 shares for the three preceding 
calendar months.\27\ Currently the lowest strike listed is for $2.50, 
making the lowest strike 400% away from the closing stock price. 
Another symbol, CTXR, closed at $0.92 on August 9, 2023, and had open 
interest of over 63,000 contracts and an average daily trading volume 
in the underlying stock of over 1,900,000 shares for the three 
preceding calendar months.\28\ Similarly, the lowest strike listed is 
for $2.50, making the lowest strike more than 170% away from the 
closing stock price. Currently, such products have no at-the-money 
options, as well as no in-the-money calls or out-of-the-money puts. The 
Exchange's proposal will provide additional strikes in $0.50 increments 
from $0.50 up to $2.00 to provide more meaningful trading and hedging 
opportunities for this subset of stocks. Given the increased 
granularity of strikes as proposed under the Exchange's proposal out-
of-the-money puts and in-the-money calls will be created. The Exchange 
believes this will allow market participants to tailor their investment 
and hedging needs more effectively.

---------------------------------------------------------------------------

    The Exchange believes its proposal promotes just and equitable 
principles of trade and removes impediments to and perfects the 
mechanisms of a free and open market and a national market system and, 
in general, protects investors and the public interest by adding 
strikes that improves market quality and satisfies investor demand. The 
Exchange does not believe that the number of strikes that will be added 
under the program will negatively impact the market. Additionally, the 
proposal does not run counter to the

[[Page 84382]]

efforts undertaken by the industry to curb strike proliferation as that 
effort focused on the removal and prevention of extraneous strikes 
where there was no investor demand. The Exchange's proposal requires 
the satisfaction of an average daily trading volume threshold in 
addition to the underlying stock closing at a price below $2.50 to be 
eligible for the program. The Exchange believes that the average daily 
trading volume threshold of the program ensures that only strikes with 
investor demand will be listed and fills a gap in strike interval 
coverage as described above. Further, being that the strike interval is 
$0.50, there are only a maximum of four strikes that may be added 
($0.50, $1.00, $1.50, and $2.00). Therefore, the Exchange does not 
believe that its proposal will undermine the industry's efforts to 
eliminate repetitive and unnecessary strikes in any fashion.
    The Exchange believes that its average daily trading volume 
threshold promotes just and equitable principles of trade and removes 
impediments to and perfects the mechanisms of a free and open market 
and a national market system and, in general, protects investors and 
the public interest as it is designed to permit only those stocks with 
demonstrably high levels of trading activity to participate in the 
program. The Exchange notes that its average daily trading volume 
requirement is substantially greater that the average daily trading 
requirement currently in place on the Exchange for options on equity 
underlyings,\29\ ADRs,\30\ and broad-based indexes.\31\
---------------------------------------------------------------------------

    \29\ See supra note 15.
    \30\ See supra note 16.
    \31\ See supra note 17.
---------------------------------------------------------------------------

    The Exchange believes that the proposed rule change is consistent 
with section 6(b)(1) of the Act, which provides that the Exchange be 
organized and have the capacity to be able to carry out the purposes of 
the Act and the rules and regulations thereunder, and the rules of the 
Exchange. The proposed rule change allows the Exchange to respond to 
customer demand to provide meaningful strikes for low priced stocks. 
The Exchange does not believe that the proposed rule would create any 
capacity issue or negatively affect market functionality. Additionally, 
the Exchange represents that it has the necessary systems capacity to 
support the new options series and handle additional messaging traffic 
associated with this proposed rule change. The Exchange also believes 
that its Members will not experience any capacity issues as a result of 
this proposal. In addition, the Exchange represents that it believes 
that additional strikes for low priced stocks will serve to increase 
liquidity available as well and improve price efficiency by providing 
more trading opportunities for all market participants. The Exchange 
believes that the proposed rule change will benefit investors by giving 
them increased opportunities to execute their investment and hedging 
decisions.
    Finally, the Exchange believes its proposal is designed to prevent 
fraudulent and manipulative acts and practices as options may only be 
listed on underlyings that satisfy the listing requirements of the 
Exchange as described in Exchange Rule 402, Criteria for Underlying 
Securities. Specifically, Rule 402 requires that underlying securities 
for which put or call option contracts are approved for listing and 
trading on the Exchange must meet the following criteria: (1) the 
security must be registered and be an ``NMS stock'' as defined in Rule 
600 of Regulation NMS under the Exchange Act; (2) the security shall be 
characterized by a substantial number of outstanding shares that are 
widely held and actively traded.\32\ Additionally, Rule 402 provides 
that absent exceptional circumstances, an underlying security will not 
be selected for options transactions unless: (1) there are a minimum of 
seven (7) million shares of the underlying security which are owned by 
persons other than those required to report their stock holdings under 
section 16(a) of the Exchange Act; (2) there are a minimum of 2,000 
holders of the underlying security; (3) the issuer is in compliance 
with any applicable requirements of the Exchange Act; and (4) trading 
volume (in all markets in which the underlying security is traded) has 
been at least 2,400,000 shares in the preceding twelve (12) months.\33\ 
The Exchange's proposal does not impact the eligibility of an 
underlying stock to have options listed on it, but rather addresses 
only the listing of new additional option classes on an underlying 
listed on the Exchange in accordance to the Exchange's listings rules. 
As such, the Exchange believes that the listing requirements described 
in Exchange Rule 402 address potential concerns regarding possible 
manipulation. Additionally, in conjunction with the proposed Average 
Daily Volume requirement described herein, the Exchange believes any 
possible market manipulation is further mitigated.

B. Self-Regulatory Organization's Statement on Burden on Competition

    The Exchange does not believe that the proposed rule change will 
impose any burden on competition that is not necessary or appropriate 
in furtherance of the purposes of the Act.
    The Exchange does not believe that its proposed rule change will 
impose any burden on intra-market competition as the Rules of the 
Exchange apply equally to all Members of the Exchange and all Members 
may trade the new proposed strikes if they so choose. Specifically, the 
Exchange believes that investors and market participants will 
significantly benefit from the availability of finer strike price 
intervals for stocks priced below $2.50, which will allow them to 
tailor their investment and hedging needs more effectively.
    The Exchange does not believe that its proposed rule change will 
impose any burden on inter-market competition, as nothing prevents 
other options exchanges from proposing similar rules to list and trade 
options on low priced stocks. Rather the Exchange believes that its 
proposal will promote inter-market competition, as the Exchange's 
proposal will result in additional opportunities for investors to 
achieve their investment and trading objectives, to the benefit of 
investors, market participants, and the marketplace in general.

Rule Change Received From Members, Participants, or Others

Commission Action

    Pursuant to section 19(b)(3)(A) of the Act \34\ and Rule 19b-
4(f)(6) \35\ thereunder, the Exchange has designated this proposal as 
one that effects a change that: (i) does not significantly affect the 
protection of investors or the public interest; (ii) does not impose 
any significant burden on competition; and (iii) by its terms, does not 
become operative for 30 days after the date of the filing, or such 
shorter time as the Commission may designate if consistent with the 
protection of investors and the public interest.\36\
---------------------------------------------------------------------------

    \34\ 15 U.S.C. 78s(b)(3)(A).
    \35\ 17 CFR 240.19b-4(f)(6).
    \36\ In addition, Rule 19b-4(f)(6) requires a self-regulatory 
organization to give the Commission written notice of its intent to 
file the proposed rule change at least five business days prior to 
the date of filing of the proposed rule change, or such shorter time 
as designated by the Commission. The Exchange has satisfied this 
requirement.

    A proposed rule change filed pursuant to Rule 19b-4(f)(6) under the 
Act normally does not become operative for 30 days after the date of 
its filing. However, Rule 19b-4(f)(6)(iii) \37\ permits the Commission 
to designate a shorter time if such action is consistent with the 
protection of investors and the public interest. The Exchange requested 
that the Commission waive the 30-day operative delay so that the 
proposal may become operative immediately upon filing. The Commission 
notes it has approved a proposed rule change substantially identical to 
the one proposed by the Exchange.\38\ The proposed change raises no 
novel legal or regulatory issues. Therefore, the Commission believes 
that waiver of the 30-day operative delay is consistent with the 
protection of investors and the public interest. Accordingly, the 
Commission hereby waives the 30-day operative delay and designates the 
proposed rule change operative upon filing.\39\

    \37\ 17 CFR 240.19b-4(f)(6)(iii).
    \38\ See supra note 3.
    \39\ For purposes only of waiving the 30-day operative delay, 
the Commission has also considered the proposed rule's impact on 
efficiency, competition, and capital formation. See 15 U.S.C. 
78c(f).
---------------------------------------------------------------------------

    At any time within 60 days of the filing of the proposed rule 
change, the Commission summarily may temporarily suspend such rule 
change if it appears to the Commission that such action is necessary or 
appropriate in the public interest, for the protection of investors, or 
otherwise in furtherance of the purposes of the Act. If the Commission 
takes such action, the Commission shall institute proceedings to 
determine whether the proposed rule should be approved or disapproved.
