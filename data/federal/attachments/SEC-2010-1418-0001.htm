A. Self-Regulatory Organization's Statement of the Purpose of, and the 
Statutory Basis for, the Proposed Rule Change

1. Purpose
    On August 23, 2010, the Commission published an immediately 
effective rule filing to modify the transaction fees for 24 securities 
currently traded on CBSX (the following symbols: BAC, C, DXD, EMC, EWJ, 
F, FAX, FAZ, GE, INTC, MOT, MSFT, MU, NOK, Q, QID, S, SIRI, SKF, T, 
TWM, UNG, UWM, XLF).\4\ The Exchange now proposes to add 51 securities 
to that list of securities (the following symbols: AA, AMAT, AMD, BGZ, 
BP, BSX, CMCSA, COCO, CSCO, CX, DELL, DUK, EBAY, EEM, EWT, FAS, FLEX, 
HBAN, IYR, MDT, MGM, NLY, NVDA, NWSA, ORCL, PFE, QCOM, QQQQ, SBUX, SH, 
SLV, SMH, SSO, SYMC, TBT, TSM, TXN, UCO, USO, VALE, VWO, WFC, XHB, XLB, 
XLK, XLP, XLU, XLV, XLY, XRX, YHOO). For those securities already 
approved for the new transaction fees as well as those that would be 
added by this proposed rule change, assuming their prices do not drop 
below $1, the takers of liquidity will receive a $0.0014 per share 
rebate, and makers of liquidity will incur a $0.0018 charge. The new 
pricing strategy is designed to incent order routing behavior that 
selects CBSX as the first destination. The changes will take effect on 
September 1, 2010.
---------------------------------------------------------------------------

    \4\ See Securities Exchange Act Release No. 34-62758 (August 23, 
2010), 75 FR 52792 [sic] (August 27, 2010) (SR-CBOE-2010-075).
---------------------------------------------------------------------------

2. Statutory Basis
    The proposed rule change is consistent with Section 6(b) of the 
Securities Exchange Act of 1934 (``Act''),\5\ in general, and furthers 
the objectives of Section 6(b)(4) \6\ of the Act in particular, in that 
it is designed to provide for the equitable allocation of reasonable 
dues, fees, and other charges among CBOE members and other persons 
using its facilities.

    \6\ 15 U.S.C. 78f(b)(4).
---------------------------------------------------------------------------

B. Self-Regulatory Organization's Statement on Burden on Competition

    CBOE does not believe that the proposed rule change will impose any 
burden on competition not necessary or appropriate in furtherance of 
the purposes of the Act.

C. Self-Regulatory Organization's Statement on Comments on the Proposed 
Rule Change Received From Members, Participants, or Others

    No written comments were solicited or received with respect to the 
proposed rule change.

III. Date of Effectiveness of the Proposed Rule Change and Timing for 
Commission Action

    The foregoing rule change has become effective pursuant to Section 
19(b)(3)(A) of the Act and paragraph (f) of Rule 19b-4 thereunder. At 
any time within 60 days of the filing of the proposed rule change, the 
Commission summarily may temporarily suspend such rule change if it 
appears to the Commission that such action is necessary or appropriate 
in the public interest, for the protection of investors, or otherwise 
in furtherance of the purposes of the Act.
