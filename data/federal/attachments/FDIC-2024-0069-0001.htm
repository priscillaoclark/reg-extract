    General Description of Collection: The collection of information 
requirements is contained in 12 CFR part 344. The purpose of the 
regulation is to ensure that purchasers of securities in transactions 
affected by insured state nonmember banks are provided with adequate 
records concerning the transactions. The regulation is also designed to 
ensure that insured State nonmember banks maintain adequate records and 
controls with respect to the securities transactions they effect. 
Finally, this regulation requires officers and employees of FDIC-
supervised institutions to report to the FDIC-supervised institution 
certain personal securities trading activity. There is no change in the 
methodology or substance of this information collection. The decrease 
in total estimated annual burden from 8,583 hours in 2021 to 8,216 
hours currently is due to a decrease in estimated number of 
respondents.
    2. Title: Notice of Branch Closure.
    OMB Number: 3064-0109.
    Form Number: None.
    Affected Public: FDIC-insured depository institutions.

    General Description of Collection: Section 42 of the Federal 
Deposit Insurance Act mandates that an insured depository institution 
closing a branch notify its primary federal regulator not later than 90 
days prior to the closing. The statute also provides that a notice be 
posted on the premises of the branch for the 30-day period immediately 
prior to the closing and that the customers be notified in a mailing at 
least 90 days prior to the closing. Each insured depository institution 
that has one or more branches is required to adopt a written policy for 
branch closings. There is no change in the methodology or substance of 
this information collection. The increase in total estimated annual 
burden from 1,738 hours in 2021 to 1,795 hours currently is due to an 
increase in estimated number or respondents.

    General Description of Collection: This information collection 
consists of two parts: (1) a certification that insured depository 
institutions provide the FDIC when all deposit liabilities from one 
insured depository institution are assumed from another insured 
depository institution, with the latter institution responsible for 
providing the certification; and (2) a notification that an insured 
depository institution provides to its depositors when it seeks to 
voluntarily terminate its insured status. The certification is 
necessary to implement the provisions of section 8(q) of the Federal 
Deposit Insurance Act, 12 U.S.C. 1818(q), regarding termination of the 
insured status of the transferring institution and termination of the 
separate deposit insurance coverage provided on deposit accounts 
assumed by the assuming institution. The depositor notification is 
required by section 8(a)(6) of the Federal Deposit Insurance Act, 12 
U.S.C. 1818(a)(6). This provision ensures that the institution's 
depositors receive appropriate information regarding the institution's 
intent to terminate its insured status and that, prior to the 
termination of the institution's insured status, depositors receive 
appropriate information concerning federal deposit insurance coverage 
of their accounts once the institution's insured status is terminated. 
There is no change in the methodology or substance of this information 
collection. The decrease in total estimated annual burden from 256 in 
2021 to 186 currently is due to a change in the estimated number or 
respondents.
    4. Title: Extension without change of a currently approved 
collection.
    OMB Number: 3064-0134.
    Form Number: 6422/04; 6422/11; 6422/15.

Institutions.

    General Description of Collection: This collection facilitates the 
collection of information from customers of financial institutions that 
have inquiries or complaints about service. Customers or businesses may 
document their complaints or inquiries to the FDIC using a letter or 
optional forms (Form 6422/04; Form 6422/11; Form 6422/15). The forms 
are used to facilitate online completion and submission of the 
complaints or inquiries and to shorten FDIC response times by making it 
easier to identify the nature of the complaint and to route the 
customer or business inquiry to the appropriate FDIC contact. There is 
no change in the methodology or substance of this information 
collection. The increase in total estimated annual burden from 1,468 in 
2021 to 2,806 currently is due to an increase in the estimated number 
or respondents.

Request for Comment

    Comments are invited on: (a) Whether the collections of information 
are necessary for the proper performance of the FDIC's functions, 
including whether the information has practical utility; (b) the 
accuracy of the estimates of the burden of the information collections, 
including the validity of the methodology and assumptions used; (c) 
ways to enhance the quality, utility, and clarity of the information to 
be collected; and (d) ways to minimize the burden of the collections of 
information on respondents, including through the use of automated 
collection techniques or other forms of information technology. All 
comments will become a matter of public record.
