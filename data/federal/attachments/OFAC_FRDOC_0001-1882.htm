Office of Foreign Assets Control


Publication of the List of Services, Software, and Hardware 
Incident to Communications

AGENCY: Office of Foreign Assets Control, Treasury.

ACTION: Publication of a list of items determined to be incident to 
communications in the Iranian Transactions and Sanctions Regulations.

-----------------------------------------------------------------------

SUMMARY: The Department of the Treasury's Office of Foreign Assets 
Control (OFAC) is publishing a list of items that have been determined 
to be incident to communications and therefore authorized for export or 
reexport to Iran under a general license issued pursuant to the Iranian 
Transactions and Sanctions Regulations (ITSR). The list previously 
existed as an annex to ITSR General License D and its subsequent 
iterations, General License D-1 and General License D-2, all of which 
were previously made available on OFAC's website. Concurrent with 
publication of the list, OFAC is publishing an updated version of the 
list that, effective 30 days after publication, will restrict the 
computing power of certain items on the list.

DATES: This list is effective May 17, 2024.

FOR FURTHER INFORMATION CONTACT: OFAC: Assistant Director for 
Licensing, 202-622-2480; Assistant Director for Regulatory Affairs, 
202-622-4855; or Assistant Director for Sanctions Compliance & 
Evaluation, 202-622-2490.

SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION:

Electronic Availability

    The text of the List of Services, Software, and Hardware Incident 
to Communications is available on the Iran Sanctions page on OFAC's 
website, and additional information concerning OFAC is available on 
OFAC's website (<a href="http://www.treasury.gov/ofac">www.treasury.gov/ofac</a>).

Background

    On May 30, 2013, OFAC, in consultation with the Departments of 
State and Commerce, issued General License (GL) D under the 
Regulations. GL D was made available on OFAC's website and in the 
Federal Register (78 FR 43278, July 19, 2013). GL D authorized the 
exportation or reexportation, directly or indirectly, from the United 
States or by U.S. persons, wherever located, to persons in Iran of 
additional services, software, and hardware incident to personal 
communications, including fee-based versions of the software and 
services authorized in Sec.  560.540. GL D also contained an Annex that 
listed items authorized for export or reexport that had been determined 
to be incident to personal communications.
    On February 7, 2014, OFAC issued GL D-1, which replaced and 
superseded GL D in its entirety. GL D-1 was made available on OFAC's 
website and in the Federal Register (79 FR 13736, March 11, 2014). GL 
D-1 clarified certain aspects of GL D and added certain new

[[Page 43513]]

authorizations relating to the provision to Iran and importation from 
Iran of certain hardware, software, and services incident to personal 
communications. GL D-1 made minor amendments to the Annex from GL D. On 
September 23, 2022, OFAC issued GL D-2, which replaced and superseded 
GL D-1 in its entirety. GL D-2 was made available on OFAC's website and 
in the Federal Register (87 FR 62003, October 13, 2022), and updated 
and clarified GL D-1 by, among other things: removing the ``personal'' 
qualifier from the authorization for software and services incident to 
``personal communication'' and providing additional examples of certain 
modern types of software and services that are incident to the exchange 
of communications.
    OFAC is now publishing the list of items previously included in the 
annexes to GL D, GL D-1, and GL D-2 as the 31 CFR 560.540 List of 
Services, Software, and Hardware Incident to Communications (the 
``List''). The text of the List is provided below. Concurrently, OFAC 
is publishing an updated version of the List that will restrict the 
computing power of laptops, tablets, and personal computing devices 
authorized for exportation or reexportation to Iran under category (5) 
of the List, effective 30 days after publication in the Federal 
Register.
