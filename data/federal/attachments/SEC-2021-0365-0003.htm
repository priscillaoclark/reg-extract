SECURITIES AND EXCHANGE COMMISSION

[SEC File No. 270-222, OMB Control No. 3235-0233]


Submission for OMB Review; Comment Request; Extension: Form 2-E

Upon Written Request, Copies Available From: Securities and Exchange 
Commission, Office of FOIA Services, 100 F Street NE, Washington, DC 
20549-2736

    Notice is hereby given that, pursuant to the Paperwork Reduction 
Act of 1995 (44 U.S.C. 3501 et seq.), the Securities and Exchange 
Commission (the ``Commission'') has submitted to the Office of 
Management and Budget (``OMB'') a request for extension of the 
previously approved collection of information discussed below.
    Rule 609 (17 CFR 230.609) under the Securities Act of 1933 (15 
U.S.C. 77a et seq.) requires small business investment companies and 
business development companies that have engaged in offerings of 
securities that are exempt from registration pursuant to Regulation E 
under the Securities Act of 1933 (17 CFR 230.601 to 610a) to report 
semi-annually on Form 2-E (17 CFR 239.201) the progress of the 
offering. The form solicits information such as the dates an offering 
commenced and was completed (if completed), the number of shares sold 
and still being offered, amounts received in the offering, and expenses 
and underwriting discounts incurred in the offering. The information 
provided on Form 2-E assists the staff in monitoring the progress of 
the offering and in determining whether the offering has stayed within 
the limits set for an offering exempt under Regulation E.
    Although there have been no filings of Form 2-E since 2017, for 
administrative purposes the Commission estimates that, on average, 
approximately one respondent submits a Form 2-E filing each year. The 
Commission further estimates that this information collection imposes 
an annual burden of four hours and imposes no annual external cost 
burden.
    The collection of information under Form 2-E is mandatory. The 
information provided by the form will not be kept confidential. An 
agency may not conduct or sponsor, and a person is not required to 
respond to, a collection of information unless it displays a currently 
valid OMB control number.
    Written comments continue to be invited on: (a) whether this 
collection of information is necessary for the proper performance of 
the functions of the agency, including whether the information will 
have practical utility; (b) the accuracy of the agency's estimate of 
the burden imposed by the collection of information; (c) ways to 
enhance the quality, utility, and clarity of the information collected; 
and (d) ways to minimize the burden of the collection of information on 
respondents, including through the use of automated collection 
techniques or other forms of information technology.
    An agency may not conduct or sponsor, and a person is not required 
to respond to, a collection of information under the PRA unless it 
displays a currently valid OMB control number.
    The public may view background documentation for this information 
collection at the following website: <a href="http://www.reginfo.gov">www.reginfo.gov</a>. Find this 
particular information collection by selecting ``Currently under 30-day 
Review--Open for Public Comments'' or by using the search function.

collection should be sent within 30 days of publication of this notice 
by January 22, 2024 to (i) <a href="/cdn-cgi/l/email-protection#a0ede2f88eefede28eefe9f2e18ef3e5e3ffc4c5d3cbffcfc6c6c9c3c5d2e0cfcdc28ec5cfd08ec7cfd6"><span class="__cf_email__" data-cfemail="e6aba4bec8a9aba4c8a9afb4a7c8b5a3a5b98283958db98980808f858394a6898b84c8838996c8818990">[email&#160;protected]</span></a>
