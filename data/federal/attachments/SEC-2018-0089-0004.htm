SECURITIES AND EXCHANGE COMMISSION

[SEC File No. 270-104, OMB Control No. 3235-0119]


Proposed Collection; Comment Request; Extension: Securities 
Exchange Act 1934--Rule 12g3-2

Upon Written Request Copies Available From: Securities and Exchange 
Commission, Office of FOIA Services, 100 F Street NE, Washington, DC 
20549-2736

    Notice is hereby given that, pursuant to the Paperwork Reduction 
Act of 1995 (44 U.S.C. 3501 et seq.), the Securities and Exchange 
Commission (``Commission'') is soliciting comments on the collection of 
information summarized below. The Commission plans to submit this 
existing collection of information to the Office of Management and 
Budget for extension and approval.
    Rule 12g3-2 (17 CFR 240.12g3-2) under the Securities Exchange Act 
of 1934 (the ``Exchange Act'') provides an exemption from Section 12(g) 
of the Exchange Act (15 U.S.C. 78l(g)) for foreign private issuers. 
Rule 12g3-2 is designed to provide investors in foreign securities with 
information about such securities and the foreign issuer. The 
information filed under Rule 12g3-2 must be filed with the Commission 
and is publicly available. We estimate that it takes 8.95 hours per 
response to prepare and is filed by approximately 1,386 respondents. 
Each respondent files an estimated 12 times submissions pursuant to 
Rule 12g3-2 per year for a total of 16,632 respondents. We estimate 
that 25% of 8.95 hours per response (2.237 hours per response) to 
provide the information required under Rule 12g3-2 for a total annual 
reporting burden of 37,206 hours (2.237 hours per response x 16,632 
responses).
    Written comments are invited on: (a) whether this proposed 
collection of information is necessary for the proper performance of 
the functions of the agency, including whether the information will 
have practical utility; (b) the accuracy of the agency's estimate of 
the burden imposed by the collection of information; (c) ways to 
enhance the quality, utility, and clarity of the information collected; 
and (d) ways to minimize the burden of the collection of information on 
respondents, including through the use of automated collection 
techniques or other forms of information technology. Consideration will 
be given to comments and suggestions submitted in writing within 60 
days of this publication by June 14, 2024.

    An agency may not conduct or sponsor, and a person is not required 
to respond to, a collection of information unless it displays a 
currently valid control number.
