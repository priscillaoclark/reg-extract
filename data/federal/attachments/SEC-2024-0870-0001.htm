SECURITIES AND EXCHANGE COMMISSION

[SEC File No. 270-050, OMB Control No. 3235-0060]


Proposed Collection; Comment Request; Extension: Exchange Act 
Form 8-K

Upon Written Request Copies Available From: Securities and Exchange 
Commission, Office of FOIA Services, 100 F Street NE, Washington, DC 
20549-2736

    Notice is hereby given that, pursuant to the Paperwork Reduction 
Act of 1995 (44 U.S.C. 3501 et seq.), the Securities and Exchange 
Commission (``Commission'') is soliciting comments on the collection of 
information summarized below. The Commission plans to submit this 
existing collection of information to the Office of Management and 
Budget for extension and approval.
---------------------------------------------------------------------------

    \37\ 17 CFR 200.30-3(a)(12).
---------------------------------------------------------------------------

    Form 8-K (17 CFR 249.308) is filed by issuers to satisfy their 
current reporting obligations pursuant to Sections 13 and 15(d) of the 
Securities Exchange Act of 1934 (15 U.S.C. 78m and 78o(d)) in 
connection with the occurrence of significant corporate events. The 
purpose of Form 8-K is to provide investors with prompt disclosure of 
material information so that investors will be able to make investment 
and voting decisions better informed and receive information more-
timely. We estimate that Form 8-K takes 8.414583 hours per response and 
is filed by 70,560 responses annually. We estimate that 75% of the 
8.414583 hours per response (6.31094 hours) is prepared by the issuer 
for a total annual reporting burden of 445,300 hours (6.31094 hours per 
response x 70,560 responses).
    Written comments are invited on: (a) whether this proposed 
collection of information is necessary for the proper performance of 
the functions of the agency, including whether the information will 
have practical utility; (b) the accuracy of the agency's estimate of 
the burden imposed by the collection of information; (c) ways to 
enhance the quality, utility, and clarity of the information collected; 
and (d) ways to minimize the burden of the collection of information on 
respondents, including through the use of automated collection 
techniques or other forms of information technology. Consideration will 
be given to comments and suggestions submitted in writing within 60 
days of this publication by August 30, 2024.
    An agency may not conduct or sponsor, and a person is not required 
to respond to, a collection of information unless it displays a 
currently valid control number.
    Please direct your written comment to David Bottom, Director/Chief 
Information Officer, Securities and Exchange Commission, c/o John 
Pezzullo, 100 F Street NE, Washington, DC 20549 or send an email to:
