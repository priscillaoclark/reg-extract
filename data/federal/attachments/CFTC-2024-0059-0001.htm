SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION: Under the PRA, 44 U.S.C. 3501 et seq., 
Federal agencies must obtain approval from the Office of Management and 
Budget (OMB) for each collection of information they conduct or 
sponsor. ``Collection of information'' is defined in 44 U.S.C. 3502(3) 
and 5 CFR 1320.3(c) and includes agency requests or requirements that 
members of the public submit reports, keep records, or provide 
information to a third party. Section 3506(c)(2)(A) of the PRA, 44 
U.S.C. 3506(c)(2)(A), requires Federal agencies to provide a 60-day 
notice in the Federal Register concerning each proposed collection of 
information, including each proposed extension of an existing 
collection of information, before submitting the collection to OMB for 
approval. To comply with this requirement, the CFTC is publishing 
notice of the proposed extension of an existing collection of 
information listed below. An agency may not conduct or sponsor, and a 
person is not required to respond to a collection of information

---------------------------------------------------------------------------

    Title: Rules Relating to Regulation of Domestic Exchange-Traded 
Options, OMB Control Number 3038-0007. This is a request for extension 
of a currently approved collection.
    Abstract: Commission Regulations 33.7 and 33.8,\2\ respectively, 
require futures commission merchants (FCMs) and introducing brokers 
(IBs): (1) to provide retail (i.e., non-eligible contract participant) 
\3\ customers with, and retain, standard risk disclosure statements 
concerning the risk of trading certain domestic exchange-traded 
commodity options; \4\ and (2) to retain all related promotional 
material and the source of authority for information contained therein. 
These requirements help assure that these customers are not 
fraudulently induced to invest in these commodity options by persons 
who misrepresent the risks of such transactions. The recordkeeping 
requirements assist the Commission and the National Futures Association 
(NFA) in verifying registrants' compliance with their disclosure 
obligations and ensuring that related promotional material is not 
fraudulent or misleading.
---------------------------------------------------------------------------

    \2\ 17 CFR 33.7 and 33.8.
    \3\ Commission Regulation 33.7 does not require FCMs or IBs to 
provide the disclosure or obtain a related acknowledgment from 
institutional customers. See 17 CFR 33.7(a)(1). Commission 
Regulation 1.3 provides that ``institutional customer'' has the same 
meaning as ``eligible contract participant'' (``ECP'') as defined in 
section 1a(18) of the Commodity Exchange Act (``CEA''). Under the 
CEA, an ECP includes, for example, a financial institution, an 
insurance company, and a corporation with $10 million in assets.
    \4\ See Commission Regulation 33.2(b). 17 CFR 33.2(b) (providing 
that Part 33 of the Commission's Regulations applies to commodity 
option transactions that are options on contracts of sale of a 
commodity for future delivery except for commodity option 
transactions that are options on contracts of sale of a commodity 
for future delivery conducted or executed on or subject to the rules 
of a foreign board of trade).
---------------------------------------------------------------------------

    This information collection contains the third-party disclosure and 
recordkeeping requirements needed to ensure regulatory compliance by 
FCMs and IBs with these Commission Regulations.
    With respect to the above collection of information, the CFTC 
invites comments on:
    <bullet> Whether the proposed collection of information is 
necessary for the proper performance of the functions of the 
Commission, including whether the information will have a practical 
use;
    <bullet> The accuracy of the Commission's estimate of the burden of 
the proposed collection of information, including the validity of the 
methodology and assumptions used;
    <bullet> Ways to enhance the quality, usefulness, and clarity of 
the information to be collected; and
    <bullet> Ways to minimize the burden of collection of information 
on those who are to respond, including through the use of appropriate 
automated electronic, mechanical, or other technological collection 
techniques or other forms of information technology; e.g., permitting 
electronic submission of responses.
    All comments must be submitted in English, or if not, accompanied 
by an English translation. Comments will be posted as received to 
<a href="https://www.cftc.gov">https://www.cftc.gov</a>. You should submit only information that you wish 
to make available publicly. If you wish the Commission to consider 
information that you believe is exempt from disclosure under the 
Freedom of Information Act, a petition for confidential treatment of 
the exempt information may be submitted according to the procedures 
established in section 145.9 of the Commission's regulations.\5\
---------------------------------------------------------------------------

    \5\ 17 CFR 145.9, 74 FR 17395 (Apr. 15, 2009).
---------------------------------------------------------------------------

    The Commission reserves the right, but shall have no obligation to, 
review, pre-screen, filter, redact, refuse or remove any or all of your 
submission from <a href="https://www.cftc.gov">https://www.cftc.gov</a> that it may deem to be 
inappropriate for publication, such as obscene language. All 
submissions that have been redacted or removed that contain comments on 
the merits of the Information Collection Requirement will be retained 
in the public comment file and will be considered as required under the 
Administrative Procedure Act and other applicable laws, and may be 
accessible under the Freedom of Information Act.
    Burden Statement: The Commission estimates the burden of this 
collection of information as follows:
    Estimated Number of Annual Respondents: 983.
    Estimated Average Annual Burden Hours per Respondent: 34.2.
    Estimated Total Annual Burden Hours: 33,619.
    Frequency of Collection: On occasion.
    There are no capital costs or operating and maintenance costs 
associated with this collection.
