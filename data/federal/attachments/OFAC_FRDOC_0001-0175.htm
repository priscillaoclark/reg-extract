Background

    On September 23, 2001, the President issued Executive Order 13224 
(the ``Order'') pursuant to the International Emergency Economic Powers 
Act, 50 U.S.C. 1701-1706, and the United Nations Participation Act of 
1945, 22 U.S.C. 287c, imposing economic sanctions on persons who 
commit, threaten to commit, or support acts of terrorism. The President 
identified in the Annex to the Order various individuals and entities 
as subject to the economic sanctions. The Order authorizes the 
Secretary of the Treasury, in consultation with the Secretary of State, 
the Attorney General, and (pursuant to Executive Order 13284) the 
Secretary of the Department of Homeland Security, to designate 
additional persons or entities determined to meet certain criteria set 
forth in Executive Order 13224.
    On September 5, 2003 and on November 10, 2003, two additional 
individuals were designated by the Secretary of the Treasury. The 
Department of the Treasury's Office of Foreign Assets Control has 
determined that these two individuals no longer meet the criteria for 
designation under the Order and are appropriate for removal from the 
list of Specially Designated Nationals and Blocked Persons.

Designated Nationals and Blocked Persons:

the two individuals that are in or hereafter come within the United 
States or the possession or control of United States persons are now 
unblocked.
