SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION: 
    OMB Number: 3133-0004.
    Title: NCUA Call Report.
    Type of Review: Revision of a currently approved collection.
    Abstract: Sections 106 and 202 of the Federal Credit Union Act 
require federally insured credit unions (FICUs) to make financial 
reports to the NCUA. Section 741.6 of the NCUA Rules and Regulations 
requires all FICUs to submit a Call Report quarterly. Financial 
information collected through the Call Report is essential to NCUA 
supervision of Federal credit unions. This information also facilitates 
NCUA monitoring of other credit unions with share accounts insured by 
the National Credit Union Share Insurance Fund (NCUSIF).
    Affected Public: Private Sector: Not-for-profit institutions.
    Estimated Number of Respondents: 4,686.

    Estimated Total Annual Responses: 18,744.

    Estimated Total Annual Burden Hours: 74,976.
    Reason for Change: Burden decreased due to the number of 
respondents decreasing.

    OMB Number: 3133-0040.
    Title: Federal Credit Union Occupancy, Planning, and Disposal of 
Acquired and Abandoned Premises--12 CFR 701.36.
    Type of Review: Revision of a currently approved collection.
    Abstract: Section 107(4) of the Federal Credit Union Act authorizes 
a Federal credit union (FCU) to purchase, hold, and dispose of property 
necessary or incidental to its operations. Section 701.36 of NCUA Rules 
and Regulations interprets and implements this provision of the FCU Act 
by establishing occupancy, planning, and disposal requirements for 
acquired and abandoned premises. It also prohibits certain 
transactions. In addition, this section includes provisions in which an 
FCU may seek a waiver from certain requirements of the rule. NCUA 
reviews written waiver requests and makes a determination on the 
request based on safety and soundness considerations.
    Affected Public: Private Sector: Not-for-profit institutions.

FICUs are required to execute a written loan participation agreement
