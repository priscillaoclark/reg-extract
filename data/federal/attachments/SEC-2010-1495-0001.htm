(``Act'') \1\ and Rule 19b-4 thereunder,\2\ notice is hereby given that 
on September 16, 2010, the Chicago Stock Exchange, Inc. (``CHX'' or

the proposal pursuant to Section 19(b)(3)(A) of the Act \3\ and Rule

I. Self-Regulatory Organization's Statement of the Terms of the 
Substance of the Proposed Rule Change

    The CHX proposes to amend its Schedule of Participant Fees and 
Assessments (the ``Fee Schedule''), effective September 20, 2010, to 
change its transaction fees and rebates to Exchange Participants for 
transactions involving issues priced less than one dollar that occur 
within the Exchange's Matching System. The text of this proposed rule 
change is available on the Exchange's Web site at <A HREF="http://frwebgate.access.gpo.gov/cgi-bin/leaving.cgi?from=leavingFR.html&log=linklog&to=http://www.chx.com/rules/proposed_rules.htm">http://www.chx.com/
rules/proposed_rules.htm</A> and in the Commission's Public Reference 
Room, 100 F Street, NE., Washington, DC 20549.

II. Self-Regulatory Organization's Statement of the Purpose of, and 
Statutory Basis for, the Proposed Rule Change

    In its filing with the Commission, the CHX included statements 
concerning the purpose of and basis for the proposed rule changes and 
discussed any comments it received regarding the proposal. The text of 
these statements may be examined at the places specified

[[Page 60153]]

in Item IV below. The CHX has prepared summaries, set forth in sections 
A, B and C below, of the most significant aspects of such statements.

A. Self-Regulatory Organization's Statement of the Purpose of, and 
Statutory Basis for, the Proposed Rule Change

1. Purpose
    Through this filing, the Exchange would amend its Fee Schedule to 
change the provide credit to Exchange Participants for transactions 
involving issues priced less than one dollar that occur within the 
Exchange's Matching System.
    The Exchange proposes to change the provide credit in the 
transactions described above from 0.20% of the trade value to $0.00009 
per share executed. The Exchange notes that this pricing structure for 
transactions in securities priced under $1 is similar to those used by 
some of our competitors which have been recently approved by the 
Commission.\5\ The proposed change in the provide credit will help us 
remain competitive while maximizing the income derived from 
transactions in securities priced under $1.
---------------------------------------------------------------------------

    \5\ For example, The NASDAQ Stock Market LLC changed its rebate 
for transactions in securities priced under $1 from 0.1% of the 
total dollar value to $0.00009 per share in May of 2010. See 
Securities Exchange Act Release No. 62138 (May 19, 2010), 75 29596 
(May 26, 2010) (SR-NASDAQ-2010-059).
---------------------------------------------------------------------------

2. Statutory Basis
    The Exchange believes that the proposed rule change is consistent 
with Section 6(b) of the Act \6\ in general, and furthers the 
objectives of Section 6(b)(4) of the Act \7\ in particular, in that it 
provides for the equitable allocation of reasonable dues, fees and 
other charges among its members. Among other things, the change to the 
fee schedule would provide incentives to Participants to increase the 
amount of liquidity provided on our trading facilities for securities 
priced less than $1, which may contribute to an increase in trading 
volume on the Exchange and in the income derived therefrom.

    \7\ 15 U.S.C. 78f(b)(4)
---------------------------------------------------------------------------

B. Self-Regulatory Organization's Statement on Burden on Competition

    The Exchange does not believe that the proposed rule change will 
impose any burden on competition that is not necessary or appropriate 
in furtherance of the purposes of the Act.

C. Self-Regulatory Organization's Statement on Comments Regarding the 
Proposed Rule Change Received From Members, Participants or Others

    No written comments were either solicited or received.

III. Date of Effectiveness of the Proposed Rule Change and Timing for 
Commission Action

    The foregoing rule change has become effective pursuant to Section 
19(B)(3)(A)(ii) of the Act \8\ and subparagraph (f)(2) of Rule 19b-4 
thereunder \9\ because it establishes or changes a due, fee, or other 
charge applicable only to a member imposed by the self-regulatory 
organization. Accordingly, the proposal is effective upon Commission 
receipt of the filing. At any time within 60-days of the filing of the 
proposed rule change, the Commission summarily may temporarily suspend 
such rule change if it appears to the Commission that such action is 
necessary or appropriate in the public interest, for the protection of 
investors, or otherwise in furtherance of the purposes of the Act.
