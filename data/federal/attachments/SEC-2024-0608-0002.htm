SECURITIES AND EXCHANGE COMMISSION

[SEC File No. 270-563, OMB Control No. 3235-0656]


Submission for OMB Review; Comment Request; Extension: Rule 17g-7

Upon Written Request, Copies Available From: Securities and Exchange 
Commission, Office of FOIA Services, 100 F Street NE, Washington, DC 
20549-2736

    Notice is hereby given that pursuant to the Paperwork Reduction Act 
of 1995 (44 U.S.C. 3501 et seq.), the Securities and Exchange 
Commission (``Commission'') is soliciting comments on the collection of 
information summarized below. The Commission plans to submit an 
extension for this current collection of information to the Office of 
Management and Budget for approval.
    Rule 17g-7 (17 CFR 240.17g-7) requires each nationally recognized 
statistical rating organization (``NRSROs'') to publish certain items, 
including a form containing specified information, when taking a rating 
action with respect to a credit rating \1\ and to disclose rating 
histories for free on an easily accessible portion of its corporate 
internet website.\2\ There are currently 10 NRSROs registered with the 
Commission, and it is estimated that the NRSROs will take collectively 
approximately 1,908,530 rating actions per year.
---------------------------------------------------------------------------

    \1\ See 240.17g-7(a).
    \2\ See 240.17g-7(b).
---------------------------------------------------------------------------

    Based on Commission staff's experience, it is estimated that the 
total annual hour burden to comply with Rule 17g-7 will be 641,673 
hours. The Commission further estimates that this annual hour burden 
will result in a total annual cost of $238,688,856, reflecting the cost 
of preparing the form required to be published by Rule 17g-7 and 
standardizing and tailoring certain required disclosures, and the cost 
of maintaining a database of rating histories to comply with Rule 17g-
7.
    An agency may not conduct or sponsor, and a person is not required 
to respond to, a collection of information under the PRA unless it 
displays a currently valid OMB control number.
    The public may view background documentation for this information 
collection at the following website: <a href="http://www.reginfo.gov">www.reginfo.gov</a>. Find this 
particular information collection by selecting ``Currently under 30-day
