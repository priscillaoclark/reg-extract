[[Page 61424]]

    General description of collection: This triennial survey is the 
only source of representative information on the structure of U.S. 
families' finances. The survey collects data on the assets, debts, 
income, work history, pension rights, use of financial services, and 
attitudes of a sample of U.S. families. Because the ownership of some 
assets is relatively concentrated in a small number of families, the 
survey makes a special effort to ensure proper representation of such 
assets by systematically oversampling wealthier families. For the 2025 
survey, the Board will conduct: (1) up to 150 interviews averaging 
about 110 minutes as a test or series of tests of the survey procedures 
in 2025, and (2) up to 7,000 interviews averaging about 110 minutes 
(main survey) between April 2025 and March 2026.
    Frequency: Triennial.
    Respondents: U.S. families.
    Total estimated number of respondents: 7,150.
    Total estimated annual burden hours: 4,410.
    Current actions: On March 7, 2024, the Board published a notice in 
the Federal Register (89 FR 16571) requesting public comment for 60 
days on the extension, without revision, of the FR 3059. The comment 
period for this notice expired on May 6, 2024. The Board did not 
receive any comments.

    Board of Governors of the Federal Reserve System, July 25, 2024.
Michele Taylor Fennell,
Deputy Associate Secretary of the Board.
