SECURITIES AND EXCHANGE COMMISSION

[SEC File No. 270-659, OMB Control No. 3235-0723]


Proposed Collection; Comment Request; Extension: Form 1-Z

Upon Written Request Copies Available From: Securities and Exchange 
Commission, Office of FOIA Services, 100 F Street NE, Washington, DC 
20549-2736

    Notice is hereby given that, pursuant to the Paperwork Reduction 
Act of 1995 (44 U.S.C. 3501 et seq.), the Securities and Exchange 
Commission (``Commission'') is soliciting comments on the collection of 
information summarized below. The Commission plans to submit this 
existing collection of information to the Office of Management and 
Budget for extension and approval.
    Form 1-Z (17 CFR 239.94) is used to report terminated or completed 
offerings or to suspend the duty to file ongoing reports under 
Regulation A, an exemption from registration under the Securities Act 
of 1933 (15 U.S.C 77a et seq.). The purpose of the Form 1-Z is to 
collect empirical data for the Commission on offerings conducted under 
Regulation A that have terminated or completed, to indicate to the 
Commission that issuers that have conducted Tier 2 offering are 
suspending their duty to file reports under Regulation A and to provide 
such information to the investing public. We estimate that 
approximately 51 issuers file Form 1-Z annually. We estimate that Form 
1-Z takes approximately 1.5 hours to prepare. We estimate that 100% of 
the 1.5 hours per response is prepared by the company for a total 
annual burden of 77 hours (1.5 hours per response x 51 responses).
    Written comments are invited on: (a) whether this proposed 
collection of information is necessary for the proper performance of 
the functions of the agency, including whether the information will 
have practical utility; (b) the accuracy of the agency's estimate of 
the burden imposed by the collection of information; (c) ways to 
enhance the quality, utility, and clarity of the information collected; 
and (d) ways to minimize the burden of the collection of information on 
respondents, including through the use of automated collection 
techniques or other forms of information technology. Consideration will 
be given to comments and suggestions submitted in writing within 60 
days of this publication by October 15, 2024.
    An agency may not conduct or sponsor, and a person is not required 
to respond to, a collection of information unless it displays a 
currently valid control number.
    Please direct your written comment to Austin Gerig, Director/Chief 
Data Officer, Securities and Exchange Commission, c/o Oluwaseun Ajayi, 
100 F Street NE, Washington, DC 20549 or send an email to:

Vanessa A. Countryman,
Secretary.
