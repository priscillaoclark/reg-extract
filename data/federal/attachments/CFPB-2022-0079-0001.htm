SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION:
    Title of Collection: The Effect of Different Savings Elicitation 
Strategies on Emergency Savings Targets.
    OMB Control Number: 3170-0048.
    Type of Review: Request for approval of a generic information 
collection under an existing Generic Information Collection Plan.
    Affected Public: Individuals.
    Estimated Number of Respondents: 6,000.
    Estimated Total Annual Burden Hours: 3,000.
    Abstract: This project examines how the framing of savings plans 
can help consumers establish emergency savings. The Bureau plans to 
test whether asking consumers to think about opportunity costs for 
their money helps them save more effectively for emergencies. Our 
findings can inform Bureau-developed content aimed at helping Americans 
be better prepared for emergencies. The Bureau will conduct several 
studies as part of this project asking participants about their savings 
goals. Each study will involve unique participants. We expect to 
recruit about 6,000 participants across the life of the project. The 
Bureau will not receive any personally identifying information (PII). 
Any PII will be scrubbed by the contractor. We will collect 
demographics, psychological measures around savings, and consumers' 
savings goals. The Bureau originally published this notice on 12/29/
2021 (86 FR 74075). However, the Bureau is now reissuing this notice 
due to an incorrect comment period end date. Bureau staff made no other 
changes to this notice or its description of the contained information 
collection requirements.
    Request for Comments: The Bureau is publishing this notice and 
soliciting comments on: (a) Whether the collection of information is 
necessary for the proper performance of the functions of the Bureau, 
including whether the information will have practical utility; (b) The 
accuracy of the Bureau's estimate of the burden of the collection of 
information, including the validity of the methods and the assumptions 
used; (c) Ways to enhance the quality, utility, and clarity of the 
information to be collected; and (d) Ways to minimize the burden of the 
collection of information on respondents, including through the use of 
automated collection techniques or other forms of information 
technology. Comments submitted in response to this notice will be 
submitted to OMB as part of its review of this request. All comments 
will become a matter of public record.

Anthony May,
Paperwork Reduction Act Officer, Bureau of Consumer Financial 
Protection.
