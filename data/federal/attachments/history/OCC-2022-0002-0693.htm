SUMMARY: The Office of the Comptroller of the Currency (OCC), the Board 
of Governors of the Federal Reserve System (Board), and the Federal 
Deposit Insurance Corporation (FDIC) (together referred to as the 
agencies, and each, individually, the agency) are issuing this 
supplemental rulemaking related to the agencies' Community Reinvestment 
Act (CRA) final rule issued on October 24, 2023, and published in the 
Federal Register on February 1, 2024 (2023 CRA Final Rule). The 
rulemaking has two components. First, the agencies are adopting an 
interim final rule that amends, and requests comment on, the 
applicability date of the facility-based assessment areas provision and 
public file provision included in the 2023 CRA Final Rule. Second, the 
agencies are adopting a final rule that makes technical amendments to 
the 2023 CRA Final Rule and related regulations. In addition to the 
rulemaking, this document makes a correction to the preamble to the 
2023 CRA Final Rule regarding the OCC's Unfunded Mandates Reform Act 
(UMRA) regulatory analysis.

DATES: 
    Effective date: This rule (including interim final rule and 
technical amendments) is effective on April 1, 2024.
    Comment due date: Comments on the interim final rule (regarding the 
applicability date for Sec. Sec.  25.16, 25.43, 228.16, 228.43, 345.16, 
and 345.43) must be received by May 13, 2024.

SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION:

I. Introduction

    The CRA \1\ requires the agencies to assess a bank's \2\ record of 
meeting the credit needs of its entire community, including low- and 
moderate-income neighborhoods, consistent with the bank's safe and 
sound operation. Upon completing this assessment, the statute requires 
the agencies to ``prepare a written evaluation of the institution's 
record of meeting the credit needs of its entire community, including 
low- and moderate-income neighborhoods.'' \3\ The statute further 
provides that each agency must consider a bank's CRA performance ``in 
its evaluation of an application for a deposit facility by such 
institution.'' \4\ The agencies implement the CRA and establish the 
framework and criteria by which the agencies assess a bank's 
performance through their individual CRA regulations.\5\
---------------------------------------------------------------------------

    \1\ 12 U.S.C. 2901 et seq.
    \2\ For purposes of this SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION, the term 
``bank'' includes insured national and State banks, Federal and 
State savings associations, Federal branches as defined in 12 CFR 
part 28, insured State branches as defined in 12 CFR 345.11(c), and 
State member banks as defined in 12 CFR part 208, except as provided 
in 12 CFR __.11(c). See also note 5.
    \3\ 12 U.S.C. 2906(a).
    \4\ 12 U.S.C. 2903(a)(2).
    \5\ See 12 CFR parts 25 (OCC), 228 (Regulation BB) (Board), and 
345 (FDIC). For clarity and to streamline references, citations to 
the agencies' common CRA regulations are provided in the following 
format: 12 CFR __.xx. For example, references to 12 CFR 25.16 (OCC), 
228.16 (Board), and 345.16 (FDIC) are streamlined as follows: ``12 
CFR __.16.''
---------------------------------------------------------------------------

    On October 24, 2023, the agencies issued the 2023 CRA Final Rule 
amending their CRA regulations to update how CRA activities qualify for 
consideration, where CRA activities are considered, and how CRA 
activities are evaluated. The 2023 CRA Final Rule was published in the 
Federal Register on February 1, 2024,\6\ and it takes effect on April 
1, 2024, with staggered applicability dates of April 1, 2024, January 
1, 2026, and January 1, 2027.
---------------------------------------------------------------------------

    \6\ 89 FR 6574 (Feb. 1, 2024).
---------------------------------------------------------------------------

    As described in more detail below, this supplemental rulemaking 
includes two parts. First, the agencies are issuing an interim final 
rule to extend the applicability date of the facility-based assessment 
areas provision and the public file provision in the 2023 CRA Final 
Rule (Sec. Sec.  __.16 and __.43,

[[Page 22062]]

respectively) from April 1, 2024, to January 1, 2026. The agencies are 
requesting comment on these changes.
    Second, the agencies are issuing a final rule that makes technical 
amendments to those amendments adopted in the 2023 CRA Final Rule and 
related regulations. These technical amendments do not change the 
substance or meaning of the 2023 CRA Final Rule. As discussed in more 
detail in this SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION, the technical amendments to 
the 2023 CRA Final Rule are as follows:
    <bullet> The agencies are jointly (1) amending the transition 
provision (Sec.  __.51) to clarify the applicability date of the public 
notice provision (Sec.  __.44); and (2) amending the strategic plan 
provision (Sec.  __.27) to correct an omission from the agency-specific 
amendments.
    <bullet> The Board and the FDIC are (1) correcting a cross-
reference in an otherwise incomplete amendatory instruction for 
appendix B (Calculations for the Community Development Tests); and (2) 
amending their agency-specific versions of appendix G, which reproduces 
the CRA regulations in effect on March 31, 2024 (legacy CRA 
regulations), to reflect separate amendments made to the bank asset-
size thresholds since the issuance of the 2023 CRA Final Rule.
    <bullet> The Board is making a technical amendment to its authority 
section in Sec.  228.11.
    Further, the agencies are making technical amendments to their 
regulations implementing the CRA sunshine requirements of the Federal 
Deposit Insurance Act \7\ (CRA Sunshine regulations) (12 CFR parts 35 
(OCC), 207 (Regulation G) (Board), and 346 (FDIC)) and the OCC is 
making technical amendments to its community and economic development 
entities, community development projects, and other public welfare 
investments regulation (Public Welfare Investment regulation) (12 CFR 
part 24) to update cross-references to their CRA regulations to conform 
with changes made by the 2023 CRA Final Rule. The OCC also is updating 
a cross-reference to the agency's CRA regulation in its conversions 
from mutual to stock form regulation (12 CFR part 192).
---------------------------------------------------------------------------

    \7\ Codified at 12 U.S.C. 1831y.

    Finally, this document corrects language in the preamble of the 
Federal Register document issuing the 2023 CRA Final Rule with respect 
to the OCC's UMRA \8\ discussion.

II. Interim Final Rule

    As described below, the agencies are issuing an interim final rule 
to extend the applicability date of the facility-based assessment areas 
provision and the public file provision in the 2023 CRA Final Rule 
(Sec. Sec.  __.16 and __.43, respectively) from April 1, 2024, to 
January 1, 2026. The agencies are requesting comment on these changes.
    Facility-based assessment areas (Section __.16). Section __.16 of 
the 2023 CRA Final Rule provides that a bank must delineate one or more 
facility-based assessment areas within which the agencies evaluate the 
bank's record of helping to meet the credit needs of its entire 
community. This section prescribes the types of deposit-taking 
facilities that trigger the requirement to delineate a facility-based 
assessment area, the geographic requirements of a facility-based 
assessment area, and other limitations on the delineation of facility-
based assessment areas. For example, Sec.  __.16(b)(2) provides that, 
except as provided in Sec.  __.16(b)(3), each of a bank's facility-
based assessment areas must consist of a single metropolitan 
statistical area (MSA), one or more contiguous counties within an MSA, 
or one or more contiguous counties within the nonmetropolitan area of a 
State. Section __.16(b)(3) provides that an intermediate bank or a 
small bank may adjust the boundaries of its facility-based assessment 
areas to include only the portion of a county that it reasonably can be 
expected to serve, further stipulating that such a facility-based 
assessment area must consist of contiguous whole-census tracts and 
comply with the limitations in Sec.  __.16(c).\9\
---------------------------------------------------------------------------

    \9\ Section __.16(c) provides that facility-based assessment 
areas may not reflect illegal discrimination and may not arbitrarily 
exclude low- or moderate-income census tracts. See Sec.  __.16(c)(1) 
and (2).
---------------------------------------------------------------------------

    As published in the Federal Register on February 1, 2024, Sec.  
__.51(a) of the 2023 CRA Final Rule provides that the facility-based 
assessment areas requirements in Sec.  __.16 apply as of April 1, 2024. 
In the course of implementation work, the agencies have identified and 
considered issues arising due to this applicability date, including 
potential uncertainty raised by some banks regarding how to comply with 
Sec.  __.16 as of April 1, 2024. As a result, and as discussed further 
below, the agencies are extending the applicability date of Sec.  __.16 
to January 1, 2026.
    Specifically, the agencies recognize that Sec.  __.16 references 
certain provisions and terms of the 2023 CRA Final Rule that do not 
apply until January 1, 2026.\10\ For example, Sec.  __.16(a) references 
``the performance tests and strategic plan described in Sec.  __.21'' 
of the 2023 CRA Final Rule, which are not applicable until January 1, 
2026.\11\ Additionally, the asset-size thresholds for intermediate 
small banks and large banks in the agencies' legacy CRA regulations 
\12\ (which apply during the transition period) and the asset-size 
thresholds for intermediate banks and large banks in the 2023 CRA Final 
Rule \13\ (which apply as of January 1, 2026) are different. Thus, 
certain banks that will be considered large banks during the transition 
period may be considered intermediate banks after the transition period 
ends, on January 1, 2026. As a result, these large banks will be 
required to delineate facility-based assessment areas consisting of 
full counties beginning on April 1, 2024; \14\ however, once they are 
re-designated as intermediate banks as of January 1, 2026, these same 
banks will have the option to delineate facility-based assessment areas 
consisting of partial counties.\15\ Finally, delineating facility-based 
assessment areas under new requirements beginning April 1, 2024, 
involves evaluating banks according to different facility-based 
assessment area delineation standards within a single year.
---------------------------------------------------------------------------

    \10\ See Sec.  __.51(a)(2)(i) (listing the provisions of the 
2023 CRA Final Rule that apply as of January 1, 2026, including 
Sec.  __.12 (Definitions) and Sec.  __.21 (Evaluation of CRA 
performance in general)).
    \11\ See Sec.  __.51(a).
    \12\ See Sec.  25.12(u) of appendix G to 12 CFR part 25 (OCC); 
Sec.  228.12(u) of appendix G to 12 CFR part 228 (Board); and Sec.  
345.12(u) of appendix G to 12 CFR part 345 (defining ``small bank'' 
and ``intermediate small bank''). See also 88 FR 87895 (Dec. 20, 
2023) and OCC Bulletin 2023-40 (December 26, 2023) for bank asset-
size thresholds effective as of January 1, 2024.
    \13\ See Sec. Sec.  25.12 (OCC); 228.12 (Board); and 345.12 
(FDIC) (defining ``intermediate bank'' and ``large bank'') as 
amended by the 2023 CRA Final Rule.
    \14\ See Sec.  __.16(b)(2).
    \15\ See Sec.  __.16(b)(3).
---------------------------------------------------------------------------

    On further consideration, the agencies are aligning the 
applicability date of Sec.  __.16 with the applicability date of the 
performance tests \16\ and other geographic area provisions \17\--
January 1, 2026--to promote greater stability

[[Page 22063]]

and certainty for banks and other stakeholders in transitioning to the 
provisions of the 2023 CRA Final Rule. In addition, by moving the 
applicability date to the beginning of a calendar year, the interim 
final rule will eliminate potential confusion resulting from evaluating 
banks according to different facility-based assessment area delineation 
standards within a single year.
---------------------------------------------------------------------------

    \16\ See Sec.  __.22 (Retail lending test), Sec.  __.23 (Retail 
services and products test), Sec.  __.24 (Community development 
financing test), Sec.  __.25 (Community development services test), 
and Sec.  __.26 (Limited purpose banks), Sec.  __.29 (Small bank 
performance evaluation), and Sec.  __.30 (Intermediate bank 
performance evaluation). See also Sec.  __.27 (Strategic plan).
    \17\ See Sec.  __.17 (Retail lending assessment areas), Sec.  
__.18 (Outside retail lending areas), and Sec.  __.19 (Areas for 
eligible community development loans, community development 
investments, and community development services).
---------------------------------------------------------------------------

    Content and availability of public file (Section __.43). Section 
__.43 of the 2023 CRA Final Rule requires a bank to maintain a public 
file, in either paper or digital format, that includes specific 
information related to the bank's branches, services, and performance 
in helping meet community credit needs. Section __.51(a) of the 2023 
CRA Final Rule provides that the public file provision in Sec.  __.43 
applies as of April 1, 2024.
    As detailed in the 2023 CRA Final Rule, Sec.  __.43 largely retains 
the public file requirements of the agencies' legacy CRA 
regulations,\18\ with revisions to clarify aspects of the requirements 
and to reflect relevant terminology and provisions of the 2023 CRA 
Final Rule.\19\ Under the agencies' legacy CRA regulations, a bank's 
entire public file must be available for public inspection upon request 
at no cost: (1) at its main office; and (2) if a bank operates in more 
than one State, at one branch office in each of these States.\20\ The 
2023 CRA Final Rule revised the agencies' legacy CRA regulations to 
require any bank with a public website to include its CRA public file 
on its website.\21\ If a bank does not maintain a public website, the 
2023 CRA Final Rule requires a bank to maintain public file information 
consistent with the agencies' legacy CRA regulations--namely, at the 
main office and, if an interstate bank, at one branch office in each 
State.\22\
---------------------------------------------------------------------------

    \18\ See 12 CFR __.43 of the agencies' legacy CRA regulations.
    \19\ See 89 FR 6574, 7082-7085 (Feb. 1, 2024). For example, for 
reasons explained in the 2023 CRA Final Rule, the agencies clarified 
the meaning of ``current year'' in provisions requiring banks to 
include in the public file: all written comments received from the 
public for the current year and the prior two calendar years related 
to the bank's performance in helping to meet community credit needs, 
along with any responses by the bank (Sec.  __.43(a)(1)); and a list 
of branches opened or closed by the bank during the current year and 
each of the prior two calendar years (Sec.  __.43(a)(4)). 
Specifically, ``current year'' was clarified to require updates to 
the public file ``on a quarterly basis for the prior quarter by 
March 31, June 30, September 30, and December 31.'' See Sec.  
__.43(a)(1) and (a)(4).
    \20\ See 12 CFR __.43(c)(1) of the agencies' legacy CRA 
regulations.
    \21\ See Sec.  __.43(c)(1).
    \22\ See Sec.  __.43(c)(2).
---------------------------------------------------------------------------

    As with Sec.  __.16, the agencies believe that moving the 
applicability date of Sec.  __.43 from April 1, 2024, to January 1, 
2026, will alleviate potential confusion in complying with the public 
file requirements and promote greater stability and certainty for banks 
and other stakeholders in transitioning to the provisions of the 2023 
CRA Final Rule. Consistent with the considerations discussed above 
regarding Sec.  __.16, the agencies recognize that Sec.  __.43 
references certain provisions and terms of the 2023 CRA Final Rule that 
do not apply until January 1, 2026, or January 1, 2027.\23\ For 
example, Sec.  __.43 refers to terms defined in Sec.  __.12 of the 2023 
CRA Final Rule that do not apply until January 1, 2026, such as 
``facility-based assessment areas;'' \24\ ``retail lending assessment 
areas;'' \25\ ``operations subsidiaries'' or ``operating 
subsidiaries;'' \26\ ``large bank;'' \27\ and ``small bank.'' \28\
---------------------------------------------------------------------------

    \23\ See Sec.  __.51(a)(2)(i) (listing the provisions of the 
2023 CRA Final Rule that apply as of January 1, 2026, including 
Sec.  __.12 (Definitions) and Sec.  __.21 (Evaluation of CRA 
performance in general), and January 1, 2027 (Reporting 
requirements)).
    \24\ See Sec.  __.43(a)(6) and (c)(2)(ii)(B).
    \25\ See Sec.  __.43(a)(6).
    \26\ See Sec.  __.43(b)(1) and (b)(2)(i).
    \27\ See Sec.  __.43(b)(2)(ii).
    \28\ See Sec.  __.43(b)(3).
---------------------------------------------------------------------------

    In addition, aligning the applicability date of Sec.  __.43 with 
the performance tests of the 2023 CRA Final Rule--January 1, 2026--will 
ensure consistency in the public file requirements concerning consumer 
loans during the transition to the 2023 CRA Final Rule. Under the 
public file provision of the agencies' legacy CRA regulations, the 
public file of a bank (other than a small bank or a bank that was a 
small bank during the prior calendar year, as defined in the agencies' 
legacy CRA regulations \29\) must include data pertaining to any 
category of consumer loans the bank has elected to have considered 
under the lending test.\30\ Section __.43 of the 2023 CRA Final Rule, 
however, does not require disclosure of consumer loan information in 
the public file because most consumer loans will be considered 
qualitatively under the Retail Services and Products Test (Sec.  
__.23),\31\ with the exception of automobile loans for certain banks as 
specified in the Retail Lending Test provision of the 2023 CRA Final 
Rule (Sec.  __.22). Again, these performances tests are not applicable 
until January 1, 2026.\32\
---------------------------------------------------------------------------

    \29\ See Sec.  __.12(u) of the agencies' legacy CRA regulations; 
see also 88 FR 87895 (Dec. 20, 2023) and OCC Bulletin 2023-40 (Dec. 
26, 2023) (asset-size of a ``small bank'' as of Jan. 1, 2024).
    \30\ See Sec.  __.43(b)(1)(i) of the agencies' legacy CRA 
regulations.
    \31\ See 89 FR 6574, 7084 (Feb. 1, 2024).
    \32\ See Sec.  __.51(a)(2)(i).
---------------------------------------------------------------------------

    In the preamble to the 2023 CRA Final Rule, the agencies noted 
their commitment to engage with stakeholders in the implementation 
process and ensure that all stakeholders understand the regulatory 
requirements.\33\ Consistent with this commitment, the agencies have 
determined that extending the applicability date of Sec. Sec.  __.16 
and __.43 to January 1, 2026, is the most clear, timely, and effective 
way to avoid potential uncertainty that could result from an April 1, 
2024 applicability date for these provisions. The agencies remain 
committed to providing guidance and related resources on Sec. Sec.  
__.16 and __.43, as well as all other aspects of the 2023 CRA Final 
Rule.
---------------------------------------------------------------------------

    \33\ See 89 FR 6574, 7093 (Feb. 1, 2024).
---------------------------------------------------------------------------

    Although these amendments take effect on April 1, 2024, to coincide 
with the effective date of the 2023 CRA Final Rule, the agencies are 
requesting public comment on the changes to the applicability date for 
the facility-based assessment areas and public file provisions in 
Sec. Sec.  __.16 and __.43, respectively.

III. Technical Amendments

    The agencies are issuing a final rule that makes technical 
amendments to the 2023 CRA Final Rule and related regulations, as 
described below. These technical amendments do not change the substance 
or meaning of the 2023 CRA Final Rule.
    Public notice (Section __.44). The agencies are amending the 2023 
CRA Final Rule to clarify the agencies' intention that banks may 
continue to use the CRA Notice in the agencies' legacy CRA regulations 
until January 1, 2026. Section __.44 of the 2023 CRA Final Rule 
requires a bank to provide a CRA Notice in the public area of its main 
office and each of its branches, as set forth in appendix F, that 
includes, among other things, information about the availability of a 
bank's public file, the appropriate Federal financial supervisory 
agency's CRA examination schedule, and how a member of the public may 
provide public comment. The posting requirement in Sec.  __.44 is 
substantively the same as the longstanding CRA public notice 
requirement in 12 CFR __.44 (referencing the CRA Notice in appendix B) 
of the agencies' legacy CRA regulations, which are reproduced in

[[Page 22064]]

the 2023 CRA Final Rule as appendix G.\34\
---------------------------------------------------------------------------

    \34\ See appendix G to 12 CFR part 25 (appendix B) (OCC); 
appendix G to 12 CFR part 228 (appendix B) (Board); and appendix G 
to 12 CFR part 345 (appendix B) (FDIC).
---------------------------------------------------------------------------

    Section __.51(a) of the 2023 CRA Final Rule provides that the 
public notice requirements in Sec.  __.44 apply as of April 1, 2024, 
but Sec.  __.51(a) of the 2023 CRA Final Rule also provides that the 
CRA Notice reproduced in appendix F is applicable on January 1, 2026. 
Further, Sec.  __.51(a) provides that, with respect to provisions that 
are not applicable until after April 1, 2024, banks must instead comply 
with relevant provisions of the agencies' legacy CRA regulations, set 
forth in appendix G to the 2023 CRA Final Rule.\35\ Thus, because 
appendix F expressly does not apply until January 1, 2026, banks would 
need to comply with Sec.  __.44 of the 2023 CRA Final Rule as of April 
1, 2024, but use the CRA Notice in appendix G of the 2023 CRA Final 
Rule, which is the same notice banks were required to use prior to the 
2023 CRA Final Rule.
---------------------------------------------------------------------------

    \35\ See Sec.  __.51(a)(2)(iii) (cross-referencing Sec.  
__.51(a)(2)(i) and (ii)).
---------------------------------------------------------------------------

    The agencies are amending Sec.  __.51(a)(2)(i) to align the 
applicability date of the substantive public notice requirements in 
Sec.  __.44 with the applicability date of the CRA Notice in appendix 
F. The amendment to move the applicability date of Sec.  __.44 of the 
2023 CRA Final Rule to January 1, 2026, has no substantive effect. By 
providing that both Sec.  __.44 and appendix F are applicable as of 
January 1, 2026, amended Sec.  __.51(a)(2)(i) clarifies the agencies' 
intention in the 2023 CRA Final Rule that banks may continue to use the 
CRA Notice in the agencies' legacy CRA regulations, as provided in 
appendix G, to comply with public notice requirements until January 1, 
2026.
    Asset-size thresholds. As noted, appendix G of the 2023 CRA Final 
Rule includes the agencies' legacy CRA regulations, and reflects those 
regulations as of the date the agencies adopted the 2023 CRA Final 
Rule, October 24, 2023. Since that date, the agencies have increased 
the bank asset-size thresholds based on the year-to-year change in the 
average of the Consumer Price Index for Urban Wage Earners and Clerical 
Workers, pursuant to the annual inflation adjustment mechanism in the 
agencies' legacy CRA regulations,\36\ and the Board and the FDIC have 
amended their regulations to reflect this increase.\37\ These new 
asset-size thresholds are: (1) for small banks, less than $1.564 
billion as of December 31 of either of the prior two calendar years; 
and (2) for intermediate small banks, at least $391 million as of 
December 31 of both of the prior two calendar years and less than 
$1.564 billion as of December 31 of either of the prior two calendar 
years. The Board and the FDIC are updating the asset-size thresholds in 
appendix G to reflect these updated thresholds so that appendix G 
remains consistent with their legacy CRA regulations, as intended.
---------------------------------------------------------------------------

    \36\ See Sec. Sec.  __.12(u)(2) of the agencies' legacy CRA 
regulations.
    \37\ 88 FR 87895 (Dec. 20, 2023). The OCC does not amend its CRA 
regulation to reflect the annually adjusted asset-size thresholds. 
Instead, it issues an OCC Bulletin to announce the revised 
thresholds. See OCC Bulletin 2023-40 (December 26, 2023).
---------------------------------------------------------------------------

    Agency-specific technical amendments. The agencies are adopting a 
technical amendment to the agency-specific amendments in the 2023 CRA 
Final Rule to add a missing conforming amendment in their strategic 
plan provisions, Sec.  __.27. This amendment changes ``[Operations 
subsidiaries or operating subsidiaries]'' to ``Operation subsidiaries'' 
for the Board and ``Operating subsidiaries'' for the OCC and the FDIC. 
The Board and the FDIC also are adopting technical amendments to 
correct errors in amendatory instructions 50.c. and 73.c. in the 2023 
CRA Final Rule that made the instructions inoperable. These amendments 
correct cross-references in appendix B (Calculations for the Community 
Development Tests) to the 2023 CRA Final Rule. Further, the Board is 
making a technical amendment to its authority section in Sec.  228.11 
of the 2023 CRA Final Rule to replace ``the Federal Reserve'' with 
``the Board.''
    CRA Sunshine regulations and OCC Public Welfare Investment 
regulation. The agencies are amending their CRA Sunshine regulations 
\38\ to update the cross-references explained below to conform with 
changes made by the 2023 CRA Final Rule.\39\ In 2001, the OCC, the 
Board, the FDIC, and the Office of Thrift Supervision (OTS) published 
joint rules to implement the CRA sunshine requirements of section 48 of 
the Federal Deposit Insurance Act, which were contained in section 711 
of the Gramm-Leach-Bliley Act.\40\ This statute requires 
nongovernmental entities or persons, insured depository institutions, 
and affiliates of insured depository institutions that are parties to 
certain agreements in fulfillment of the CRA to make the agreements 
available to the public and the appropriate agency and to file annual 
reports concerning the agreements with the appropriate agency. The CRA 
Sunshine regulations contain a number of cross-references to the 
agencies' CRA regulations.
---------------------------------------------------------------------------

    \38\ See 12 CFR parts 35 (OCC), 207 (Regulation G) (Board), and 
346 (FDIC).
    \39\ See 89 FR 6574, 6579 (Feb. 1, 2024) (explaining in footnote 
14 of the 2023 CRA Final Rule that the agencies would, at a later 
date, evaluate other rules that cross-reference to the CRA 
regulations to identify conforming changes that may be appropriate).
    \40\ See 66 FR 2052 (Jan. 10, 2001). Since this issuance, the 
OTS's CRA Sunshine regulation and its rulemaking authority for the 
CRA sunshine requirements for Federal savings associations 
transferred to the OCC pursuant to Title III of the Dodd-Frank Wall 
Street Reform and Consumer Protection Act, Public Law 111-203, 124 
Stat. 1376, 1522 (2010).
---------------------------------------------------------------------------

    In addition, the OCC is amending its Public Welfare Investment 
regulation, 12 CFR part 24, to update cross-references to its CRA 
regulation, 12 CFR part 25, to conform with changes made by the 2023 
CRA Final Rule.\41\ Part 24 currently provides that a national bank or 
national bank subsidiary may make an investment if the investment 
primarily benefits low- and moderate-income individuals, low- and 
moderate-income areas, or other areas targeted by a governmental entity 
for redevelopment, or the investment would receive consideration under 
12 CFR 25.23 as a ``qualified investment.''
---------------------------------------------------------------------------

    \41\ The Board's public welfare investment regulations do not 
cite to its CRA regulations, and thus do not need to be amended. See 
12 CFR 208.22. The FDIC does not have public welfare investment 
regulations.
---------------------------------------------------------------------------

    The conforming amendments to the agencies' CRA Sunshine regulations 
and the OCC's Public Welfare Investment regulation update the cross-
references from provisions in the agencies' legacy CRA regulations to 
reference the appropriate provisions in appendix G of the 2023 CRA 
Final Rule. As noted above, appendix G reproduces the agencies' legacy 
CRA regulations, which apply to banks until superseded by the 
provisions of the 2023 CRA Final Rule that become applicable on January 
1, 2026, or January 1, 2027. The agencies will update the cross-
references in the CRA Sunshine regulations again in the future to 
reflect the appropriate provisions in the 2023 CRA Final Rule prior to 
these future applicability dates.
    Technical amendment to 12 CFR part 192. The OCC regulations 
governing how a savings association may convert from mutual to stock 
form of ownership, 12 CFR part 192, currently include a cross-reference 
to the OCC's former CRA regulation for savings associations, 12 CFR 
part 195. The OCC integrated its CRA regulation for savings 
associations into 12 CFR part 25 and repealed part 195 in 2021.\42\ The 
OCC is updating this cross-reference, contained in 12 CFR

[[Page 22065]]

192.200(c), to now refer to 12 CFR part 25.
---------------------------------------------------------------------------

    \42\ See 86 FR 71328 (Dec. 15, 2021).
---------------------------------------------------------------------------

IV. Regulatory Analysis

Administrative Procedure Act

    The interim final rule and technical amendments are effective on 
April 1, 2024. The Administrative Procedure Act \43\ (APA) generally 
requires public notice and an opportunity for comment before a rule 
becomes effective.\44\ However, the APA provides that the notice-and-
comment requirements do not apply ``when the agency for good cause 
finds (and incorporates the finding and a brief statement of reasons 
therefor in the rules issued) that notice and public procedure thereon 
are impracticable, unnecessary, or contrary to the public interest.'' 
\45\
---------------------------------------------------------------------------

    \43\ 5 U.S.C. 551 et seq.
    \44\ See 5 U.S.C. 553(b)(A) and (B).
    \45\ 5 U.S.C. 553(b)(B).
---------------------------------------------------------------------------

    In addition, the APA requires that rules be published not less than 
30 days before their effective date.\46\ However, the APA provides that 
the requirement for a 30-day delay before the effective date of a rule 
does not apply: (1) for substantive rules which grant or recognize an 
exemption or relieve a restriction; (2) for interpretative rules and 
statements of policy; or (3) as otherwise provided by the agency ``for 
good cause found and published with the rule.'' \47\
---------------------------------------------------------------------------

    \46\ See 5 U.S.C. 553(d).
    \47\ 5 U.S.C. 553(d)(1)-(3).
---------------------------------------------------------------------------

    As described below, the agencies have determined that there is good 
cause for adopting the amendments in the interim final rule without 
advance notice and comment and with less than 30 days before its 
effective date, and for adopting the technical amendments as a final 
rule without notice and comment and with less than 30 days before its 
effective date.
    Interim final rule. The agencies have determined that advance 
public comment on the amendment to extend the applicability date of 
Sec.  __.16 (Facility-based assessment areas) and Sec.  __.43 (Content 
and availability of public file) of the 2023 CRA Final Rule to January 
1, 2026, is impracticable, unnecessary, or contrary to the public 
interest. Compared to the legacy CRA regulations, Sec.  __.16 requires 
certain changes to the requirements for delineating CRA assessment 
areas based on a bank's deposit-taking facilities,\48\ and Sec.  __.43 
similarly requires banks to make certain adjustments to comply with 
changes to the public file requirements.\49\ As discussed further in 
the SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION of this preamble, the agencies have 
determined that extending the applicability date of Sec. Sec.  __.16 
and __.43 to January 1, 2026, will facilitate bank understanding of, 
and compliance with, these provisions; allay potential uncertainty that 
may be associated with an April 1, 2024 applicability date; and further 
secure a stable transition from the agencies' legacy CRA regulations to 
the provisions of the 2023 CRA Final Rule, for the benefit of all 
stakeholders. To realize these benefits, the relief provided by this 
interim final rule is needed on or before April 1, 2024. Advance public 
comment would impede effectuation of the interim final rule in time to 
provide the necessary relief.
---------------------------------------------------------------------------

    \48\ See 89 FR 6728-6735 (Feb. 1, 2024).
    \49\ See 89 FR 7082-7085 (Feb. 1, 2024).
---------------------------------------------------------------------------

    For the reasons stated above, the agencies also find good cause for 
this amendment to be effective less than 30 days after publication in 
the Federal Register, on April 1, 2024. In particular, the agencies 
note both the time-sensitive nature of providing the relief, with the 
applicability date of Sec. Sec.  __.16 and __.43 otherwise being April 
1, 2024, but also that, consistent with another enumerated exception 
from APA timing requirements noted above, the amendment provides relief 
from new requirements in Sec. Sec.  __.16 and __.43.\50\
---------------------------------------------------------------------------

    \50\ See 5 U.S.C. 553(d)(1) and (3).
---------------------------------------------------------------------------

    While the agencies believe that there is good cause to issue this 
interim final rule without advance notice and comment and with an 
effective date of April 1, 2024, the agencies are interested in the 
views of the public and request comment on moving the applicability 
date of Sec. Sec.  __.16 and __.43 from April 1, 2024, to January 1, 
2026.
    Technical amendments. As explained further in the SUPPLEMENTARY 
INFORMATION of this preamble, the amendment to add Sec.  __.44 (Public 
notice) to the provisions that will apply on January 1, 2026, is a 
technical amendment with no substantive effect. Amending the 
applicability date for the public notice provision facilitates 
compliance by clarifying that banks may continue to use the CRA Notice 
in the agencies' legacy CRA regulations \51\ until appendix F becomes 
applicable on January 1, 2026. The agencies therefore find that public 
comment regarding this amendment is impracticable, unnecessary, or 
contrary to the public interest. For the same reasons, the agencies 
also find good cause for an exception to the APA 30-day notice 
requirement. Providing that this amendment takes effect on April 1, 
2024, clarifies the application of these provisions and ensures that 
banks have timely certainty of the CRA Notice form they may use as of 
the 2023 CRA Final Rule's April 1, 2024, effective date.
---------------------------------------------------------------------------

    \51\ See appendix B to the agencies' legacy CRA regulations in 
appendix G of the 2023 CRA Final Rule.
---------------------------------------------------------------------------

    The technical amendments to the bank asset-size thresholds in the 
Board's and the FDIC's appendix G of the 2023 CRA Final Rule update 
these thresholds to reflect subsequent amendments to the thresholds, so 
that the Board's and FDIC's appendix G remains consistent with the 
legacy CRA regulations, as intended. The Board and the FDIC issued 
these amendments through a final rule published in the Federal Register 
after they approved the 2023 CRA Final Rule.\52\ Accordingly, the Board 
and the FDIC find good cause for an exemption from the APA's public 
notice and comment procedures because public comment regarding these 
amendments is unnecessary. In addition, the agencies find that good 
cause exists for these amendments to be effective less than 30 days 
after publication in the Federal Register because the thresholds in 
appendix G of the Board's and the FDIC's CRA regulations will be 
immediately inaccurate as of April 1, 2024, absent the amendments in 
this final rule.
---------------------------------------------------------------------------

    \52\ See 88 FR 87895 (Dec. 20, 2023).
---------------------------------------------------------------------------

    The technical amendments that update cross-references in the 
agencies' CRA Sunshine regulations and the OCC's Public Welfare 
Investment regulation correct citations that will be inaccurate as of 
April 1, 2024, when the 2023 CRA Final Rule is effective, and do not 
change the substance or meaning of the affected regulations. The 
agencies accordingly find good cause for an exemption from the APA's 
public notice and comment procedures because public comment regarding 
these amendments is unnecessary. In addition, the agencies find that 
good cause exists for these amendments to be effective less than 30 
days after publication in the Federal Register because the citations of 
the affected regulations will be immediately inaccurate as of April 1, 
2024, absent the amendments in this final rule. Similarly, the OCC's 
amendment to its conversions from mutual to stock form regulation 
corrects an outdated cross-reference and has no substantive effect. 
Therefore, the OCC finds good cause for an exemption from the APA's 
public notice and comment provision and the 30-day effective date 
provision because public comment and a delayed effective

[[Page 22066]]

date on this amendment are unnecessary.

Congressional Review Act

    For purposes of the Congressional Review Act,\53\ the Office of 
Management and Budget (OMB) makes a determination as to whether a final 
rule constitutes a ``major rule.'' If a rule is deemed a ``major rule'' 
by the OMB, the Congressional Review Act generally provides that the 
rule may not take effect until at least 60 days following its 
publication. The Congressional Review Act defines a ``major rule'' as 
any rule that the Administrator of the Office of Information and 
Regulatory Affairs of the OMB finds has resulted in or is likely to 
result in--(1) an annual effect on the economy of $100 million or more; 
(2) a major increase in costs or prices for consumers, individual 
industries, Federal, State, or local government agencies, or geographic 
regions; or (3) significant adverse effects on competition, employment, 
investment, productivity, innovation, or on the ability of United 
States-based enterprises to compete with foreign-based enterprises in 
domestic and export markets.\54\ The agencies will submit the interim 
final rule and technical amendments to the OMB for this major rule 
determination. As required by the Congressional Review Act, the 
agencies will submit the appropriate report to Congress and the 
Government Accountability Office for review.\55\
---------------------------------------------------------------------------

    \55\ See 5 U.S.C. 801(a)(1).
---------------------------------------------------------------------------

Paperwork Reduction Act

    The Paperwork Reduction Act of 1995 \56\ states that no agency may 
conduct or sponsor, nor is the respondent required to respond to, an 
information collection unless it displays a currently valid OMB control 
number. The agencies have determined that the interim final rule and 
technical amendments do not create any new, or revise any existing, 
collections of information pursuant to the Paperwork Reduction Act.
---------------------------------------------------------------------------

    \56\ 44 U.S.C. 3501-3521.
---------------------------------------------------------------------------

Regulatory Flexibility Act

    Under the Regulatory Flexibility Act (RFA),\57\ an agency must 
consider the impact of its rules on small entities. Specifically, 
section 3 of the RFA requires an agency to provide a final regulatory 
flexibility analysis with a final rule unless the head of the agency 
certifies that the rule will not have a significant economic impact on 
a substantial number of small entities \58\ and publishes this 
certification and a statement of its factual basis in the Federal 
Register. However, the RFA does not apply to a rulemaking when a 
general notice of proposed rulemaking is not required.\59\ As described 
above, the agencies have determined that they are not required to 
publish a general notice of proposed rulemaking for the interim final 
rule or for the technical amendments. Accordingly, the RFA's 
requirements relating to an initial and final regulatory flexibility 
analysis do not apply.
---------------------------------------------------------------------------

    \57\ 5 U.S.C. 601 et seq.
    \58\ Small Business Administration regulations currently define 
small entities to include banks and savings associations with total 
assets of $850 million or less, and trust banks with total assets of 
$47.0 million or less. See 13 CFR 121.201, Section 52--Finance and 
Insurance, Subsectors 522 (Credit Intermediation and Related 
Activities) and 523 (Securities, Commodity Contracts, and Other 
Financial Investments and Related Activities).
    \59\ See 5 U.S.C. 603 and 604.

Riegle Community Development and Regulatory Improvement Act of 1994

    Pursuant to section 302(a) of the Riegle Community Development and 
Regulatory Improvement Act of 1994 (RCDRIA),\60\ in determining the 
effective date and administrative compliance requirements for new 
regulations that impose additional reporting, disclosure, or other 
requirements on insured depository institutions, an agency must 
consider, consistent with principles of safety and soundness and the 
public interest: (1) any administrative burdens that the rule will 
place on depository institutions, including small depository 
institutions and customers of depository institutions; and (2) the 
benefits of the rule.
---------------------------------------------------------------------------

    \60\ 12 U.S.C. 4802(a).
---------------------------------------------------------------------------

    Section 302(b) of RCDRIA \61\ provides that new regulations and 
amendments to regulations prescribed by a Federal banking agency which 
impose additional reporting, disclosures, or other new requirements on 
insured depository institutions must generally take effect on the first 
day of a calendar quarter which begins on or after the date on which 
the regulations are published in final form.
---------------------------------------------------------------------------

    \61\ 12 U.S.C. 4802(b).
---------------------------------------------------------------------------

    The interim final rule and technical amendments do not impose any 
additional reporting, disclosure, or other new requirements. Instead, 
the interim final rule extends the applicability date of the 2023 CRA 
Final Rule's facility-based assessment areas provision and public file 
provision, while the technical amendments make non-substantive changes 
to the agencies' CRA regulations, the agencies' CRA Sunshine 
regulations, the OCC's Public Welfare Investment regulation, and the 
OCC's mutual to stock conversion regulation. Therefore, subsections (a) 
and (b) of section 302 of RCDRIA are not applicable to this rulemaking 
action. However, the amendments made by this rulemaking action are 
effective on April 1, 2024, which is the first date of a calendar 
quarter.

Plain Language

    Section 722(a) of the Gramm-Leach-Bliley Act \62\ requires each 
Federal banking agency to use plain language in its proposed and final 
rulemakings. In this document, the agencies use plain language.

    As a general matter, the UMRA \63\ requires the OCC to prepare a 
budgetary impact statement before promulgating a rule that includes a 
Federal mandate that may result in the expenditure by State, local, and 
tribal governments, in the aggregate, or by the private sector, of $100 
million or more (adjusted annually for inflation and currently $182 
million) in any one year. However, the UMRA does not apply to final 
rules for which a general notice of proposed rulemaking was not 
published.\64\ As described above, the OCC has found good cause for an 
exception to the APA's notice and comment for the interim final rule 
and technical amendments. Therefore, the OCC has not prepared an 
economic analysis of the rule under the UMRA.

V. Federal Register Correction

    The OCC is making a correction to its UMRA discussion in the 
preamble to the 2023 CRA Final Rule (RIN 1557-AF15). This correction 
clarifies the OCC's expenditure estimates in consideration of the 2023 
CRA Final Rule transition provisions.

Correction

    In rule document 2023-25797 at 89 FR 6574 in the issue of February 
1, 2024, on page 7106, in the second column, the second paragraph that 
carries over to the third column is corrected to read as follows:

    Were the final rule to require full compliance within the first 
12 months of the transition period, the OCC estimates that 
expenditures to comply with mandates during those twelve months 
would not exceed approximately $91.8 million (approximately $7.9 
million associated with increased data collection, recordkeeping or 
reporting; $82 million for large banks to collect, maintain, and 
report annually

[[Page 22067]]

geographic data on deposits; and $1.9 million for banks' strategic 
plan submissions).\1644\ Under the final rule transition provisions, 
banks have longer than one year, until January 1, 2026, for most 
substantive provisions, and January 1, 2027, for the reporting 
requirements, to fully comply with the rule. Therefore, the OCC 
concludes that the final rule will not result in an expenditure by 
State, local, and tribal governments, in the aggregate, or by the 
private sector of $100 million or more (adjusted for inflation and 
currently $182 million annually) in any one year. Accordingly, the 
OCC has not prepared the budgetary impact statement.
* * * * *
    \1644\ Several commenters addressed the OCC's UMRA analysis of 
the proposed rule. Some of these commenters stated that the agency 
underestimated burden of the proposed rule, and others noted that 
the OCC provided insufficient information about its actual 
calculations. In drafting the final rule, the OCC considered these 
comments and made changes from the proposal where appropriate.
