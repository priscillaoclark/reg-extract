    General Description of Collection: FIRREA directs the FDIC to 
prescribe appropriate performance standards for real estate appraisals 
connected with federally related transactions under its jurisdiction. 
This information collection is a direct consequence of the statutory 
requirement. It is designed to provide protection for federal financial 
and public policy interests by requiring real estate appraisals used in 
connection with federally related transactions to be performed in 
writing, in accordance with uniform standards, by an appraiser whose 
competency has been demonstrated and whose professional conduct will be 
subject to effective supervision. There is no change in the methodology 
or substance of this information collection. The increase in estimated 
annual burden (from 227 hours in 2021 to 250 hours currently) is due to 
the increase in the estimated number of responses.

Request for Comment

    Comments are invited on: (a) Whether the collections of information 
are necessary for the proper performance of the FDIC's functions, 
including whether the information has practical utility; (b) the 
accuracy of the estimates of the burden of the information collections, 
including the validity of the methodology and assumptions used; (c) 
ways to enhance the quality, utility, and clarity of the information to 
be collected; and (d) ways to minimize the burden of the collections of 
information on respondents, including through the use of automated 
collection techniques or other forms of information technology. All 
comments will become a matter of public record.

Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation.

    Dated at Washington, DC, March 15, 2024.
James P. Sheesley,
Assistant Executive Secretary.
