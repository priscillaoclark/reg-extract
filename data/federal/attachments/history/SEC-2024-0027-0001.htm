SECURITIES AND EXCHANGE COMMISSION

[Release Nos. 33-11263; 34-99276; IA-6521; IC-35085]


Adjustments to Civil Monetary Penalty Amounts

AGENCY: Securities and Exchange Commission.

ACTION: Notice of annual inflation adjustment of civil monetary 
penalties.

-----------------------------------------------------------------------

SUMMARY: The Securities and Exchange Commission (``Commission'') is 
publishing this notice (``Notice'') pursuant to the Federal Civil 
Penalties Inflation Adjustment Act Improvements Act of 2015 (``2015 
Act''). This Act requires all agencies to annually adjust for inflation 
the civil monetary penalties that can be imposed under the statutes 
administered by the agency and publish the adjusted amounts in the 
Federal Register. This Notice sets forth the annual inflation 
adjustment of the maximum amount of civil monetary penalties (``CMPs'') 
administered by the Commission under the Securities Act of 1933, the 
Securities Exchange Act of 1934 (``Exchange Act''), the Investment 
Company Act of 1940, the Investment Advisers Act of 1940, and certain 
penalties under the Sarbanes-Oxley Act of 2002. These amounts are 
effective beginning on January 15, 2024, and will apply to all 
penalties imposed after that date for violations of the aforementioned 
statutes that occurred after November 2, 2015.

FOR FURTHER INFORMATION CONTACT: Stephen M. Ng, Senior Special Counsel, 
Office of the General Counsel, at (202) 551-7957, or Hannah W. Riedel, 
Senior Counsel, Office of the General Counsel, at (202) 551-7918.

SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION:

I. Background

    This Notice is being published pursuant to the 2015 Act,\1\ which 
amended the Federal Civil Penalties Inflation Adjustment Act of 1990 
(``Inflation Adjustment Act'').\2\ The Inflation Adjustment Act 
previously had been amended by the Debt Collection Improvement Act of 
1996 (``DCIA'') \3\ to require that each Federal agency adopt 
regulations at least once every four years that adjust for inflation 
the CMPs that can be imposed under the statutes administered by the 
agency. Pursuant to this requirement, the Commission previously adopted 
regulations in 1996, 2001, 2005, 2009, and 2013 to adjust the maximum 
amount of the CMPs that could be imposed under the statutes the 
Commission administers.\4\

---------------------------------------------------------------------------

    The 2015 Act replaces the inflation adjustment formula prescribed 
in the DCIA with a new formula for calculating the inflation-adjusted 
amount of CMPs. The 2015 Act requires that agencies use this new 
formula to re-calculate the inflation-adjusted amounts of the penalties 
they administer on an annual basis and publish these new amounts in

[[Page 1971]]

the Federal Register by January 15 of each year.\5\ The Commission 
previously published the first annual adjustment required by the 2015 
Act on January 6, 2017 (``2017 Adjustment'').\6\ As part of the 2017 
Adjustment, the Commission promulgated 17 CFR 201.1001(a) and Table I 
to Sec.  201.1001, which lists the penalty amounts for all violations 
that occurred on or before November 2, 2015. For violations occurring 
after November 2, 2015, Sec.  201.1001(b) provides that the applicable 
penalty amounts will be adjusted annually based on the formula set 
forth in the 2015 Act. Section 201.1001(b) further provides that these 
adjusted amounts will be published in the Federal Register and on the 
Commission's website. The Commission published the two most recent 
annual adjustments on January 6, 2022 (``2022 Adjustment''),\7\ and 
January 6, 2023 (``2023 Adjustment'').\8\

    A CMP is defined in relevant part as any penalty, fine, or other 
sanction that: (1) is for a specific amount, or has a maximum amount, 
as provided by Federal law; and (2) is assessed or enforced by an 
agency in an administrative proceeding or by a Federal court pursuant 
to Federal law.\9\ This definition applies to the monetary penalty 
provisions contained in four statutes administered by the Commission: 
the Securities Act, the Exchange Act, the Investment Company Act, and 
the Investment Advisers Act. In addition, the Sarbanes-Oxley Act 
provides the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (``PCAOB'') 
authority to levy civil monetary penalties in its disciplinary 
proceedings pursuant to 15 U.S.C. 7215(c)(4)(D).\10\ The definition of 
a CMP in the Inflation Adjustment Act encompasses such civil monetary 
penalties.\11\

    \10\ 15 U.S.C. 7215(c)(4)(D).
    \11\ The Commission may by order affirm, modify, remand, or set 
aside sanctions, including civil monetary penalties, imposed by the 
PCAOB. See section 107(c) of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act of 2002, 15 
U.S.C. 7217. The Commission may enforce such orders in Federal 
district court pursuant to section 21(e) of the Exchange Act. As a 
result, penalties assessed by the PCAOB in its disciplinary 
proceedings are penalties ``enforced'' by the Commission for 
purposes of the Inflation Adjustment Act. See Adjustments to Civil 
Monetary Penalty Amounts, Release No. 33-8530 (Feb. 4, 2005) [70 FR 
7606 (Feb. 14, 2005)].

II. Adjusting the Commission's Penalty Amounts for Inflation

    This Notice sets forth the annual inflation adjustment required by 
the 2015 Act for all CMPs under the Securities Act, the Exchange Act, 
the Investment Company Act, and the Investment Advisers Act, and 
certain civil monetary penalties under the Sarbanes-Oxley Act.
    Pursuant to the 2015 Act, the penalty amounts in the 2024 
Adjustment are adjusted for inflation by increasing them by the 
percentage change between the Consumer Price Index for all Urban 
Consumers (``CPI-U'') for October 2022 and the October 2023 CPI-U.\12\ 
OMB has provided its calculation of this multiplier (``CPI-U 
Multiplier'') to agencies.\13\ The new penalty amounts are determined 
by multiplying the amounts in the 2024 Adjustment by the CPI-U 
Multiplier and then rounding to the nearest dollar.
---------------------------------------------------------------------------

    \12\ 28 U.S.C. 2461 note Sec. 5.
    \13\ Office of Management and Budget, Implementation of Penalty 
Inflation Adjustments for 2024, Pursuant to the Federal Civil 
Penalties Inflation Adjustment Act Improvements Act of 2015 (Dec. 
19, 2023), available at <a href="https://www.whitehouse.gov/wp-content/uploads/2023/12/M-24-07-Implementation-of-Penalty-Inflation-Adjustments-for-2024.pdf">https://www.whitehouse.gov/wp-content/uploads/2023/12/M-24-07-Implementation-of-Penalty-Inflation-Adjustments-for-2024.pdf</a>. This multiplier represents the percentage 
increase between the Oct. 2022 CPI-U and the Oct. 2023 CPI-U, plus 
1.
---------------------------------------------------------------------------

    For example, the CMP for certain insider trading violations by 
controlling persons under Exchange Act section 21A(a)(3) \14\ was 
readjusted for inflation as part of the 2023 Adjustment to $2,479,282. 
To determine the new CMP under this provision, the Commission 
multiplies this amount by the CPI-U Multiplier of 1.03241, and rounds 
to the nearest dollar. Thus, the new CMP for Exchange Act section 
21A(a)(3) is $2,559,636.

recommendation that this Notice is not a ``major rule'' as defined by 
section 251 of the Small Business Regulatory Enforcement Fairness Act 
(``SBREFA''), 5 U.S.C. 804(2), because (1) it will not have an annual 
effect of $100 million dollars or more on the economy, (2) it does not 
present a major increase in prices for consumers or individual 
industries, and (3) it does not have significant adverse effects on 
competition, investment, or innovation.\17\
