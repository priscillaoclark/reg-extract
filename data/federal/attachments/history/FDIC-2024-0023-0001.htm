MATTERS TO BE CONSIDERED: The Special Review Committee of the Federal 
Deposit Insurance Corporation met to consider matters related to the

require consideration of the matters in a meeting open to public 
observation; and that the matters could be considered in a closed 
meeting by authority of subsections (c)(2) and (c)(6) of the 
``Government in the Sunshine Act'' (5 U.S.C. 552b (c)(2) and (c)(6)).
