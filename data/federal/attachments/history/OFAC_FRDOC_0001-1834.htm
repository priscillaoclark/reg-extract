ACTION: Final rule.

-----------------------------------------------------------------------

SUMMARY: The Department of the Treasury's Office of Foreign Assets

Sanctions Regulations and reissuing them in their entirety to further 
implement the Global Magnitsky Human Rights Accountability Act and a 
December 20, 2017 Executive Order related to human rights and 
corruption. This final rule replaces the regulations that were

Background

    On June 29, 2018, OFAC issued the Global Magnitsky Sanctions 
Regulations, 31 CFR part 583 (83 FR 30541, June 29, 2018) (the 
``Regulations''), to implement the Global Magnitsky Human Rights 
Accountability Act (22 U.S.C. 10101-10103 (the ``Global Magnitsky 
Act'')) and Executive Order (E.O.) 13818 of December 20, 2017, 
``Blocking the Property of Persons Involved in Serious Human Rights 
Abuse or Corruption'' (82 FR 60839, December 26, 2017), pursuant to 
authorities delegated to the Secretary of the Treasury. The Regulations 
were initially issued in abbreviated form for the purpose of providing 
immediate guidance to the public. OFAC is revising the Regulations to 
further implement the Global Magnitsky Act and E.O. 13818. OFAC is 
amending and reissuing the Regulations as a more comprehensive set of 
regulations that includes additional interpretive guidance and 
definitions, general licenses, and other regulatory provisions that 
will provide further guidance to the public. Finally, OFAC is adding 
the Uyghur Human Rights Policy Act of 2020, as amended, (22 U.S.C. 6901 
note; Pub. L. 116-145, 134 Stat. 648) to the authority citation of 31 
CFR part 583. Due to the number of regulatory sections being updated or 
added, OFAC is reissuing the Regulations in their entirety.

Global Magnitsky Act

    On December 23, 2016, the President signed the Global Magnitsky Act 
into law. The Global Magnitsky Act, in section 1263 (22 U.S.C. 10102), 
authorizes the President to impose targeted sanctions on any foreign 
person the President determines, based on credible evidence: (1) is 
responsible for extrajudicial killings, torture, or other gross 
violations of internationally recognized human rights committed against 
individuals in any foreign country who seek (A) to expose illegal 
activity carried out by government officials; or (B) to obtain, 
exercise, defend, or promote internationally recognized human rights 
and freedoms, such as the freedoms of religion, expression, 
association, and assembly, and the rights to a fair trial and 
democratic elections; (2) acted as an agent of or on behalf of foreign 
persons in a matter related to an activity described in (1); (3) is a 
government official, or a senior associate of such an official, that is 
responsible for, or complicit in, ordering, controlling, or otherwise 
directing, acts of significant corruption including the expropriation 
of private or public assets for personal gain, corruption related to 
government contracts or the extraction of natural resources, bribery, 
or the facilitation or transfer of the proceeds of corruption to 
foreign jurisdictions; or (4) has materially assisted, sponsored, or 
provided financial, material, or technological support for, or goods or 
services in support of, an activity described in (3).
    On September 8, 2017, the President delegated authority to the 
Secretary of the Treasury, in coordination with the Secretary of State, 
to administer the financial sanctions under section 1263 of the Global 
Magnitsky Act (22 U.S.C. 10102), which provides for the blocking of all 
property and interests in property of a foreign person described in 
section 1263(a) of the Global Magnitsky Act if such property and 
interests in property are in the United States, come within the United 
States, or are or come within the possession of or control of a United 
States person (82 FR 45411, September 28, 2017).
E.O. 13818
    On December 20, 2017, the President, invoking the authority of, 
inter alia, the International Emergency Economic Powers Act (50 U.S.C. 
1701 et seq.) (IEEPA) and the Global Magnitsky Act, issued E.O. 13818, 
effective at 12:01 a.m. eastern standard time on December 21, 2017, to 
implement and build upon the Global Magnitsky Act. In E.O. 13818, the 
President found that the prevalence and severity of human rights abuse 
and corruption that have their source, in whole or in substantial part, 
outside the United States, such as those committed or directed by 
persons listed in the Annex to E.O. 13818, have reached such scope and 
gravity that they threaten the stability of international political and 
economic systems. The President determined that serious human rights 
abuse and corruption around the world constitute an unusual and 
extraordinary threat to the national security, foreign policy, and 
economy of the United States and declared a national emergency to deal 
with that threat.
    Section 1(a) of E.O. 13818 blocks, with certain exceptions, all 
property and interests in property that are in the United States, that 
come within the United States, or that are or come within the 
possession or control of any U.S. person of: (i) the persons listed in 
the Annex to E.O. 13818; (ii) any foreign person determined by the 
Secretary of the Treasury, in consultation with the Secretary of State 
and the Attorney General: (A) to be responsible for or complicit in, or 
to have directly or indirectly engaged in, serious human rights abuse; 
(B) to be a current or former government official, or a person acting 
for or on behalf of such an official, who is responsible for or 
complicit in, or has directly or indirectly engaged in: (1) corruption, 
including the misappropriation of state assets, the expropriation of 
private assets for personal gain, corruption related to government 
contracts or the extraction of natural resources, or bribery; or (2) 
the transfer or the facilitation of the transfer of the proceeds of 
corruption; (C) to be or have been a leader or official of: (1) an 
entity, including any government entity, that has engaged in, or whose 
members have engaged in, any of the activities described in subsection 
1(ii)(A), (B)(1), or (B)(2) of E.O. 13818 relating to the leader's or 
official's tenure; or (2) an entity whose property and interests in 
property are blocked pursuant to this order as a result of activities 
related to the leader's or official's tenure; (D) to have attempted to 
engage in any of the activities described in subsection 1(ii)(A), 
(B)(1), or (B)(2) of E.O. 13818; and (iii) any person determined by the 
Secretary of the Treasury, in consultation with the Secretary of State 
and the Attorney General: (A) to have materially assisted, sponsored, 
or provided financial, material, or technological support for, or goods 
or services to or in support of: (1) any activity described in 
subsection 1(ii)(A), (B)(1), or (B)(2) of E.O. 13818 that is conducted 
by a foreign person; (2) any person whose property and interests in 
property are blocked pursuant to E.O. 13818; or (3) any entity, 
including any government entity, that has engaged in, or whose members 
have engaged in, any of the activities described in subsection 
1(ii)(A), (B)(1), or (B)(2) of E.O. 13818, where the activity is 
conducted by a foreign person; (B) to be owned or controlled by, or to 
have acted or purported to act for or on behalf of, directly or 
indirectly, any person whose property and interests in property are 
blocked pursuant to this order; or (C) to have attempted to engage in 
any of the

[[Page 17730]]

activities described in subsection 1(iii)(A) or (B) of E.O. 13818. The 
property and interests in property that are in the United States, that 
come within the United States, or that are or come within the 
possession or control of any United States person, of the persons 
described above may not be transferred, paid, exported, withdrawn, or 
otherwise dealt in.
    Section 1(b) of E.O. 13818 provides that the prohibitions in 
Section 1(a) of E.O. 13818 apply except to the extent provided by 
statutes, or in regulations, orders, directives, or licenses that may 
be issued pursuant to E.O. 13818, and notwithstanding any contract 
entered into or any license or permit granted before the effective date 
of E.O. 13818.
    In Section 3 of E.O. 13818, the President determined that the 
making of donations of the types of articles specified in section 
203(b)(2) of IEEPA (50 U.S.C. 1702(b)(2)), by, to, or for the benefit 
of any person whose property and interests in property are blocked 
pursuant to E.O. 13818 would seriously impair the President's ability 
to deal with the national emergency declared in E.O. 13818. The 
President therefore prohibited the donation of such items except to the 
extent provided by statutes, or in regulations, rulings, instructions, 
orders, directives, or licenses that may be issued pursuant to E.O. 
13818.
    Section 4 of E.O. 13818 provides that the prohibition on any 
transaction or dealing in blocked property or interests in property 
includes the making of any contribution or provision of funds, goods, 
or services by, to, or for the benefit of any person whose property and 
interests in property are blocked pursuant to E.O. 13818, and the 
receipt of any contribution or provision of funds, goods, or services 
from any such person.
    Section 5 of E.O. 13818 prohibits any transaction that evades or 
avoids, has the purpose of evading or avoiding, causes a violation of, 
or attempts to violate any of the prohibitions set forth in E.O. 13818, 
as well as any conspiracy formed to violate such prohibitions.
    Section 8 of E.O. 13818 authorizes the Secretary of the Treasury, 
in consultation with the Secretary of State, to take such actions, 
including adopting rules and regulations, and to employ all powers 
granted to the President by IEEPA and the Global Magnitsky Act, as may 
be necessary to implement E.O. 13818 and section 1263(a) of the Global 
Magnitsky Act (22 U.S.C. 10102(a)). Section 8 of E.O. 13818 also 
provides that the Secretary of the Treasury may redelegate any of these 
functions to other officers and agencies of the United States.

Current Regulatory Action

    To further implement the Global Magnitsky Act and E.O. 13818, OFAC 
is amending and reissuing the Regulations. The Regulations implement 
targeted sanctions that are directed at persons determined to meet the 
criteria set forth in Sec.  583.201(a) of the Regulations, as well as 
sanctions that may be set forth in any further Executive orders issued 
pursuant to the national emergency declared in E.O. 13818. The 
sanctions in E.O. 13818 do not generally prohibit trade or the 
provision of banking or other financial services to a certain country. 
Instead, the sanctions in E.O. 13818 apply where the transaction or 
service in question involves property or interests in property that are 
blocked pursuant to these authorities.
    Subpart A of the Regulations clarifies the relation of this part to 
other laws and regulations. Subpart B of the Regulations implements the 
prohibitions contained in sections 1, 3, 4, and 5 of E.O. 13818, which 
implement and build upon the prohibitions set forth in the Global 
Magnitsky Act, the prohibitions contained in any further Executive 
orders issued pursuant to the national emergency declared in E.O. 
13818. Persons identified in the Annex to E.O. 13818, designated by or 
under the authority of the Secretary of the Treasury pursuant to E.O. 
13818, or otherwise blocked pursuant to E.O. 13818, as well as persons 
who are blocked pursuant to any further Executive orders issued 
pursuant to the national emergency declared in E.O. 13818, are referred 
to throughout the Regulations as ``persons whose property and interests 
in property are blocked pursuant to Sec.  583.201.'' The names of 
persons designated or identified as blocked pursuant to E.O. 13818, or 
any further Executive orders issued pursuant to the national emergency 
declared therein, are published on OFAC's SDN List, which is accessible 
via OFAC's website. Those names also are published in the Federal 
Register as they are added to the SDN List.
    Sections 583.202 and 583.203 of subpart B detail the effect of 
transfers of blocked property in violation of the Regulations and set 
forth the requirement to hold blocked funds, such as currency, bank 
deposits, or liquidated financial obligations, in interest-bearing 
blocked accounts. Section 583.204 of subpart B provides that all 
expenses incident to the maintenance of blocked tangible property shall 
be the responsibility of the owners and operators of such property, and 
that such expenses shall not be met from blocked funds, unless 
otherwise authorized. The section further provides that blocked 
property may, in OFAC's discretion, be sold or liquidated and the net 
proceeds placed in a blocked interest-bearing account in the name of 
the owner of the property.
    Section 583.205 of subpart B prohibits any transaction that evades 
or avoids, has the purpose of evading or avoiding, causes a violation 
of, or attempts to violate any of the prohibitions set forth in section 
583.201 of the Regulations, and any conspiracy formed to violate such 
prohibitions.
    Section 583.206 of subpart B details transactions that are exempt 
from the prohibitions of the Regulations pursuant to section 203(b) of 
IEEPA (50 U.S.C. 1702(b)).
    In subpart D, which contains interpretive sections regarding the 
Regulations, certain provisions have been renumbered and others added 
to those in the prior abbreviated set of regulations. Section 583.411 
of subpart D explains that the property and interests in property of an 
entity are blocked if the entity is directly or indirectly owned, 
whether individually or in the aggregate, 50 percent or more by one or 
more persons whose property and interests in property are blocked, 
whether or not the entity itself is incorporated into OFAC's SDN List.
    Transactions otherwise prohibited by the Regulations but found to 
be consistent with U.S. policy may be authorized by one of the general 
licenses contained in or issued pursuant to subpart E of the 
Regulations or by a specific license issued pursuant to the procedures 
described in subpart E of 31 CFR part 501. General licenses and 
statements of licensing policy relating to this part also may be 
available through the Global Magnitsky sanctions page on OFAC's 
website: <a href="http://www.treas.gov/ofac">www.treas.gov/ofac</a>.
    Subpart F of the Regulations refers to subpart C of part 501 for 
recordkeeping and reporting requirements. Subpart G of the Regulations 
describes the civil and criminal penalties applicable to violations of 
the Regulations, as well as the procedures governing the potential 
imposition of a civil monetary penalty or issuance of a Finding of 
Violation. Subpart G also refers to appendix A of part 501 for a more 
complete description of these procedures.
    Subpart H of the Regulations refers to subpart E of part 501 for 
applicable provisions relating to administrative procedures and 
contains a delegation of certain authorities of the Secretary of the 
Treasury. Subpart I of the

[[Page 17731]]

Regulations sets forth a Paperwork Reduction Act notice.

Public Participation

    Because the Regulations involve a foreign affairs function, the 
provisions of E.O. 12866 of September 30, 1993, ``Regulatory Planning 
and Review'' (58 FR 51735, October 4, 1993), as amended, and the 
Administrative Procedure Act (5 U.S.C. 553) requiring notice of 
proposed rulemaking, opportunity for public participation, and delay in 
effective date are inapplicable. Because no notice of proposed 
rulemaking is required for this rule, the Regulatory Flexibility Act (5 
U.S.C. 601-612) does not apply.

Paperwork Reduction Act

    The collections of information related to the Regulations are 
contained in 31 CFR part 501 (the ``Reporting, Procedures and Penalties 
Regulations''). Pursuant to the Paperwork Reduction Act of 1995 (44 
U.S.C. 3507), those collections of information have been approved by 
the Office of Management and Budget under control number 1505-0164. An 
agency may not conduct or sponsor, and a person is not required to 
respond to, a collection of information unless the collection of 
information displays a valid control number.

List of Subjects in 31 CFR Part 583

    Administrative practice and procedure, Banks, Banking, Blocking of 
assets, Corruption, Credit, Foreign trade, Global Magnitsky, Human 
rights, Penalties, Reporting and recordkeeping requirements, Sanctions,

Sec.  583.101  Relation of this part to other laws and regulations.

    This part is separate from, and independent of, the other parts of 
this chapter, with the exception of part 501 of this chapter, the 
recordkeeping and reporting requirements and license application and 
other procedures of which apply to this part. Actions taken pursuant to 
part 501 of this chapter with respect to the prohibitions contained in 
this part are considered actions taken pursuant to this part. Differing 
foreign policy and national security circumstances may result in 
differing interpretations of similar language among the parts of this 
chapter. No license or authorization contained in or issued pursuant to 
those other parts authorizes any transaction prohibited by this part. 
No license or authorization contained in or issued pursuant to any 
other provision of law or regulation authorizes any transaction 
prohibited by this part. No license or authorization contained in or 
issued pursuant to this part relieves the involved parties from 
complying with any other applicable laws or regulations.


Sec.  583.102  Records and reports.

    For provisions relating to required records and reports, see part 
501, subpart C, of this chapter. Recordkeeping and reporting 
requirements imposed by part 501 of this chapter with respect to the 
prohibitions contained in this part are considered requirements arising 
pursuant to this part.

part.

    (a) Any transfer after the effective date that is in violation of 
any provision of this part or of any regulation, ruling, instruction, 
order, directive, or license issued pursuant to this part, and that 
involves any property or interest in property blocked pursuant to Sec.  
583.201, is null and void and shall not be the basis for the assertion 
or recognition of any interest in or right, remedy, power, or privilege 
with respect to such property or interest in property.
    (b) No transfer before the effective date shall be the basis for 
the assertion or recognition of any right, remedy, power, or privilege 
with respect to, or any interest in, any property or interest in 
property blocked pursuant to Sec.  583.201, unless the person who holds 
or maintains such property, prior to that date, had written notice of 
the transfer or by any written evidence had recognized such transfer.
    (c) Unless otherwise provided, a license or other authorization 
issued by OFAC before, during, or after a transfer shall validate such 
transfer or make it enforceable to the same extent that it would be 
valid or enforceable but for the provisions of this part and any 
regulation, ruling, instruction, order, directive, or license issued 
pursuant to this part.
    (d) Transfers of property that otherwise would be null and void or 
unenforceable by virtue of the provisions of this section shall not be 
deemed to be null and void or unenforceable as to any person with whom 
such property is or was held or maintained (and as to such person only) 
in cases in which such person is able to establish to the satisfaction 
of OFAC each of the following:
    (1) Such transfer did not represent a willful violation of the 
provisions of this part by the person with whom such property is or was 
held or maintained (and as to such person only);
    (2) The person with whom such property is or was held or maintained 
did not have reasonable cause to know or suspect, in view of all the 
facts and circumstances known or available to such person, that such 
transfer required a license or authorization issued pursuant to this 
part and was not so licensed or authorized, or, if a license or 
authorization did purport to cover the transfer, that such license or 
authorization had been obtained by misrepresentation of a third party 
or withholding of material facts or was otherwise fraudulently 
obtained; and
    (3) The person with whom such property is or was held or maintained 
filed with OFAC a report setting forth in full the circumstances 
relating to such transfer promptly upon discovery that:
    (i) Such transfer was in violation of the provisions of this part 
or any regulation, ruling, instruction, order, directive, license, or 
other authorization issued pursuant to this part;
    (ii) Such transfer was not licensed or authorized by OFAC; or
    (iii) If a license did purport to cover the transfer, such license 
had been obtained by misrepresentation of a third party or withholding 
of material facts or was otherwise fraudulently obtained.
    (e) The filing of a report in accordance with the provisions of 
paragraph (d)(3) of this section shall not be deemed evidence that the 
terms of paragraphs (d)(1) and (2) of this section have been satisfied.
    (f) Unless licensed pursuant to this part, any attachment, 
judgment, decree, lien, execution, garnishment, or other judicial 
process is null and void with respect to any property or interest in

funds, such as currency, bank deposits, or liquidated financial 
obligations, subject to Sec.  583.201 shall hold or place such funds in 
a blocked interest-bearing account located in the United States.
    (b)(1) For the purposes of this section, the term blocked interest-
bearing account means a blocked account:
    (i) In a federally insured U.S. bank, thrift institution, or credit 
union, provided the funds are earning interest at rates that are 
commercially reasonable; or

Exchange Commission under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 (15 
U.S.C. 78a et seq.), provided the funds are invested in a money market 
fund or in U.S. Treasury bills.
    (2) Funds held or placed in a blocked account pursuant to paragraph 
(a) of this section may not be invested in instruments the maturity of 
which exceeds 180 days.
    (c) For the purposes of this section, a rate is commercially 
reasonable if it is the rate currently offered to other depositors on 
deposits or instruments of comparable size and maturity.
    (d) For the purposes of this section, if interest is credited to a 
separate blocked account or subaccount, the name of the account party 
on each account must be the same.
    (e) Blocked funds held in instruments the maturity of which exceeds 
180 days at the time the funds become subject to Sec.  583.201 may 
continue to be held until maturity in the original instrument, provided 
any interest, earnings, or other proceeds derived therefrom are paid 
into a blocked interest-bearing account in accordance with paragraph 
(a) or (f) of this section.
    (f) Blocked funds held in accounts or instruments outside the 
United States at the time the funds become subject to Sec.  583.201 may 
continue to be held in the same type of accounts or instruments, 
provided the funds earn interest at rates that are commercially 
reasonable.
    (g) This section does not create an affirmative obligation for the 
holder of blocked tangible property, such as real or personal property, 
or of other blocked property, such as debt or equity securities, to 
sell or liquidate such property. However, OFAC may issue licenses 
permitting or directing such sales or liquidation in appropriate cases.
    (h) Funds blocked pursuant to Sec.  583.201 may not be held, 
invested, or reinvested in a manner that provides financial or economic 
benefit or access to any person whose property and interests in 
property are blocked pursuant to Sec.  583.201, nor may their holder 
cooperate in or facilitate the pledging or other attempted use as 
collateral of blocked funds or other assets.

shall be the responsibility of the owners or operators of such 
property, which expenses shall not be met from blocked funds.

directive, or license issued pursuant to this part is a reference to 
the same as currently amended unless otherwise so specified.

    Unless otherwise specifically provided, any amendment, 
modification, or revocation of any provision in or appendix to this 
part or chapter or of any regulation, ruling, insruction, order, 
directive, or license issued by OFAC does not affect any act done or 
omitted, or any civil or criminal proceeding commenced or pending, 
prior to such amendment, modification, or revocation. All penalties, 
forfeitures, and liabilities under any such regulation, ruling, 
instruction, order, directive, or license continue and may be enforced 
as if such amendment, modification, or revocation had not been made.


Sec.  583.403  Termination and acquisition of an interest in blocked 
property.

    (a) Whenever a transaction licensed or authorized by or pursuant to 
this part results in the transfer of property (including any property 
interest) away from a person whose property and interests in property 
are blocked pursuant to Sec.  583.201, such property shall no longer be 
deemed to be property blocked pursuant to Sec.  583.201, unless there 
exists in the property another interest that is blocked pursuant to 
Sec.  583.201, the transfer of which has not been effected pursuant to 
license or other authorization.
    (b) Unless otherwise specifically provided in a license or 
authorization issued pursuant to this part, if property (including any 
property interest) is transferred or attempted to be transferred to a 
person whose property and interests in property are blocked pursuant to 
Sec.  583.201, such property shall be deemed to be property in which 
such person has an interest and therefore blocked.


Sec.  583.404  Transactions ordinarily incident to a licensed 
transaction.

    (a) Any transaction ordinarily incident to a licensed transaction 
and necessary to give effect thereto is also authorized, except:
    (1) An ordinarily incident transaction, not explicitly authorized 
within the terms of the license, by or with a person whose property and 
interests in property are blocked pursuant to Sec.  583.201; or
    (2) An ordinarily incident transaction, not explicitly authorized 
within the terms of the license, involving a debit to a blocked account 
or a transfer of blocked property.
    (b) For example, a license authorizing a person to complete a 
securities sale involving Company A, whose property and interests in 
property are blocked pursuant to Sec.  583.201, also authorizes other 
persons to engage in activities that are ordinarily incident and 
necessary to complete the sale, including transactions by the buyer,

are not themselves persons whose property and interests in property are 
blocked pursuant to Sec.  583.201.


Sec.  583.405  Provision and receipt of services.

    (c) For example, U.S. persons may not, except as authorized by or

[[Page 17736]]

financial, brokering, freight forwarding, transportation, public 
relations, or other services to any person whose property and interests

property are blocked pursuant to Sec.  583.201.

prohibited.

    Pursuant to Sec.  583.201, no debits may be made to a blocked

authorized by or pursuant to this part.

    Note 1 to Sec.  583.407.  See also Sec.  583.502(e), which 
provides that no license or other authorization contained in or

or payment from blocked property or the debit to a blocked account.

Sec.  583.408  Charitable contributions.

    Unless specifically authorized by OFAC pursuant to this part, no 
charitable contribution of funds, goods, services, or technology,

clothing, or medicine, may be made by, to, or for the benefit of, or 
received from, a person whose property and interests in property are 
blocked pursuant to Sec.  583.201. For the purposes of this part, a 
contribution is made by, to, or for the benefit of, or received from a 
person whose property and interests in property are blocked pursuant to 
Sec.  583.201 if made by, to, or in the name of, or received from or in 
the name of, such a person; if made by, to, or in the name of, or 
received from or in the name of, an entity or individual acting for or 
on behalf of, or owned or controlled by, such a person; or if made in

receipt of contributions from such a person.


Sec.  583.409  Credit extended and cards issued by financial 
institutions to a person whose property and interests in property are

    The prohibition in Sec.  583.201 on dealing in property subject to

under any existing credit agreements, including charge cards, debit 
cards, or other credit facilities issued by a financial institution to 
a person whose property and interests in property are blocked pursuant 
to Sec.  583.201.


Sec.  583.410  Setoffs prohibited.

    A setoff against blocked property (including a blocked account), 
whether by a U.S. financial institution or other U.S. person, is a 
prohibited transfer under Sec.  583.201 if effected after the effective 
date.


Sec.  583.411  Entities owned by one or more persons whose property and 
interests in property are blocked.

pursuant to Sec.  583.201 have an interest in all property and 
interests in property of an entity in which such persons directly or 
indirectly own, whether individually or in the aggregate, a 50 percent 
or greater interest. The property and interests in property of such an 
entity, therefore, are blocked, and such an entity is a person whose 
property and interests in property are blocked pursuant to Sec.  
583.201, regardless of whether the name of the entity is incorporated 
into OFAC's Specially Designated Nationals and Blocked Persons List 
(SDN List).


Sec.  583.412  Entities of which one or more blocked persons is a 
member, leader, official, senior executive officer, or otherwise 
exercises control.

    (a) The property and interests in property of an entity, including 
any political subdivision, agency, or instrumentality of a governmental 
entity, are not blocked solely because one or more persons whose 
property and interests in property are blocked pursuant to Sec.  
583.201 is a member, leader, official, senior executive officer, or 
otherwise exercises control.

    Note 1 to paragraph (a).  See Sec.  583.411 concerning the 
blocked status of property and interests in property of an entity 
that is directly or indirectly owned, whether individually or in the 
aggregate, 50 percent or more by one or more persons whose property 
and interests in property are blocked pursuant to Sec.  583.201.
    (b) For example, U.S. persons may not, except as authorized or 
exempt pursuant to this part, engage in the following transactions 
with a person whose property and interests in property are blocked 
pursuant to Sec.  583.201: enter into contracts that are signed by a 
blocked person, enter into negotiations with a blocked person, or 
process transactions, directly or indirectly, on behalf of a person 
whose property and interests in property are blocked pursuant to 
Sec.  583.201. However, U.S. persons are not prohibited from 
engaging in a routine interaction with an agency in which a blocked 
person is an official, but which does not involve the blocked person 
directly or indirectly.


    Note 2 to Sec.  583.412.  OFAC encourages U.S. persons to be 
cautious in engaging in transactions with any entity of which a 
person whose property and interests in property are blocked pursuant 
to Sec.  583.201 is a member, leader, official, senior executive 
officer, or otherwise exercises control to ensure that U.S. persons 
are not engaged in transactions, directly or indirectly, with a 
blocked person, except as authorized or exempt pursuant to this 
part.

Subpart E--Licenses, Authorizations, and Statements of Licensing 
Policy


Sec.  583.501  General and specific licensing procedures.

    For provisions relating to licensing procedures, see part 501, 
subpart E, of this chapter. Licensing actions taken pursuant to part 
501 of this chapter with respect to the prohibitions contained in this 
part are considered actions taken pursuant to this part. General 
licenses and statements of licensing policy relating to this part also 
may be available through the Global Magnitsky sanctions page on OFAC's 
website: <a href="http://www.treas.gov/ofac">www.treas.gov/ofac</a>.


Sec.  583.502  Effect of license or other authorization.

    (a) No license or other authorization contained in this part, or 
otherwise issued by OFAC, authorizes or validates any transaction 
effected prior to the issuance of such license or other authorization, 
unless specifically provided in such license or authorization.
    (b) No regulation, ruling, instruction, order, directive, or 
license authorizes any transaction prohibited under this part unless 
the regulation, ruling, instruction, order, directive, or license is 
issued by OFAC and specifically refers to this part. No regulation, 
ruling, instruction, order, directive, or license referring to this 
part shall be deemed to authorize any transaction prohibited by any 
other part of this chapter unless the regulation, ruling, instruction, 
order, directive, or license specifically refers to such part.
    (c) Any regulation, ruling, instruction, order, directive, or 
license authorizing any transaction prohibited under this part has the 
effect of removing a prohibition contained in this part from the 
transaction, but only to the extent

[[Page 17737]]

specifically stated by its terms. Unless the regulation, ruling, 
instruction, order, directive, or license otherwise specifies, such an 
authorization does not create any right, duty, obligation, claim, or 
interest in, or with respect to, any property that would not otherwise 
exist under ordinary principles of law.
    (d) Nothing contained in this part shall be construed to supersede 
the requirements established under any other provision of law or to 
relieve a person from any requirement to obtain a license or other 
authorization from another department or agency of the U.S. government 
in compliance with applicable laws and regulations subject to the 
jurisdiction of that department or agency. For example, exports of 
goods, services, or technical data that are not prohibited by this part 
or that do not require a license by OFAC nevertheless may require 
authorization by the U.S. Department of Commerce, the U.S. Department 
of State, or other agencies of the U.S. government.
    (e) No license or other authorization contained in or issued 
pursuant to this part authorizes transfers of or payments from blocked 
property or debits to blocked accounts unless the license or other 
authorization explicitly authorizes the transfer of or payment from 
blocked property or the debit to a blocked account.
    (f) Any payment relating to a transaction authorized in or pursuant 
to this part that is routed through the U.S. financial system should 
reference the relevant OFAC general or specific license authorizing the 
payment to avoid the blocking or rejection of the transfer.


Sec.  583.503  Exclusion from licenses.

    OFAC reserves the right to exclude any person, property, 
transaction, or class thereof from the operation of any license or from 
the privileges conferred by any license. OFAC also reserves the right 
to restrict the applicability of any license to particular persons, 
property, transactions, or classes thereof. Such actions are binding 
upon actual or constructive notice of the exclusions or restrictions.


Sec.  583.504  Payments and transfers to blocked accounts in U.S. 
financial institutions.

    Any payment of funds or transfer of credit in which a person whose 
property and interests in property are blocked pursuant to Sec.  
583.201 has any interest that comes within the possession or control of 
a U.S. financial institution must be blocked in an account on the books 
of that financial institution. A transfer of funds or credit by a U.S. 
financial institution between blocked accounts in its branches or 
offices is authorized, provided that no transfer is made from an 
account within the United States to an account held outside the United 
States, and further provided that a transfer from a blocked account may 
be made only to another blocked account held in the same name.

    Note 1 to Sec.  583.504. See Sec.  501.603 of this chapter for 
mandatory reporting requirements regarding financial transfers. See 
also Sec.  583.203 concerning the obligation to hold blocked funds 
in interest-bearing accounts.

Sec.  583.505  Entries in certain accounts for normal service charges.

    (a) A U.S. financial institution is authorized to debit any blocked 
account held at that financial institution in payment or reimbursement 
for normal service charges owed it by the owner of that blocked 
account.
    (b) As used in this section, the term normal service charges shall 
include charges in payment or reimbursement for interest due; cable, 
telegraph, internet, or telephone charges; postage costs; custody fees; 
small adjustment charges to correct bookkeeping errors; and, but not by 
way of limitation, minimum balance charges, notary and protest fees, 
and charges for reference books, photocopies, credit reports, 
transcripts of statements, registered mail, insurance, stationery and 
supplies, and other similar items.


Sec.  583.506  Investment and reinvestment of certain funds.

    Subject to the requirements of Sec.  583.203, U.S. financial 
institutions are authorized to invest and reinvest assets blocked 
pursuant to Sec.  583.201, subject to the following conditions:
    (a) The assets representing such investments and reinvestments are 
credited to a blocked account or subaccount that is held in the same 
name at the same U.S. financial institution, or within the possession 
or control of a U.S. person, but funds shall not be transferred outside 
the United States for this purpose;
    (b) The proceeds of such investments and reinvestments shall not be 
credited to a blocked account or subaccount under any name or 
designation that differs from the name or designation of the specific 
blocked account or subaccount in which such funds or securities were 
held; and
    (c) No immediate financial or economic benefit accrues (e.g., 
through pledging or other use) to a person whose property and interests 
in property are blocked pursuant to Sec.  583.201.


Sec.  583.507  Provision of certain legal services.

    (a) The provision of the following legal services to or on behalf 
of persons whose property and interests in property are blocked 
pursuant to Sec.  583.201, is authorized, provided that any receipt of 
payment of professional fees and reimbursement of incurred expenses 
must be authorized pursuant to Sec.  583.508, which authorizes certain 
payments for legal services from funds originating outside the United 
States; via specific license; or otherwise pursuant to this part:
    (1) Provision of legal advice and counseling on the requirements of 
and compliance with the laws of the United States or any jurisdiction 
within the United States, provided that such advice and counseling are 
not provided to facilitate transactions in violation of this part;
    (2) Representation of persons named as defendants in or otherwise 
made parties to legal, arbitration, or administrative proceedings 
before any U.S. federal, state, or local court or agency;
    (3) Initiation and conduct of legal, arbitration, or administrative 
proceedings before any U.S. federal, state, or local court or agency;
    (4) Representation of persons before any U.S. federal, state, or 
local court or agency with respect to the imposition, administration, 
or enforcement of U.S. sanctions against such persons; and
    (5) Provision of legal services in any other context in which 
prevailing U.S. law requires access to legal counsel at public expense.
    (b) The provision of any other legal services to or on behalf of 
persons whose property and interests in property are blocked pursuant 
to Sec.  583.201, not otherwise authorized in this part, requires the 
issuance of a specific license.
    (c) U.S. persons do not need to obtain specific authorization to 
provide related services, such as making filings and providing other 
administrative services, that are ordinarily incident to the provision 
of services authorized by paragraph (a) of this section. Additionally, 
U.S. persons who provide services authorized by paragraph (a) of this 
section do not need to obtain specific authorization to contract for 
related services that are ordinarily incident to the provision of those 
legal services, such as those provided by private investigators or 
expert witnesses, or to pay for such services. See Sec.  583.404.
    (d) Entry into a settlement agreement or the enforcement of any 
lien, judgment, arbitral award, decree, or

[[Page 17738]]

other order through execution, garnishment, or other judicial process 
purporting to transfer or otherwise alter or affect property or 
interests in property blocked pursuant to Sec.  583.201 is prohibited 
unless licensed pursuant to this part.

    Note 1 to Sec.  583.507.  Pursuant to part 501, subpart E, of 
this chapter, U.S. persons seeking administrative reconsideration or 
judicial review of their designation or the blocking of their 
property and interests in property may apply for a specific license 
from OFAC to authorize the release of certain blocked funds for the 
payment of professional fees and reimbursement of incurred expenses 
for the provision of such legal services where alternative funding 
sources are not available.

Sec.  583.508  Payments for legal services from funds originating 
outside the United States.

    (a) Professional fees and incurred expenses. (1) Receipt of payment 
of professional fees and reimbursement of incurred expenses for the 
provision of legal services authorized pursuant to Sec.  583.507(a) to 
or on behalf of any person whose property and interests in property are 
blocked pursuant to Sec.  583.201 is authorized from funds originating 
outside the United States, provided that the funds do not originate 
from:
    (i) A source within the United States;
    (ii) Any source, wherever located, within the possession or control 
of a U.S. person; or
    (iii) Any individual or entity, other than the person on whose 
behalf the legal services authorized pursuant to Sec.  583.507(a) are 
to be provided, whose property and interests in property are blocked 
pursuant to any part of this chapter or any Executive order or statute.
    (2) Nothing in this paragraph (a) authorizes payments for legal 
services using funds in which any other person whose property and 
interests in property are blocked pursuant to Sec.  583.201, any other 
part of this chapter, or any Executive order or statute has an 
interest.
    (b) Records. Consistent with Sec.  501.601 of this chapter, U.S. 
persons who receive payments pursuant to paragraph (a) of this section 
must retain for five years from the date of the relevant payment a

services to the U.S. person receiving payment in connection with 
authorized legal services, such as private investigators or expert 
witnesses;
    (ii) A general description of the services provided; and
    (iii) The amount of funds paid in connection with such services.
    (3) These records must be furnished to OFAC on demand consistent

    (2) IEEPA provides for a maximum civil penalty not to exceed the 
greater of $368,136 or an amount that is twice the amount of the

the penalty is imposed.
    (3) A person who willfully commits, willfully attempts to commit, 
willfully conspires to commit, or aids or abets in the commission of a 
violation of any regulation in this part, ruling, instruction, order,

Sec.  583.702  Pre-Penalty Notice; settlement.

    (a) When required. If OFAC has reason to believe that there has 
occurred a violation of any provision of this part or a violation of 
the provisions of any regulation, ruling, instruction, order, 
directive, or license issued by or pursuant to the direction or 
authorization of the Secretary of the Treasury pursuant to this part or 
otherwise under the International Emergency Economic Powers Act (50 
U.S.C. 1701 et seq.) and determines that a civil monetary penalty is 
warranted, OFAC will issue a Pre-Penalty Notice informing the alleged 
violator of the agency's intent to impose a monetary penalty. A Pre-
Penalty Notice shall be in writing. The Pre-Penalty Notice may be 
issued whether or not another agency has taken any action with respect 
to the matter. For a description of the contents of a Pre-Penalty 
Notice, see appendix A to part 501 of this chapter.
    (b) Response--(1) Right to respond. An alleged violator has the 
right to respond to a Pre-Penalty Notice by making a written 
presentation to OFAC. For a description of the information that should 
be included in such a response, see appendix A to part 501 of this 
chapter.
    (2) Deadline for response. A response to a Pre-Penalty Notice must 
be made within 30 days as set forth in paragraphs (b)(2)(i) and (ii) of 
this section. The failure to submit a response within 30 days shall be 
deemed to be a waiver of the right to respond.
    (i) Computation of time for response. A response to a Pre-Penalty 
Notice must be postmarked or date-stamped by the U.S. Postal Service 
(or foreign postal service, if mailed abroad) or courier service 
provider (if transmitted to OFAC by courier), or dated if sent by 
email, on or before the 30th day after the postmark date on the 
envelope in which the Pre-Penalty Notice was mailed or date the Pre-
Penalty Notice was emailed. If the Pre-Penalty Notice was personally 
delivered by a non-U.S. Postal Service agent authorized by OFAC, a 
response must be postmarked or date-stamped on or before the 30th day 
after the date of delivery.
    (ii) Extensions of time for response. If a due date falls on a 
Federal holiday or weekend, that due date is extended to include the 
following business day. Any other extensions of time will be granted, 
at the discretion of OFAC, only upon specific request to OFAC.
    (3) Form and method of response. A response to a Pre-Penalty Notice 
need not be in any particular form, but it must be typewritten and 
signed by the alleged violator or a representative thereof (electronic 
signature is acceptable), contain information sufficient to indicate 
that it is in response to the Pre-Penalty Notice, and include the OFAC 
identification number listed on the Pre-Penalty Notice. The response 
must be sent to OFAC's Enforcement Division by mail or courier or email 
and must be postmarked or date-stamped in accordance with paragraph 
(b)(2) of this section.
    (c) Settlement. Settlement discussion may be initiated by OFAC, the 
alleged

[[Page 17740]]

violator, or the alleged violator's authorized representative. For a 
description of practices with respect to settlement, see appendix A to 
part 501 of this chapter.
    (d) Guidelines. Guidelines for the imposition or settlement of 
civil penalties by OFAC are contained in appendix A to part 501 of this 
chapter.
    (e) Representation. A representative of the alleged violator may 
act on behalf of the alleged violator, but any oral communication with 
OFAC prior to a written submission regarding the specific allegations 
contained in the Pre-Penalty Notice must be preceded by a written 
letter of representation, unless the Pre-Penalty Notice was served upon 
the alleged violator in care of the representative.


Sec.  583.703  Penalty imposition.

    If, after considering any written response to the Pre-Penalty 
Notice and any relevant facts, OFAC determines that there was a 
violation by the alleged violator named in the Pre-Penalty Notice and 
that a civil monetary penalty is appropriate, OFAC may issue a Penalty 
Notice to the violator containing a determination of the violation and 
the imposition of the monetary penalty. For additional details 
concerning issuance of a Penalty Notice, see appendix A to part 501 of 
this chapter. The issuance of the Penalty Notice shall constitute final 
agency action. The violator has the right to seek judicial review of 
that final agency action in Federal district court.


Sec.  583.704  Administrative collection; referral to United States 
Department of Justice.

    In the event that the violator does not pay the penalty imposed 
pursuant to this part or make payment arrangements acceptable to OFAC, 
the matter may be referred for administrative collection measures by 
the Department of the Treasury or to the United States Department of 
Justice for appropriate action to recover the penalty in a civil suit 
in a Federal district court.


Sec.  583.705  Findings of Violation.

    (a) When issued. (1) OFAC may issue an initial Finding of Violation 
that identifies a violation if OFAC:
    (i) Determines that there has occurred a violation of any provision 
of this part, or a violation of the provisions of any regulation, 
ruling, instruction, order, directive, or license issued by or pursuant 
to the direction or authorization of the Secretary of the Treasury 
pursuant to this part or otherwise under the International Emergency 
Economic Powers Act (50 U.S.C. 1701 et seq.);
    (ii) Considers it important to document the occurrence of a 
violation; and
    (iii) Based on the Guidelines contained in appendix A to part 501 
of this chapter, concludes that an administrative response is warranted 
but that a civil monetary penalty is not the most appropriate response.
    (2) An initial Finding of Violation shall be in writing and may be 
issued whether or not another agency has taken any action with respect 
to the matter. For additional details concerning issuance of a Finding 
of Violation, see appendix A to part 501 of this chapter.
    (b) Response--(1) Right to respond. An alleged violator has the 
right to contest an initial Finding of Violation by providing a written 
response to OFAC.
    (2) Deadline for response; default determination. A response to an 
initial Finding of Violation must be made within 30 days as set forth 
in paragraphs (b)(2)(i) and (ii) of this section. The failure to submit 
a response within 30 days shall be deemed to be a waiver of the right 
to respond, and the initial Finding of Violation will become final and 
will constitute final agency action. The violator has the right to seek 
judicial review of that final agency action in Federal district court.
    (i) Computation of time for response. A response to an initial 
Finding of Violation must be postmarked or date-stamped by the U.S. 
Postal Service (or foreign postal service, if mailed abroad) or courier 
service provider (if transmitted to OFAC by courier), or dated if sent 
by email, on or before the 30th day after the postmark date on the 
envelope in which the initial Finding of Violation was served or date 
the Finding of Violation was sent by email. If the initial Finding of 
Violation was personally delivered by a non-U.S. Postal Service agent 
authorized by OFAC, a response must be postmarked or date-stamped on or 
before the 30th day after the date of delivery.
    (ii) Extensions of time for response. If a due date falls on a 
federal holiday or weekend, that due date is extended to include the 
following business day. Any other extensions of time will be granted, 
at the discretion of OFAC, only upon specific request to OFAC.
    (3) Form and method of response. A response to an initial Finding 
of Violation need not be in any particular form, but it must be 
typewritten and signed by the alleged violator or a representative 
thereof (electronic signature is acceptable), contain information 
sufficient to indicate that it is in response to the initial Finding of 
Violation, and include the OFAC identification number listed on the 
initial Finding of Violation. The response must be sent to OFAC's 
Enforcement Division by mail or courier or email and must be postmarked 
or date-stamped in accordance with paragraph (b)(2) of this section.
    (4) Information that should be included in response. Any response 
should set forth in detail why the alleged violator either believes 
that a violation of the regulations in this part did not occur and/or 
why a Finding of Violation is otherwise unwarranted under the 
circumstances, with reference to the General Factors Affecting 
Administrative Action set forth in the Guidelines contained in appendix 
A to part 501 of this chapter. The response should include all 
documentary or other evidence available to the alleged violator that 
supports the arguments set forth in the response. OFAC will consider 
all relevant materials submitted in the response.
    (c) Determination--(1) Determination that a Finding of Violation is 
warranted. If, after considering the response, OFAC determines that a 
final Finding of Violation should be issued, OFAC will issue a final 
Finding of Violation that will inform the violator of its decision. A 
final Finding of Violation shall constitute final agency action. The 
violator has the right to seek judicial review of that final agency 
action in Federal district court.
    (2) Determination that a Finding of Violation is not warranted. If, 
after considering the response, OFAC determines a Finding of Violation 
is not warranted, then OFAC will inform the alleged violator of its 
decision not to issue a final Finding of Violation.

    Note 1 to paragraph (c)(2).  A determination by OFAC that a 
final Finding of Violation is not warranted does not preclude OFAC 
from pursuing other enforcement actions consistent with the 
Guidelines contained in appendix A to part 501 of this chapter.

    (d) Representation. A representative of the alleged violator may 
act on behalf of the alleged violator, but any oral communication with 
OFAC prior to a written submission regarding the specific alleged 
violations contained in the initial Finding of Violation must be 
preceded by a written letter of representation, unless the initial 
Finding of Violation was served upon the alleged violator in care of 
the representative.
