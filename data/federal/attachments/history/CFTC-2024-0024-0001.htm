SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION: Under the PRA, 44 U.S.C. 3501 et seq., 
Federal agencies must obtain approval from the Office of Management and 
Budget (OMB) for each collection of information they conduct or 
sponsor. ``Collection of Information'' is defined in 44 U.S.C. 3502(3) 
and 5 CFR 1320.3 and includes agency requests or requirements that 
members of the public submit reports, keep records, or provide 
information to a third party. Section 3506(c)(2)(A) of the PRA, 44 
U.S.C. 3506(c)(2)(A), requires Federal agencies to provide a 60-day 
notice in the Federal Register concerning each proposed collection of 
information before submitting the collection to OMB for approval. To 
comply with this requirement, the CFTC is publishing notice of the 
proposed collection of information listed below.
    Title: Large Trader Reporting for Physical Commodity Swaps (OMB 
Control No. 3038-0095). This is a request for extension of a currently 
approved information collection.
    Abstract: Part 20 of the Commission's regulations (``Reporting 
Rules'') requires clearing organizations and any persons that are 
``reporting entities'' to file swaps position data with the Commission. 
The Reporting Rules collect clearing member reports from clearing 
organizations. The Reporting Rules also require position reports from 
reporting entities for principal and counterparty positions in cleared 
and uncleared physical commodity swaps. Reporting entities are those 
persons that are either ``clearing members'' or ``swap dealers'' that 
are otherwise not clearing members. For purposes of part 20, reporting 
parties are required to submit data on positions on a futures 
equivalent basis so as to allow the Commission to assess a trader's 
market impact across differently structured but linked derivatives 
instruments and markets. This renewal updates the total requested 
burden based on available reported data.
    With respect to the collection of information, the CFTC invites 
comment on:
    <bullet> Whether the proposed collection of information is 
necessary for the proper performance of the functions of the 
Commission, including whether the information will have a practical 
use;
    <bullet> The accuracy of the Commission's estimate of the burden of 
the proposed collection of information, including the validity of the 
methodology and assumptions used;
    <bullet> Ways to enhance the quality, usefulness, and clarity of 
the information to be collected; and
    <bullet> Ways to minimize the burden of collection of information 
on those who are to respond, including through the use of appropriate 
automated electronic, mechanical, or other technological collection 
techniques or other forms of information technology; e.g., permitting 
electronic submission of responses.
    All comments must be submitted in English, or if not, accompanied 
by an English translation. Comments will be posted as received to 
<a href="https://www.cftc.gov">https://www.cftc.gov</a>. You should submit only information that you wish 
to make available publicly. If you wish the Commission to consider 
information that you believe is exempt from disclosure under the 
Freedom of Information Act, a petition for confidential treatment of 
the exempt information may be submitted according to the procedures 
established in Sec.  145.9 of the Commission's regulations.\1\ The 
Commission reserves the right, but shall have no obligation, to review, 
pre-screen, filter, redact, refuse or remove any or all of your 
submission from <a href="https://www.cftc.gov">https://www.cftc.gov</a> that it may deem to be 
inappropriate for publication, such as obscene language. All 
submissions that have been redacted or removed that contain comments on 
the merits of the ICR will be retained in the public comment file and 
will be considered as required under the Administrative Procedure Act 
and other applicable laws, and may be accessible under the Freedom of 
Information Act.
