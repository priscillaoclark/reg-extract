proposed rule change to amend the definition of retail order, and

publication of notice of the filing of a proposed rule change, or 
within such longer period up to 90 days (i) as the Commission may 
designate if it finds such longer period to be appropriate and 
publishes its reasons for so finding or (ii) as to which the self-
regulatory organization consents, the Commission shall either approve 
the proposed rule change, disapprove the proposed rule change, or

Act,\5\ the Commission designates May 13, 2024, as the date by which 
the Commission shall either approve or disapprove, or institute 
proceedings to determine whether to disapprove, the proposed rule 
change (File No. SR-CboeBZX-2024-007).
