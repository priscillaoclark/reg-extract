SECURITIES AND EXCHANGE COMMISSION

[SEC File No. 270-636, OMB Control No. 3235-0679]


Submission for OMB Review; Comment Request; Extension: Form PF & 
Rule 204(b)-1

Upon Written Request, Copies Available From: Securities and Exchange 
Commission, Office of FOIA Services, 100 F Street NE, Washington, DC 
20549-2736

    Notice is hereby given that pursuant to the Paperwork Reduction Act 
of 1995 (44 U.S.C. 3501 et seq.), the Securities and Exchange 
Commission (``Commission'') has submitted to the Office of Management 
and Budget a request for extension of the previously approved 
collection of information discussed below.
    Rule 204(b)-1 (17 CFR 275.204(b)-1) under the Investment Advisers 
Act of 1940 (15 U.S.C. 80b-1 et seq.) implements sections 404 and 406 
of the Dodd-Frank Wall Street Reform and Consumer Protection Act (the 
``Dodd-Frank Act'') by requiring private fund advisers that have at 
least $150 million in private fund assets under management to report 
certain

information regarding the private funds they advise on Form PF. These 
advisers are the respondents to the collection of information.
    Form PF is designed to facilitate the Financial Stability Oversight 
Council's (``FSOC'') monitoring of systemic risk in the private fund 
industry and to assist FSOC in determining whether and how to deploy 
its regulatory tools with respect to nonbank financial companies. The 
Commission and the Commodity Futures Trading Commission may also use 
information collected on Form PF in their regulatory programs, 
including examinations, investigations and investor protection efforts 
relating to private fund advisers.
    Form PF divides respondents into two broad groups, Large Private 
Fund Advisers and smaller private fund advisers. ``Large Private Fund 
Advisers'' are advisers with at least $1.5 billion in assets under 
management attributable to hedge funds (``large hedge fund advisers''), 
advisers that manage ``liquidity funds'' and have at least $1 billion 
in combined assets under management attributable to liquidity funds and 
registered money market funds (``large liquidity fund advisers''), and 
advisers with at least $2 billion in assets under management 
attributable to private equity funds (``large private equity fund 
advisers''). All other respondents are considered smaller private fund 
advisers.
    The Commission estimates that most filers of Form PF have already 
made their first filing, and so the burden hours applicable to those 
filers will reflect only ongoing burdens, and not start-up burdens. 
Accordingly, the Commission estimates the total annual reporting and 
recordkeeping burden of the collection of information for each 
respondent is as follows:
    (a) For smaller private fund advisers making their first Form PF 
filing, an estimated amortized average annual burden of 13 hours for 
each of the first three years;
    (b) for smaller private fund advisers that already make Form PF 
filings, an estimated amortized average annual burden of 15 hours for 
each of the next three years;
    (c) for smaller private fund advisers, an estimated average annual 
burden of 5 hours for event reporting for smaller private equity fund 
advisers for each of the next three years;
    (d) for large hedge fund advisers making their first Form PF 
filing, an estimated amortized average annual burden of 108 hours for 
each of the first three years;
    (e) for large hedge fund advisers that already make Form PF 
filings, an estimated amortized average annual burden of 600 hours for 
each of the next three years;
    (f) for large hedge fund advisers, an estimated average annual 
burden of 10 hours for current reporting for each of the next three 
years;
    (g) for large liquidity fund advisers making their first Form PF 
filing, an estimated amortized average annual burden of 67 hours for 
each of the first three years;
    (h) for large liquidity fund advisers that already make Form PF 
filings, an estimated amortized average annual burden of 284 hours for 
each of the next three years;
    (i) for large private equity fund advisers making their first Form 
PF filing, an estimated amortized average annual burden of 84 hours for 
each of the first three years;
    (j) for large private equity fund advisers that already make Form 
PF filings, an estimated amortized average annual burden of 128 hours 
for each of the next three years; and
    (k) for large private equity fund advisers, an estimated average 
annual burden of 5 hours for event reporting for each of the next three 
years.
    With respect to annual internal costs, the Commission estimates the 
collection of information will result in approximately 122.89 burden 
hours per year on average for each respondent. With respect to external 
cost burdens, the Commission estimates a range from $0 to $50,000 per 
adviser. Estimates of average burden hours and costs are made solely 
for the purposes of the Paperwork Reduction Act and are not derived 
from a comprehensive or even representative survey or study of the 
costs of Commission rules and forms. The changes in burden hours are 
due to the staff's estimates of the time costs and external costs that 
result from the adopted amendments, the use of updated data, and the 
use of different methodologies to calculate certain estimates. 
Compliance with the collection of information requirements of Form PF 
is mandatory for advisers that satisfy the criteria described in 
Instruction 1 to the Form. Responses to the collection of information 
will be kept confidential to the extent permitted by law. The 
Commission does not intend to make public information reported on Form 
PF that is identifiable to any particular adviser or private fund, 
although the Commission may use Form PF information in an enforcement 
action. An agency may not conduct or sponsor, and a person is not 
required to respond to, a collection of information unless it displays 
a currently valid OMB control number.
