SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION: 
    Title of Collection: Making Ends Meet Survey.
    OMB Control Number: 3170-0080.
    Type of Review: Revision of a currently approved collection.
    Affected Public: Individuals or households.
    Estimated Number of Respondents: 4,500.
    Estimated Total Annual Burden Hours: 1,375.
    Abstract: The Dodd-Frank Wall Street Reform and Consumer Protection 
Act charges the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau with researching, 
analyzing, and reporting on topics relating to the CFPB's mission 
including consumer behavior, consumer awareness, and developments in 
markets for consumer financial products and services. To improve its 
understanding of how consumers engage with financial markets, the CFPB 
has successfully used surveys under its ``Making Ends Meet'' program. 
The ``Making Ends Meet'' program has also used the CFPB's Consumer 
Credit Information Panel (CCIP) as a frame to survey people about their 
experiences in consumer credit markets. The CFPB seeks approval for two 
yearly surveys under the ``Making Ends Meet'' program. These surveys 
solicit information on the consumer's experience related to household 
financial shocks, particularly shocks related to the economic effects 
of the COVID-19 pandemic, how households respond to those shocks, and 
the role of savings to help provide a financial buffer.
    The first survey will be a follow-up to respondents from the CFPB's 
2023 ``Making Ends Meet'' survey to better understand household 
financial experiences dealing with medical debt as well as consumers' 
interactions with various financial products. The second survey will go 
to a new sample of consumers from the CCIP and will address several 
topics of interest to the CFPB possibly including the impact of natural 
disasters and other environmental events, credit shopping behavior, 
additional follow-up regarding debt collection, and the assessment of 
various fees throughout the financial services ecosystem.
    Request for Comments: Comments are invited on: (a) Whether the 
collection of information is necessary for the proper performance of 
the functions of the CFPB, including whether the information will have 
practical utility; (b) The accuracy of the CFPB's estimate of the 
burden of the collection of information, including the validity of the 
methods and the assumptions used; (c) Ways to enhance the quality, 
utility, and clarity of the information to be collected; and (d) Ways 
to minimize the burden of the collection of information on respondents, 
including through the use of automated collection techniques or other 
forms of information technology. Comments submitted in response to this 
notice will be summarized and/or included in the request for OMB's 
approval. All comments will become a matter of public record.

Anthony May,
Paperwork Reduction Act Officer, Consumer Financial Protection Bureau.
