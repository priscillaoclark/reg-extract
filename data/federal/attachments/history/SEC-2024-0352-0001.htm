[Release No. 34-99718; File No. SR-NYSEAMER-2024-16]


Self-Regulatory Organizations; NYSE American LLC; Notice of 
Filing and Immediate Effectiveness of Proposed Change To Amend NYSE 
American Rule 4120

March 12, 2024.
    Pursuant to Section 19(b)(1) \1\ of the Securities Exchange Act of 
1934 (``Act'') \2\ and Rule 19b-4 thereunder,\3\ notice is hereby given 
that, on March 5, 2024, NYSE American LLC (``NYSE American'' or the 
``Exchange'') filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission (the 
``Commission'') the proposed rule change as described in Items I and II 
below, which Items have been prepared by the self-regulatory 
organization. The Commission is publishing this notice to solicit 
comments on the proposed rule change from interested persons.

    \1\ 15 U.S.C. 78s(b)(1).
    \2\ 15 U.S.C. 78a.
    \3\ 17 CFR 240.19b-4.
---------------------------------------------------------------------------

I. Self-Regulatory Organization's Statement of the Terms of Substance 
of the Proposed Rule Change

    The Exchange proposes to amend NYSE American Rule 4120 (Regulatory 
Notification and Business Curtailment) to correct a cross-reference in 
subsections (a)(1)(C) and (c)(1)(C). The proposed rule change is 
available on the Exchange's website at <a href="http://www.nyse.com">www.nyse.com</a>, at the principal 
office of the Exchange, and at the Commission's Public Reference Room.

II. Self-Regulatory Organization's Statement of the Purpose of, and 
Statutory Basis for, the Proposed Rule Change

    In its filing with the Commission, the self-regulatory organization 
included statements concerning the purpose of, and basis for, the 
proposed rule change and discussed any comments it received on the 
proposed rule change. The text of those statements may be examined at 
the places specified in Item IV below. The Exchange has prepared 
summaries, set forth in sections A, B, and C below, of the most 
significant parts of such statements.

A. Self-Regulatory Organization's Statement of the Purpose of, and the 
Statutory Basis for, the Proposed Rule Change

1. Purpose
    The Exchange proposes to amend NYSE American Rule 4120 to correct a 
cross-reference in subsections (a)(1)(C) and (c)(1)(C).
    NYSE American Rules 4120(a)(1)(C) and 4120(c)(1)(C) require member 
organizations to notify the Exchange if its net capital falls below the 
level specified in Securities Exchange Act (``SEA'') Rule 17a-11(c)(2). 
The correct cross reference in both rules should be to SEA Rule 17a-
11(b)(2). A recent amendment to SEA Rule 17a-11 resulted in a numbering 
change, and so what was previously SEA Rule 17a-11(c)(2) is now SEA 
17a-11(b)(2).\4\ The Exchange accordingly proposes to correct the 
cross-reference in NYSE American Rules 4120(a)(1)(C) and 4120(c)(1)(C) 
by replacing SEA Rule 17a-11(c)(2) with SEA Rule 17a-11(b)(2).
---------------------------------------------------------------------------

    \4\ See Securities Exchange Act Release No. 87005, 84 FR 68550 
(December 16, 2019) (Recordkeeping and Reporting Requirements for 
Security-Based Swap Dealers, Major Security-Based Swap Participants, 
and Broker-Dealers).
---------------------------------------------------------------------------

2. Statutory Basis
    The Exchange believes that the proposed rule change is consistent 
with Section 6(b)(5) of the Exchange Act,\5\ in that it is designed to 
prevent fraudulent and manipulative acts and practices, to promote just 
and equitable principles of trade, to foster cooperation and 
coordination with persons engaged in facilitating transactions in 
securities, to remove impediments to and perfect the mechanism of a 
free and open market and a national market system and, in general, to 
protect investors and the public interest.
---------------------------------------------------------------------------

    \5\ 15 U.S.C. 78f(b)(5).
---------------------------------------------------------------------------

    The Exchange believes that the proposed change to NYSE American 
Rules 4120(a)(1)(C) and 4120(c)(1)(C) to correct a cross-reference to a 
previously renumbered subsection would remove impediments to and 
perfect the mechanism of a free and open market and a national market 
system because the proposed change is designed to update an external 
rule reference. The Exchange believes that member organizations would 
benefit from the increased clarity, thereby reducing potential 
confusion and ensuring that persons subject to the Exchange's 
jurisdiction, regulators, and the investing public can more easily 
navigate and understand the Exchange's rules. The Exchange further 
believes that the proposed amendment would not be inconsistent with the 
public interest and the protection of investors because investors will 
not be harmed and in fact would benefit from increased clarity, thereby 
reducing potential confusion.

B. Self-Regulatory Organization's Statement on Burden on Competition

    In accordance with Section 6(b)(8) of the Act,\6\ the Exchange 
believes that the proposed rule change would not impose any burden on 
competition that is not necessary or appropriate in furtherance of the 
purposes of the Act. The proposed rule change is not intended to 
address competitive issues but is rather concerned with making a 
correction to Exchange rules. Since the proposal does not substantively 
modify system functionality or processes on the Exchange, the proposed 
changes will not impose any burden on competition.
---------------------------------------------------------------------------

    \6\ 15 U.S.C. 78f(b)(8).
---------------------------------------------------------------------------

C. Self-Regulatory Organization's Statement on Comments on the Proposed 
Rule Change Received From Members, Participants, or Others

    No written comments were solicited or received with respect to the 
proposed rule change.

III. Date of Effectiveness of the Proposed Rule Change and Timing for 
Commission Action

    The Exchange has filed the proposed rule change pursuant to Section 
19(b)(3)(A)(iii) of the Act \7\ and Rule 19b-4(f)(6) thereunder.\8\ 
Because the proposed rule change does not: (i)

[[Page 19375]]

significantly affect the protection of investors or the public 
interest; (ii) impose any significant burden on competition; and (iii) 
become operative prior to 30 days from the date on which it was filed, 
or such shorter time as the Commission may designate, if consistent 
with the protection of investors and the public interest, the proposed 
rule change has become effective pursuant to Section 19(b)(3)(A) of the 
Act \9\ and Rule 19b-4(f)(6)(iii) \10\ thereunder.
---------------------------------------------------------------------------

    \7\ 15 U.S.C. 78s(b)(3)(A)(iii).
    \8\ 17 CFR 240.19b-4(f)(6).
    \9\ 15 U.S.C. 78s(b)(3)(A).
    \10\ 17 CFR 240.19b-4(f)(6)(iii). In addition, Rule 19b-4(f)(6) 
requires a self-regulatory organization to give the Commission 
written notice of its intent to file the proposed rule change, along 
with a brief description and text of the proposed rule change, at 
least five business days prior to the date of filing of the proposed 
rule change, or such shorter time as designated by the Commission. 
The Exchange has satisfied this requirement.
---------------------------------------------------------------------------

    A proposed rule change filed under Rule 19b-4(f)(6) \11\ normally 
does not become operative prior to 30 days after the date of the 
filing. However, pursuant to Rule 19b-4(f)(6)(iii),\12\ the Commission 
may designate a shorter time if such action is consistent with the 
protection of investors and the public interest. The Exchange has asked 
the Commission to waive the 30-day operative delay so that the proposal 
may become operative immediately upon filing. The Exchange states that 
the proposed change will not adversely impact investors and will permit 
the Exchange to promptly correct a rule reference in order to alleviate 
potential investor or public confusion and add clarity to its rules. 
According to the Exchange, because the proposed rule change does not 
raise any novel regulatory issues, the Exchange believes that waiver of 
the operative delay would be consistent with the protection of 
investors and the public interest. The Commission finds that, because 
the proposed rule change merely corrects a rule reference in the 
Exchange's rulebook, waiving the 30-day operative delay is consistent 
with the protection of investors and the public interest. Therefore, 
the Commission hereby waives the operative delay and designates the 
proposal operative upon filing.\13\
---------------------------------------------------------------------------

    \11\ 17 CFR 240.19b-4(f)(6).
    \12\ 17 CFR 240.19b-4(f)(6)(iii).
    \13\ For purposes only of waiving the 30-day operative delay, 
the Commission has considered the proposed rule's impact on 
efficiency, competition, and capital formation. See 15 U.S.C. 
78c(f).
---------------------------------------------------------------------------

    At any time within 60 days of the filing of the proposed rule 
change, the Commission summarily may temporarily suspend such rule 
change if it appears to the Commission that such action is necessary or 
appropriate in the public interest, for the protection of investors, or 
otherwise in furtherance of the purposes of the Act. If the Commission 
takes such action, the Commission shall institute proceedings under 
Section 19(b)(2)(B) of the Act \14\ to determine whether the proposed 
rule change should be approved or disapproved.
---------------------------------------------------------------------------
