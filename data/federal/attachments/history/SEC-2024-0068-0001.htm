SECURITIES AND EXCHANGE COMMISSION

[Release No. 34-99342; File No. SR-NYSEAMER-2024-04]


Self-Regulatory Organizations; NYSE American LLC; Notice of 
Filing and Immediate Effectiveness of Proposed Change To Amend the NYSE 
American Options Fee Schedule

January 12, 2024.
    Pursuant to section 19(b)(1) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 
(the ``Act''),\1\ and Rule 19b-4 thereunder,\2\ notice is hereby given 
that on January 10, 2024, NYSE American LLC (``NYSE American'' or the 
``Exchange'') filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission (the 
``Commission'') the proposed rule change as described in Items I, II, 
and III below, which Items have been prepared by the Exchange. The 
Commission is publishing this notice to solicit comments on the 
proposed rule change from interested persons.
---------------------------------------------------------------------------

    \1\ 15 U.S.C. 78s(b)(1).
    \2\ 17 CFR 240.19b-4.
---------------------------------------------------------------------------

I. Self-Regulatory Organization's Statement of the Terms of Substance 
of the Proposed Rule Change

    The Exchange proposes to amend the NYSE American Options Fee 
Schedule (the ``Fee Schedule'') with respect to the system processing 
fee for the Central Registration Depository (``CRD'' or ``CRD system'') 
collected by the Financial Industry Regulatory Authority, Inc. 
(``FINRA''). The Exchange proposes to implement the fee change on 
January 10, 2024. The proposed rule change is available on the 
Exchange's website at <a href="http://www.nyse.com">www.nyse.com</a>, at the principal office of the 
Exchange, and at the Commission's Public Reference Room.

II. Self-Regulatory Organization's Statement of the Purpose of, and 
Statutory Basis for, the Proposed Rule Change

    In its filing with the Commission, the Exchange included statements 
concerning the purpose of and basis for the proposed rule change and 
discussed any comments it received on the proposed rule change. The 
text of these statements may be examined at the places specified in 
Item IV below. The Exchange has prepared summaries, set forth in 
sections A, B, and C below, of the most significant aspects of such 
statements.

A. Self-Regulatory Organization's Statement of the Purpose of, and 
Statutory Basis for, the Proposed Rule Change

1. Purpose
    The Exchange proposes to amend the Fee Schedule with respect to the 
system processing fee for use of CRD collected by FINRA.\3\ The 
Exchange proposes to implement the fee changes effective January 10, 
2024.\4\
---------------------------------------------------------------------------

    \3\ CRD is the central licensing and registration system for the 
U.S. securities industry. The CRD system enables individuals and 
firms seeking registration with multiple states and self-regulatory 
organizations to do so by submitting a single form, fingerprint 
card, and a combined payment of fees to FINRA. Through the CRD 
system, FINRA maintains the qualification, employment, and 
disciplinary histories of registered associated persons of broker-
dealers.
    \4\ The Exchange originally filed to amend the Fee Schedule on 
December 29, 2023 (SR-NYSE-2023-68)[sic]. SR-NYSE-2023-68[sic] was 
withdrawn on January 10, 2024 and replaced by this filing.
---------------------------------------------------------------------------

    FINRA collects and retains certain regulatory fees via CRD for the 
registration of associated persons of Exchange ATP Holders that are not 
FINRA members (``Non-FINRA ATP Holders'').\5\ CRD fees are user-based, 
and there is no distinction in the cost incurred by FINRA if the user 
is a FINRA member or a Non-FINRA ATP Holders.
---------------------------------------------------------------------------

    \5\ The Exchange originally adopted fees for use of the CRD 
system in 2003 and amended those fees in 2013, 2022 and 2023. See 
Securities Exchange Act Release Nos. 48066 (June 19, 2003), 68 FR 
38409 (June 27, 2003) (SR-Amex-2003-49); 68589 (January 4, 2013), 78 
FR 2465 (January 11, 2013) (SR-NYSEMKT-2012-89); 93901 (January 5, 
2022), 87 FR 1453 (January 11, 2022) (SR-NYSEAMER-2021-48); and 
96717 (January 19, 2023), 88 FR 4857 (January 25, 2023) (SR-
NYSEAMER-2023-07). While the Exchange lists these fees in its Fee 
Schedule, it does not collect or retain these fees.
---------------------------------------------------------------------------

    In 2020, FINRA amended certain fees assessed for use of the CRD 
system for implementation between 2022 and 2024.\6\ The Exchange 
accordingly proposes to amend the Fee Schedule to mirror the system 
processing fee assessed by FINRA, which will be implemented 
concurrently with the amended FINRA fee as of January 2024.\7\ 
Specifically, the Exchange proposes to amend the Fee Schedule to modify 
the system processing fee charged to Non-FINRA ATP Holders for each 
registered

representative and principal from $45 to $70.\8\
---------------------------------------------------------------------------

    \6\ See Securities Exchange Act Release No. 90176 (October 14, 
2020), 85 FR 66592 (October 20, 2020) (SR-FINRA-2020-032).
    \7\ The Exchange notes that it has only adopted the CRD system 
fees charged by FINRA to Non-FINRA ATP Holders when such fees are 
applicable. In this regard, certain FINRA CRD system fees and 
requirements are specific to FINRA members, but do not apply to NYSE 
Arca-only ATP Holders. Non-FINRA ATP Holders have been charged CRD 
system fees since 2005. See note 5, supra. ATP Holders that are also 
FINRA members are charged CRD system fees according to Section 4 of 
Schedule A to the FINRA By-Laws.
    \8\ See Section (4)(b)(7) of Schedule A to the FINRA By-laws.
---------------------------------------------------------------------------

    The Exchange notes that the proposed change is not otherwise 
intended to address any other issues surrounding regulatory fees, and 
the Exchange is not aware of any problems that ATP Holders would have 
in complying with the proposed change.
1. Statutory Basis
    The Exchange believes that the proposed rule change is consistent 
with section 6(b) of the Act,\9\ in general, and furthers the 
objectives of section 6(b)(4) \10\ of the Act, in particular, in that 
it is designed to provide for the equitable allocation of reasonable 
dues, fees, and other charges. The Exchange also believes that the 
proposed rule change is consistent with section 6(b)(5) of the Act,\11\ 
in that it is designed to promote just and equitable principles of 
trade, to foster cooperation and coordination with persons engaged in 
regulating, clearing, settling, processing information with respect to, 
and facilitating transactions in securities, to remove impediments to 
and perfect the mechanism of a free and open market and a national 
market system, and, in general, to protect investors and the public 
interest and is not designed to permit unfair discrimination between 
customers, issuers, brokers, or dealers.
---------------------------------------------------------------------------

    \9\ 15 U.S.C. 78f(b).
    \10\ 15 U.S.C. 78f(b)(4).
    \11\ 15 U.S.C. 78f(b)(5).
---------------------------------------------------------------------------

    The Exchange believes that the proposed fee change is reasonable 
because the fee will be identical to that adopted by FINRA as of 
January 2024 for use of the CRD system to submit an initial or amended 
Form U4, Form U5 or Form BD that includes the initial reporting, 
amendment, or certification of one or more disclosure events or 
proceedings and the posting to CRD each set of fingerprints submitted 
electronically to FINRA. The costs of operating and improving the CRD 
system are similarly borne by FINRA when a Non-FINRA ATP Holder uses 
the CRD system; accordingly, the fees collected for such use should, as 
proposed by the Exchange, mirror the fees assessed to FINRA members. In 
addition, as FINRA noted in amending its fees, it believes that its 
proposed pricing structure is reasonable and correlates fees with the 
components that drive its regulatory costs to the extent feasible. The 
Exchange further believes that the change is reasonable because it will 
provide greater specificity regarding the CRD system fees that are 
applicable to Non-FINRA ATP Holders. All similarly situated ATP Holders 
are subject to the same fee structure, and every ATP Holder must use 
the CRD system for registration and disclosure. Accordingly, the 
Exchange believes that the fees collected for such use should likewise 
increase in lockstep with the fees assessed to FINRA members, as 
proposed by the Exchange.
    The Exchange also believes that the proposed fee change provides 
for the equitable allocation of reasonable fees and other charges, and 
does not unfairly discriminate between customers, issuers, brokers, and 
dealers. The fee applies equally to all individuals and firms required 
to report information the CRD system, and the proposed change will 
result in the same regulatory fees being charged to all ATP Holders 
required to report information to CRD and for services performed by 
FINRA regardless of whether such ATP Holders are FINRA members. 
Accordingly, the Exchange believes that the fee collected for such use 
should increase in lockstep with the fee adopted by FINRA as of January 
2024, as proposed by the Exchange.

B. Self-Regulatory Organization's Statement on Burden on Competition

    In accordance with section 6(b)(8) of the Act,\12\ the Exchange 
believes that the proposed rule change would not impose any burden on 
competition that is not necessary or appropriate in furtherance of the 
purposes of the Act. Specifically, the Exchange believes that the 
proposed change will reflect fees that will be assessed by FINRA as of 
January 2024 and will thus result in the same regulatory fees being 
charged to all ATP Holders required to report information to the CRD 
system and for services performed by FINRA, regardless of whether or 
not such ATP Holders are FINRA members.
---------------------------------------------------------------------------

    \12\ See 15 U.S.C. 78f(b)(8).
---------------------------------------------------------------------------

C. Self-Regulatory Organization's Statement on Comments on the Proposed 
Rule Change Received From Members, Participants, or Others

    The Exchange neither solicited nor received comments on the 
proposed rule change.

III. Date of Effectiveness of the Proposed Rule Change and Timing for 
Commission Action

    The foregoing rule change has become effective pursuant to section 
19(b)(3)(A)(ii) of the Act \13\ and Rule 19b-4(f)(2) \14\ thereunder.
---------------------------------------------------------------------------

    \13\ 15 U.S.C. 78s(b)(3)(A)(ii).
    \14\ 17 CFR 240.19b-4(f)(2).
---------------------------------------------------------------------------

    At any time within 60 days of the filing of the proposed rule 
change, the Commission summarily may temporarily suspend such rule 
change if it appears to the Commission that such action is necessary or 
appropriate in the public interest, for the protection of investors, or 
otherwise in furtherance of the purposes of the Act. If the Commission 
takes such action, the Commission shall institute proceedings to 
determine whether the proposed rule change should be approved or 
disapproved.
