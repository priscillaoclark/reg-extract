I. Self-Regulatory Organization's Statement of the Terms of the 
Substance of the Proposed Rule Change

    The Exchange is filing with the Securities and Exchange Commission 
(``Commission'') a proposed rule change to amend the Fee Schedule on 
the BOX Options Market LLC (``BOX'') options facility to amend certain 
rebates for Qualified Contingent Cross (``QCC'') transactions. The text 
of the proposed rule change is available from the principal office of 
the Exchange, at the Commission's Public Reference Room

[[Page 20260]]

and also on the Exchange's internet website at <a href="https://rules.boxexchange.com/rulefilings">https://rules.boxexchange.com/rulefilings</a>.

II. Self-Regulatory Organization's Statement of the Purpose of, and 
Statutory Basis for, the Proposed Rule Change

    In its filing with the Commission, the Exchange included statements 
concerning the purpose of and basis for the proposed rule change and 
discussed any comments it received on the proposed rule change. The 
text of these statements may be examined at the places specified in 
Item IV below. The Exchange has prepared summaries, set forth in 
Sections A, B, and C below, of the most significant aspects of such 
statements.

A. Self-Regulatory Organization's Statement of the Purpose of, and 
Statutory Basis for, the Proposed Rule Change

1. Purpose
    The Exchange proposes to amend the Fee Schedule for trading on BOX 
to amend certain rebates for Qualified Contingent Cross (``QCC'') 
transactions. A QCC Order is defined as an originating order (Agency 
Order) to buy or sell at least 1,000 standard option contracts, or 
10,000 mini-option contracts, that is identified as being part of a 
qualified contingent trade, coupled with a contra side order to buy or 
sell an equal number of contracts.\5\
---------------------------------------------------------------------------

    \5\ See BOX Rule 7110(c)(6).
---------------------------------------------------------------------------

    Currently, BOX assesses $0.20 per contract to Broker Dealers and 
Market Makers for both the Agency Order and contra order of a QCC 
transaction. Public Customers and Professional Customers are not 
assessed a QCC Transaction Fee. Further, rebates are paid on all 
qualifying orders pursuant to Section IV.D.1 of the BOX Fee Schedule. 
Specifically, a QCC Rebate is paid to the Participant that entered the 
order into the BOX system when at least one party to the QCC 
transaction is a Broker Dealer or Market Maker. The Participant 
receives a per contract rebate on QCC transactions according to the 
tier achieved. Volume thresholds are calculated on a monthly basis by 
totaling the Participant's QCC Agency Order volume on BOX. The Exchange 
notes that the QCC Rebate is intended to incentivize the sending of 
more QCC Orders to BOX.
    The Exchange now proposes to amend the QCC Rebate tiers in Section 
IV.D.1 of the BOX Fee Schedule. Specifically, the Exchange proposes to 
amend the volume thresholds in Tiers 1, 2, and 3. For Tier 1, the 
Exchange proposes to decrease the volume threshold to 0 to 749,999 
contracts from 0 to 999,999 contracts. For Tier 2, the Exchange 
proposes to decrease the volume threshold to 750,000 to 1,499,999 
contracts from 1,000,000 to 1,999,999 contracts. For Tier 3, the 
Exchange proposes to decrease the volume threshold to 1,500,000+ 
contracts from 2,000,000+ contracts.
    The proposed QCC Rebate tier structure will be as follows:

------------------------------------------------------------------------
                  QCC agency order
      Tier         volume on BOX      Rebate 1 (per      Rebate 2 (per
                    (per month)         contract)          contract)
------------------------------------------------------------------------
1..............  0 to 749,999                 ($0.14)            ($0.22)
                  contracts.
2..............  750,000 to                    (0.16)             (0.25)
                  1,499,999
                  contracts.
3..............  1,500,000+                    (0.17)             (0.27)
                  contracts.
------------------------------------------------------------------------

    The Exchange also proposes to amend the QCC Growth Rebate to 
account for the changes discussed above. Specifically, the Exchange 
proposes that if a Participant's QCC Agency Order volume on BOX 
achieves Tier 2 of the QCC Rebate in the month AND the Participant's 
total QCC volume combined with total QOO volume exceeds 5 million 
(formerly 6 million) contracts per month, then the Participant will 
qualify for the rebates in Tier 3 of the QCC Rebate. The Exchange 
believes that the proposed changes discussed above will encourage 
Participants to send increased QCC and QOO order flow to BOX in order 
to achieve a rebate, which will result in increased liquidity on BOX to 
the benefit of all market participants.
2. Statutory Basis
    The Exchange believes that the proposal is consistent with the 
requirements of Section 6(b) of the Act, in general, and Section 
6(b)(4) and 6(b)(5) of the Act,\6\ in particular, in that it provides 
for the equitable allocation of reasonable dues, fees, and other 
charges among BOX Participants and other persons using its facilities 
and does not unfairly discriminate between customers, issuers, brokers 
or dealers.
---------------------------------------------------------------------------

    \6\ 15 U.S.C. 78f(b)(4) and (5).
---------------------------------------------------------------------------

    The Exchange believes the proposed changes to the QCC Rebate tiers 
are reasonable because the proposed changes provide opportunities for 
Participants to receive higher rebates for their QCC Order volume on 
BOX. Further, the Exchange believes the proposed changes to the QCC 
rebate tiers are equitable and not unfairly discriminatory as the 
proposed rebates will apply uniformly to the Participants that reach 
the applicable tiers.
    The Exchange continues to believe that the proposed rebate 
structure and rebate amounts are reasonable as it provides an 
incremental incentive for Participants to strive for the higher tier 
levels, which provide increasingly higher rebates for incrementally 
more QCC volume achieved, which the Exchange believes is a reasonably 
designed incentive for Participants to grow their QCC order flow to 
receive the enhanced rebates.
    The Exchange believes the proposed change to the QCC Growth Rebate 
is reasonable because this rebate provides incentives for BOX 
Participants to engage in increased trading activity which would serve 
to bring additional open outcry liquidity to the Trading Floor and 
additional QCC order flow to BOX. The Exchange believes the proposed 
decrease in total QCC volume combined with total QOO volume will 
encourage Participants to send such order flow to BOX for the 
opportunity to earn the rebate.
    The Exchange believes that the proposed QCC Growth Rebate 
qualifications are reasonable because they offer Participants an 
opportunity to achieve a higher QCC rebate. Additionally, the Exchange 
believes the proposed change to the QCC Growth Rebate is equitable and 
not unfairly discriminatory because any Participant may qualify for 
this rebate.\7\
---------------------------------------------------------------------------

    \7\ The Exchange notes that all BOX Participants may transact an 
options business electronically or on the BOX Trading Floor with a 
registered Trading Permit. BOX Participants may transact business on 
the Trading Floor through a Floor Broker.

---------------------------------------------------------------------------

B. Self-Regulatory Organization's Statement on Burden on Competition

    The Exchange does not believe that the proposed rule change will 
impose any burden on competition not necessary or appropriate in 
furtherance of the purposes of the Act.
    The Exchange believes the proposal does not impose an undue burden 
on inter-market competition because the proposed changes to the QCC 
Rebate and the QCC Growth Rebate will promote competition for QCC 
transactions. Specifically, the volume thresholds required to qualify 
for the rebates will be reduced, which may allow Participants access to 
higher rebates. The Exchange believes further its proposal remains 
competitive with other options markets and will offer market 
participants with another choice of where to transact its business. The 
Exchange notes that it operates in a highly competitive market in which 
market participants can readily favor competing venues if they deem fee 
levels at a particular venue to be excessive, or rebate opportunities 
available at other venues to be more favorable. In such an environment, 
the Exchange must continually adjust its fees and rebates to remain 
competitive with other exchanges. Because competitors are free to 
modify their own fees and rebates in response, and because market 
participants may readily adjust their order routing practices, the 
Exchange believes that the degree to which fee changes in this market 
may impose any burden on competition is extremely limited.
    The proposed changes do not impose an undue burden on intramarket 
competition because the Exchange does not believe that its proposal 
will place any category of market participant at a competitive 
disadvantage. The Exchange believes that the proposed changes will 
encourage market participants to send their QCC orders to BOX for 
execution in order to obtain greater rebates and lower their costs.

C. Self-Regulatory Organization's Statement on Comments on the Proposed 
Rule Change Received From Members, Participants, or Others

    No written comments were either solicited or received.

III. Date of Effectiveness of the Proposed Rule Change and Timing for 
Commission Action

    The foregoing rule change has become effective pursuant to Section 
19(b)(3)(A)(ii) of the Exchange Act \8\ and Rule 19b-4(f)(2) 
thereunder,\9\ because it establishes or changes a due, or fee.
---------------------------------------------------------------------------

    \8\ 15 U.S.C. 78s(b)(3)(A)(ii).
    \9\ 17 CFR 240.19b-4(f)(2).
---------------------------------------------------------------------------

    At any time within 60 days of the filing of the proposed rule 
change, the Commission summarily may temporarily suspend the rule 
change if it appears to the Commission that the action is necessary or 
appropriate in the public interest, for the protection of investors, or 
would otherwise further the purposes of the Act. If the Commission 
takes such action, the Commission shall institute proceedings to 
determine whether the proposed rule should be approved or disapproved.
