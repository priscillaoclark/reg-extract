proposed rule change to amend FINRA Rule 6730 to reduce the 15-minute 
TRACE reporting timeframe to one minute, with exceptions for member 
firms with de minimis reporting activity and for manual trades. The 
proposed rule change was published for comment in the Federal Register 
on January 25, 2024.\3\ section 19(b)(2) of the Act \4\ provides that, 
within 45 days of the publication of notice of the filing of a proposed 
rule change, or within such longer period up to 90 days as the 
Commission may designate if it finds such longer period to be 
appropriate and publishes its reasons for so finding or as to which the 
self-regulatory organization consents, the Commission shall either 
approve the proposed rule change, disapprove the proposed rule change, 
or institute proceedings to determine whether the proposed rule change 
should be disapproved. The 45th day after publication of the notice for 
this proposed rule change is March 10, 2024. The Commission is 
extending this 45-day time period for Commission action. The Commission 
finds that it is appropriate to designate a longer period within which 
to take action on the proposed rule change so that it has sufficient 
time to consider the proposed rule change and the comments received. 
Accordingly, pursuant to section 19(b)(2) of the Act, the Commission 
designates April 24, 2024, as the date by which the Commission shall 
approve or disapprove, or institute proceedings to determine whether to 
disapprove, the proposed rule change (File No. SR-FINRA-2024-004).
