SECURITIES AND EXCHANGE COMMISSION

[SEC File No. 270-182, OMB Control No. 3235-0237]


Submission for OMB Review; Comment Request; Extension: Form N-54A

Upon Written Request, Copies Available From: Securities and Exchange 
Commission, Office of FOIA Services, 100 F Street NE, Washington, DC 
20549-2736

    Notice is hereby given that, pursuant to the Paperwork Reduction 
Act of 1995 (44 U.S.C. 3501 et seq.), the Securities and Exchange 
Commission (``Commission'') has submitted to the Office of Management 
and Budget a request for extension of the previously approved 
collection of information discussed below.
    Under the Investment Company Act of 1940 (15 U.S.C. 80a-1 et seq.) 
(the ``Investment Company Act''), certain investment companies can 
elect to be regulated as business development companies, as defined in 
Section 2(a)(48) of the Investment Company Act (15 U.S.C. 80a-
2(a)(48)). Under Section 54(a) of the Investment Company Act (15 U.S.C. 
80a-53(a)), any company defined in Section 2(a)(48)(A) and (B) may 
elect to be subject to the provisions of Sections 55 through 65 of the 
Investment Company Act (15 U.S.C. 80a-54 to 80a-64) by filing with the 
Commission a notification of election, if such company has: (1) a class 
of equity securities registered under Section 12 of the Securities 
Exchange Act of 1934 (15 U.S.C. 78a et seq.) (``Exchange Act''); or (2) 
filed a registration statement pursuant to Section 12 of the Exchange 
Act for a class of its equity securities. The Commission adopted Form 
N-54A (17 CFR 274.53) as the form for notification of election to be 
regulated as a business development company.
    The purpose of Form N-54A is to notify the Commission that the 
investment company making the notification elects to be subject to 
Sections 55 through 65 of the Investment Company Act, enabling the 
Commission to administer those provisions of the Investment Company Act 
to such companies.
    The Commission estimates that on average approximately 21 business 
development companies file these notifications each year. Each of those 
business development companies need only make a single filing of Form 
N-54A. The Commission further estimates that this information 
collection imposes a burden of 0.5 hours, resulting in a total annual 
PRA burden of 10.5 hours. Based on the estimated wage rate, the total 
cost to the business development company industry of the hour burden 
for complying with Form N-54A would be approximately $4,462.50.
    The collection of information under Form N-54A is mandatory. The 
information provided by the form is not kept confidential. An agency 
may not conduct or sponsor, and a person is not required to respond to, 
a collection of information unless it displays a currently valid 
control number.
    The public may view background documentation for this information 
collection at the following website: <a href="http://www.reginfo.gov">www.reginfo.gov</a>. Find this 
particular information collection by selecting ``Currently under 30-day 
Review--Open for Public Comments'' or by using the search function. 
Written comments and recommendations for the proposed information 
collection should be sent within 30 days of publication of this notice 
by February 21, 2024 to (i) <a href="/cdn-cgi/l/email-protection#eea3acb6c0a1a3acc0a1a7bcafc0bdabadb18a8b9d85b1818888878d8b9cae81838cc08b819ec0898198"><span class="__cf_email__" data-cfemail="662b243e48292b2448292f342748352325390203150d390900000f05031426090b044803091648010910">[email&#160;protected]</span></a>

and Exchange Commission, c/o John Pezzullo, 100 F Street NE, 
Washington, DC 20549, or by sending an email to: <a href="/cdn-cgi/l/email-protection#306062716f7d51595c525f48704355531e575f46"><span class="__cf_email__" data-cfemail="5c0c0e1d03113d35303e33241c2f393f723b332a">[email&#160;protected]</span></a>.
