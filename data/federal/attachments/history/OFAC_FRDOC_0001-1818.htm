Background

    On January 31, 2024, OFAC issued GL 6 to authorize certain 
transactions otherwise prohibited by the Burma Sanctions Regulations, 
31 CFR part 525. GL 6 was made available on OFAC's website (<a href="https://ofac.treasury.gov">https://ofac.treasury.gov</a>) when it was issued. The reference to 31 CFR part 594 
in paragraph (a) of the GL rather than 31 CFR part 525 was an error in 
the original GL, which is reproduced in this publication. The text of 
the GL is provided below.
