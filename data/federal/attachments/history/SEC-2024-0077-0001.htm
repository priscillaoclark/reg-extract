SECURITIES AND EXCHANGE COMMISSION

[Release No. IA-6529]


Notice of Intention To Cancel Registrations of Certain Investment 
Advisers Pursuant to Section 203(H) of the Investment Advisers Act of 
1940

January 12, 2024.
    Notice is given that the Securities and Exchange Commission (the 
``Commission'') intends to issue an order, pursuant to section 203(h) 
of the Investment Advisers Act of 1940 (the ``Act''), cancelling the 
registrations of the investment advisers whose names appear in the 
attached Appendix, hereinafter referred to as the ``registrants.''
    Section 203(h) of the Act provides, in pertinent part, that if the 
Commission finds that any person registered under section 203, or who 
has pending an application for registration filed under that section, 
is no longer in existence, is not engaged in business as an investment 
adviser, or is prohibited from registering as an investment adviser 
under section 203A, the Commission shall by order cancel the 
registration of such person.
    Each registrant listed in the attached Appendix either (a) has not 
filed a Form ADV amendment with the Commission as required by rule 204-
1 under the Act \1\ and appears to be no longer engaged in business as 
an investment adviser or (b) has indicated on Form ADV that it is no 
longer eligible to remain registered with the Commission as an 
investment adviser but has not filed Form ADV-W to withdraw its 
registration. Accordingly, the Commission believes that reasonable 
grounds exist for a finding that these registrants are no longer in 
existence, are not engaged in business as investment advisers, or are 
prohibited from registering as investment advisers under section 203A, 
and that their registrations should be cancelled pursuant to section 
203(h) of the Act.
---------------------------------------------------------------------------

    \1\ Rule 204-1 under the Act requires any adviser that is 
required to complete Form ADV to amend the form at least annually 
and to submit the amendments electronically through the Investment 
Adviser Registration Depository.
---------------------------------------------------------------------------

    Notice is also given that any interested person may, by February 6, 
2024, at 5:30 p.m., submit to the Commission in writing a request for a 
hearing on the cancellation of the registration of any registrant 
listed in the attached Appendix, accompanied by a statement as to the 
nature of such person's interest, the reason for such person's request, 
and the issues, if any, of fact or law proposed to be controverted, and 
the writer may request to be notified if the Commission should order a 
hearing thereon. Any such communication should be emailed to the 
Commission's Secretary at <a href="/cdn-cgi/l/email-protection#5e0d3b3d2c3b2a3f2c272d73113838373d3b1e2d3b3d70393128"><span class="__cf_email__" data-cfemail="1a497f79687f6e7b68636937557c7c73797f5a697f79347d756c">[email&#160;protected]</span></a>.
    At any time after February 6, 2024, the Commission may issue an 
order or orders cancelling the registrations of any or all of the 
registrants listed in the attached Appendix, upon the basis of the 
information stated above, unless an order or orders for a hearing on 
the cancellation shall be issued upon request or upon the Commission's 
own motion. Persons who requested a hearing, or who requested to be 
advised as to whether a hearing is ordered, will receive any notices 
and orders issued in this matter, including the date of the hearing (if 
ordered) and any postponements thereof. Any registrant whose 
registration is cancelled under delegated authority may appeal that 
decision directly to the Commission in accordance with rules 430 and 
431 of the Commission's rules of practice (17 CFR 201.430 and 431).
