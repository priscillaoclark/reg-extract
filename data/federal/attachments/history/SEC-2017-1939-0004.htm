SECURITIES AND EXCHANGE COMMISSION

[SEC File No. 270-118, OMB Control No. 3235-0095]


Proposed Collection; Comment Request; Extension: Rule 236--
Exemption of Shares Offered in Connection With Certain Transactions

Upon Written Request Copies Available From: Securities and Exchange 
Commission, Office of FOIA Services, 100 F Street NE, Washington, DC 
20549-2736

    Notice is hereby given that, pursuant to the Paperwork Reduction 
Act of 1995 (44 U.S.C. 3501 et seq.), the Securities and Exchange 
Commission (``Commission'') is soliciting comments on the collection of 
information summarized below. The Commission plans to submit this 
existing collection of information to the Office of Management and 
Budget for extension and approval.
    Securities Act Rule 236 (17 CFR 230.236) provides an exemption from 
registration under the Securities Act for the offering of shares of 
stock or similar securities to provide funds to be distributed to 
security holders in lieu of fractional shares, scrip certificates or 
order forms, in connection with a stock dividend, stock split, reverse 
stock split, conversion, merger or similar transaction. Issuers wishing 
to rely upon the exemption are required to furnish specified 
information to the Commission at least 10 days prior to the offering. 
The information is needed to provide notice that the issuer is relying 
on the exemption. Approximately 10 respondents file the information 
required by Rule 236 at an estimated 1.5 hours per response for a total 
annual reporting burden of 15 hours (1.5 hours per response x 10 
responses).
    Written comments are invited on: (a) whether this proposed 
collection of information is necessary for the proper performance of 
the functions of the agency, including whether the information will 
have practical utility; (b) the accuracy of the agency's estimate of 
the burden imposed by the collection of information; (c) ways to 
enhance the quality, utility, and clarity of the information collected; 
and (d) ways to minimize the burden of the collection of information on 
respondents, including through the use of automated collection 
techniques or other forms of information technology. Consideration will 
be given to comments and suggestions submitted in writing within 60 
days of this publication by April 12, 2024.
    An agency may not conduct or sponsor, and a person is not required 
to respond to, a collection of information unless it displays a 
currently valid control number.
    Please direct your written comment to David Bottom, Director/Chief 
Information Officer, Securities and Exchange Commission, c/o John 
Pezzullo, 100 F Street NE, Washington, DC 20549 or send an email to:
