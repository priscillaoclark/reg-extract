SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION: This form is used by an exporter (or broker 
acting on its behalf) in order to obtain approval for coverage of the 
repayment risk of export sales. The information received allows EXIM 
staff to make a determination of the eligibility of the applicant and 
the creditworthiness of one of the applicant's foreign buyers for EXIM 
assistance under its programs.
    The application tool can be reviewed at: <a href="https://img.exim.gov/s3fs-public/pub/pending/eib23-02.pdf">https://img.exim.gov/s3fs-public/pub/pending/eib23-02.pdf</a>.
    Title and Form Number: EIB 23-02, Application for Equity Express 
Select Insurance.
    OMB Number: 3048-0060.
    Type of Review: Regular.
    Need and Use: This is the application form for use by underserved 
U.S. businesses with limited export experience. Companies that are 
eligible to use the Equity Express Select policy will need to answer 
approximately 20 questions and sign an acknowledgement of the 
certifications that appear on the reverse of the application form. This 
program does not provide discretionary credit authority to the U.S. 
exporter, and therefore the financial and credit information needs are 
minimized.

of U.S. goods and services.
    Annual Number of Respondents: 500.
    Estimated Time per Respondent: 0.25 hours.
