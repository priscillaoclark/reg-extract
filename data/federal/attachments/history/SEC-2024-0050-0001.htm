Self-Regulatory Organizations; Cboe EDGX Exchange, Inc.; Notice 
of Filing and Immediate Effectiveness of a Proposed Rule Change To 
Amend Its Fee Schedule

January 9, 2024.
    Pursuant to Section 19(b)(1) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 
(the ``Act''),\1\ and Rule 19b-4 thereunder,\2\ notice is hereby given 
that on January 2, 2024, Cboe EDGX Exchange, Inc. (the ``Exchange'' or 
``EDGX'') filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission (the 
``Commission'') the proposed rule change as described in Items I, II, 
and III below, which Items have been prepared by the Exchange. The 
Commission is publishing this notice to solicit comments on the 
proposed rule change from interested persons.

I. Self-Regulatory Organization's Statement of the Terms of Substance 
of the Proposed Rule Change

    Cboe EDGX Exchange, Inc. (the ``Exchange'' or ``EDGX'') proposes to 
amend its Fee Schedule. The text of the proposed rule change is 
provided in Exhibit 5.
    The text of the proposed rule change is also available on the 
Exchange's website (<a href="http://markets.cboe.com/us/options/regulation/rule_filings/edgx/">http://markets.cboe.com/us/options/regulation/rule_filings/edgx/</a>), at the Exchange's Office of the Secretary, and at 
the Commission's Public Reference Room.

II. Self-Regulatory Organization's Statement of the Purpose of, and 
Statutory Basis for, the Proposed Rule Change

    In its filing with the Commission, the Exchange included statements 
concerning the purpose of and basis for the proposed rule change and 
discussed any comments it received on the proposed rule change. The 
text of these statements may be examined at the places specified in 
Item IV below. The Exchange has prepared summaries, set forth in 
sections A, B, and C below, of the most significant aspects of such 
statements.

A. Self-Regulatory Organization's Statement of the Purpose of, and 
Statutory Basis for, the Proposed Rule Change

1. Purpose
    The Exchange proposes to amend its Fee Schedule, effective January 
2, 2024. The Exchange first notes that it operates in a highly 
competitive market in which market participants can readily direct 
order flow to competing venues if they deem fee levels at a particular 
venue to be excessive or incentives to be insufficient. More 
specifically, the Exchange is only one of 17 options venues to which 
market participants may direct their order flow. Based on publicly 
available information, no single options exchange has more than 12% of 
the market share.\3\ Thus, in such a low-concentrated and highly 
competitive market, no single options exchange, including the Exchange, 
possesses significant pricing power in the execution of option order 
flow. The Exchange believes that the ever-shifting market share among 
the exchanges from month to month demonstrates that market participants 
can shift order flow or discontinue to reduce use of certain categories 
of products, in response to fee

[[Page 2660]]

changes. Accordingly, competitive forces constrain the Exchange's 
transaction fees, and market participants can readily trade on 
competing venues if they deem pricing levels at those other venues to 
be more favorable.
---------------------------------------------------------------------------

    \3\ See Cboe Global Markets U.S. Options Market Monthly Volume 
Summary (December 19, 2023), available at <a href="https://markets.cboe.com/us/options/market_statistics/">https://markets.cboe.com/us/options/market_statistics/</a>.
---------------------------------------------------------------------------

    The Exchange's Fee Schedule sets forth standard rebates and rates 
applied per contract. For example, the Exchange provides standard 
rebates ranging from $0.01 up to $0.22 per contract for Customer orders 
in both Penny and Non-Penny Securities. The Fee Codes and Associated 
Fees section of the Fees Schedule also provides for certain fee codes 
associated with certain order types and market participants that 
provide for various other fees or rebates. For example, the Exchange 
assesses a fee of $0.70 per contract for Market Maker orders that 
remove liquidity in Non-Penny Securities, yielding fee code NT. The 
Exchange now proposes to decrease the standard fee for Market Maker 
orders that remove liquidity in Non-Penny Securities (i.e., yield fee 
code NT) from $0.70 per contract to $0.30 per contract.
2. Statutory Basis
    The Exchange believes the proposed rule change is consistent with 
the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 (the ``Act'') and the rules and 
regulations thereunder applicable to the Exchange and, in particular, 
the requirements of Section 6(b) of the Act.\4\ Specifically, the 
Exchange believes the proposed rule change is consistent with the 
Section 6(b)(5) \5\ requirements that the rules of an exchange be 
designed to prevent fraudulent and manipulative acts and practices, to 
promote just and equitable principles of trade, to foster cooperation 
and coordination with persons engaged in regulating, clearing, 
settling, processing information with respect to, and facilitating 
transactions in securities, to remove impediments to and perfect the 
mechanism of a free and open market and a national market system, and, 
in general, to protect investors and the public interest. Additionally, 
the Exchange believes the proposed rule change is consistent with the 
Section 6(b)(5) \6\ requirement that the rules of an exchange not be 
designed to permit unfair discrimination between customers, issuers, 
brokers, or dealers. The Exchange also believes the proposed rule 
change is consistent with Section 6(b)(4) of the Act,\7\ which requires 
that Exchange rules provide for the equitable allocation of reasonable 
dues, fees, and other charges among its Trading Permit Holders and 
other persons using its facilities.

---------------------------------------------------------------------------

    As described above, the Exchange operates in a highly competitive 
market in which market participants can readily direct order flow to 
competing venues if they deem fee levels at a particular venue to be 
excessive or incentives to be insufficient. The proposed rule change 
reflects a competitive pricing structure designed to incentivize market 
participants to direct their order flow to the Exchange, which the 
Exchange believes would enhance market quality to the benefit of all 
market participants. The Exchange is only one of several options venues 
to which market participants may direct their order flow, and it 
represents a small percentage of the overall market. The proposed fee 
changes reflect a competitive pricing structure designed to incentivize 
market participants to direct their order flow, which the Exchange 
believes would enhance market quality to the benefit of all Members.
    The Exchange believes the proposed change to decrease the standard 
fee for Market Maker orders that remove liquidity in Non-Penny 
Securities (i.e., yield fee code NT) from $0.70 to $0.30 is reasonable, 
equitable, and not unfairly discriminatory. The Exchange believes the 
proposed rate change is reasonable because, as stated above, in order 
to operate in the highly competitive options markets, the Exchange and 
its competing exchanges seek to offer similar pricing structures, 
including assessing comparable rates for various types of orders. Thus, 
the Exchange believes the proposed rate is reasonable as it is lower 
than the amounts assessed for similar Market Maker orders on other 
options exchanges.\8\ The Exchange also believes that amending the 
standard fee amount associated with fee code NT represents an equitable 
allocation of fees and is not unfairly discriminatory because the fee 
will continue to automatically and uniformly apply to all Members' 
respective qualifying Market Maker orders.
---------------------------------------------------------------------------

    \8\ See, e.g., MEMX Options Exchange Fee Schedule, Transactions 
Fees, which assesses a charge of $1.10 for Market Maker orders that 
remove liquidity in Non-Penny Securities; and NYSE Arca Fee 
Schedule, Transaction Fee for Electronic Executions--Per Contract, 
which provides Market Makers that remove liquidity are assessed 
$1.10 per contract in Non-Penny Issues.
---------------------------------------------------------------------------

    The Exchange believes that the proposed change will incentivize 
Market Maker order flow in Non-Penny Securities, which may lead to an 
increase in liquidity on the Exchange. An overall increase in liquidity 
benefits all market participants by providing more trading 
opportunities, which attracts Market Makers. An increase in Market 
Maker activity in turn facilitates tighter spreads, which may cause an 
additional corresponding increase in order flow from other market 
participants.

B. Self-Regulatory Organization's Statement on Burden on Competition

    The Exchange does not believe that the proposed rule change will 
impose any burden on competition that is not necessary or appropriate 
in furtherance of the purposes of the Act. The Exchange does not 
believe that the proposed rule change will impose any burden on 
intramarket competition that is not necessary or appropriate in 
furtherance of the purposes of the Act, as the proposed fee code change 
applies uniformly and automatically to all Members' respective 
qualifying orders. Overall, the proposed change is designed to attract 
additional Market Maker order flow to the Exchange and overall order 
flow directly to the Exchange's Book. The Exchange believes that the 
fee change will attract further Market Maker activity, further 
incentivize the provision of liquidity and continued order flow to the 
Book, and improve price transparency on the Exchange. Greater overall 
order flow and pricing transparency benefits all market participants on 
the Exchange by generally providing a cycle of more trading 
opportunities, enhancing market quality, and continuing to encourage 
Members to submit order flow and continue to contribute towards a 
robust and well-balanced market ecosystem to the benefit of all market 
participants.
    Next, the Exchange believes the proposed rule change does not 
impose any burden on intermarket competition that is not necessary or 
appropriate in furtherance of the purposes of the Act. As previously 
discussed, the Exchange operates in a highly competitive market. 
Members have numerous alternative venues that they may participate on 
and direct their order flow, including 16 other options exchanges and 
off-exchange venues and alternative trading systems. Additionally, the 
Exchange represents a small percentage of the overall market. Based on 
publicly available information, no single options exchange has more 
than 12% of the market share.\9\ Therefore, no exchange possesses 
significant pricing power in the execution of order flow. Indeed, 
participants can readily choose to send their orders to other exchange 
and off-

[[Page 2661]]

exchange venues if they deem fee levels at those other venues to be 
more favorable. Moreover, the Commission has repeatedly expressed its 
preference for competition over regulatory intervention in determining 
prices, products, and services in the securities markets. Specifically, 
in Regulation NMS, the Commission highlighted the importance of market 
forces in determining prices and SRO revenues and, also, recognized 
that current regulation of the market system ``has been remarkably 
successful in promoting market competition in its broader forms that 
are most important to investors and listed companies.'' \10\ The fact 
that this market is competitive has also long been recognized by the 
courts. In NetCoalition v. Securities and Exchange Commission, the D.C. 
Circuit stated as follows: ``[n]o one disputes that competition for 
order flow is `fierce.' . . . As the SEC explained, `[i]n the U.S. 
national market system, buyers and sellers of securities, and the 
broker-dealers that act as their order-routing agents, have a wide 
range of choices of where to route orders for execution'; [and] `no 
exchange can afford to take its market share percentages for granted' 
because `no exchange possesses a monopoly, regulatory or otherwise, in 
the execution of order flow from broker dealers' . . . .''.\11\ 
Accordingly, the Exchange does not believe its proposed fee change 
imposes any burden on competition that is not necessary or appropriate 
in furtherance of the purposes of the Act.
