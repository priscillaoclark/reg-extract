Joint Industry Plan; Notice of Designation of a Longer Period for 
Commission Action on a Proposed Amendment To Modify the Options Price 
Reporting Authority's Fee Schedule Regarding Caps on Certain Port Fees

January 25, 2024.
    On July 14, 2023, the Options Price Reporting Authority (``OPRA''), 
pursuant to Section 11A of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 
(``Act'') \1\ and Rule 608 of Regulation National Market System 
(``Regulation NMS'') thereunder,\2\ filed with the Securities and 
Exchange Commission (``Commission''), a proposed amendment to the Plan 
for Reporting of Consolidated Options Last Sale Reports and Quotation 
Information (``OPRA Plan'').\3\ The proposed OPRA Plan amendment 
(``Proposed Amendment'') would amend the OPRA Fee Schedule to reflect 
the applicable monthly fee caps on certain connectivity ports that are 
used to access OPRA data. The Proposed Amendment was published for 
comment in the Federal Register on August 2, 2023.\4\
---------------------------------------------------------------------------

    \1\ 15 U.S.C. 78k-1.
    \2\ 17 CFR 242.608.
    \3\ The OPRA Plan is a national market system plan approved by 
the Commission pursuant to Section 11A of the Act and Rule 608 
thereunder. See Securities Exchange Act Release No. 17638 (Mar. 18, 
1981), 22 SEC. Docket 484 (Mar. 31, 1981). The full text of the OPRA 
Plan and a list of its participants are available at <a href="https://www.opraplan.com/">https://www.opraplan.com/</a>. The OPRA Plan provides for the collection and 
dissemination of last sale and quotation information on options that 
are traded on the participant exchanges.
    \4\ See Securities Exchange Act Release No. 98012 (July 27, 
2023), 88 FR 50939 (``Notice'').
---------------------------------------------------------------------------

    On September 25, 2023, the Commission instituted proceedings 
pursuant to Rule 608(b)(2)(i) of Regulation NMS \5\ to determine 
whether to disapprove the Proposed Amendment or to approve the Proposed 
Amendment with any changes or subject to any conditions the Commission 
deems necessary or appropriate.\6\
---------------------------------------------------------------------------

    \5\ 17 CFR 242.608(b)(2)(i).
    \6\ See Securities Exchange Act Release No. 98514 (Sept. 25, 
2023), 88 FR 67398 (Sept. 29, 2023).
---------------------------------------------------------------------------

    Rule 608(b)(2)(i) of Regulation NMS provides that proceedings to 
determine whether a plan or amendment should be disapproved shall be 
concluded within 180 days of the date of publication of notice of the 
plan or amendment and that the time for conclusion of such proceedings 
may be extended for up to 60 days (up to 240 days from the date of 
notice publication) if the Commission determines that a longer period 
is appropriate and publishes the reasons for such determination or the 
plan participants consent to a longer period.\7\ The 180th day after 
publication of the Notice for the Proposed Amendment is January 29, 
2024. The Commission is extending this 180-day period.
---------------------------------------------------------------------------

    \7\ 17 CFR 242.608(b)(2)(i).
---------------------------------------------------------------------------

    The Commission finds that it is appropriate to designate a longer 
period within which to conclude proceedings regarding the Proposed 
Amendment so that it has sufficient time to consider any issues raised 
by the Proposed Amendment. Accordingly, pursuant to Rule 608(b)(2)(i) 
of Regulation NMS,\8\ the Commission designates March 29, 2024, as the 
date by which the Commission shall conclude the proceedings to 
determine whether to approve or disapprove the Proposed Amendment or to 
approve the Proposed Amendment with any changes or subject to any 
conditions the Commission deems necessary or appropriate (File No. SR-
OPRA-2023-01).
---------------------------------------------------------------------------

    \8\ Id.

    For the Commission, by the Division of Trading and Markets, 
pursuant to delegated authority.\9\
---------------------------------------------------------------------------

    \9\ 17 CFR 200.30-3(a)(85).
