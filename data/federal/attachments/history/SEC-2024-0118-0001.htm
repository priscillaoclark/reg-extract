SECURITIES AND EXCHANGE COMMISSION

[Release No. 34-99416; File No. SR-CBOE-2024-006]


Self-Regulatory Organizations; Cboe Exchange, Inc.; Notice of 
Filing of a Proposed Rule Change and Amendment No. 1 Thereto To List 
and Trade Options That Overlie a Reduced Value of the MSCI World Index, 
the Full Value of the MSCI ACWI Index, and a Reduced Value of the MSCI 
USA Index

January 23, 2024.
    Pursuant to Section 19(b)(1) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 
(the ``Act''),\1\ and Rule 19b-4 thereunder,\2\ notice is hereby given 
that on January 10, 2024, Cboe Exchange, Inc. (the ``Exchange'' or 
``Cboe Options'') filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission 
(the ``Commission'') the proposed rule change as described in Items I, 
II, and III below, which Items have been prepared by the Exchange. On 
January 17, 2024, the Exchange filed Amendment No. 1 to the proposed 
rule change.\3\ The Commission is publishing this notice to solicit 
comments on the proposed rule change, as modified by Amendment No. 1, 
from interested persons.
---------------------------------------------------------------------------

    \1\ 15 U.S.C. 78s(b)(1).
    \2\ 17 CFR 240.19b-4.
    \3\ In Amendment No. 1, the Exchange proposed to delete the 
proposed rule change to add MSCI USA Index options to the list of 
options in Rule 5.1(b)(2)(E) for which the last trading day will be 
the business day prior to the expiration date of the specific 
series. Therefore, under the proposal as modified by Amendment No. 
1, the last trading day for these options would be the expiration 
date of the specific series.
---------------------------------------------------------------------------

I. Self-Regulatory Organization's Statement of the Terms of Substance 
of the Proposed Rule Change

    Cboe Exchange, Inc. (the ``Exchange'' or ``Cboe Options'') proposes 
to list and trade options that overlie a reduced value of the MSCI 
World Index, the full value of the MSCI ACWI Index, and a reduced value 
of the MSCI USA Index. The text of the proposed rule change is provided 
in Exhibit 5.
    The text of the proposed rule change is also available on the 
Exchange's website (<a href="http://www.cboe.com/AboutCBOE/CBOELegalRegulatoryHome.aspx">http://www.cboe.com/AboutCBOE/CBOELegalRegulatoryHome.aspx</a>), at the Exchange's Office of the 
Secretary, and at the Commission's Public Reference Room.

II. Self-Regulatory Organization's Statement of the Purpose of, and 
Statutory Basis for, the Proposed Rule Change

    In its filing with the Commission, the Exchange included statements 
concerning the purpose of and basis for the proposed rule change and 
discussed any comments it received on the proposed rule change. The 
text of these statements may be examined at the places specified in 
Item IV below. The Exchange has prepared summaries, set forth in 
sections A, B, and C below, of the most significant aspects of such 
statements.

A. Self-Regulatory Organization's Statement of the Purpose of, and 
Statutory Basis for, the Proposed Rule Change

1. Purpose
    The purpose of this proposed rule change is to amend certain rules 
to permit the Exchange to list and trade options that overlie a reduced 
value of the MSCI World Index, the full value of the MSCI ACWI Index, 
and a reduced value of the MSCI USA Index.\4\ Each of these indexes is 
a free float-adjusted market capitalization index designed to measure 
equity market performance throughout the world (MSCI World and ACWI 
Indexes) or the United States (MSCI USA Index). MSCI World Index 
options (``MXWLD options''), MSCI ACWI Index options (``MXACW 
options''), and MSCI USA Index options (``MXUSA options'') would be 
P.M.-, cash-settled contracts with European-style exercise.
---------------------------------------------------------------------------

    \4\ The proposed rule change amends Rule 4.13, Interpretation 
and Policy .06 to provide that the current index value of the 
reduced-value options on the MSCI World Index and the MSCI USA Index 
will be 1/100th the value of the applicable underlying index 
reported by the reporting authority.
---------------------------------------------------------------------------

Index Design, Methodology, and Dissemination
    The MSCI World, ACWI, and USA Indexes are calculated by MSCI Inc. 
(``MSCI''), which is a provider of investment support tools.\5\ Each of 
these indexes is calculated in U.S. dollars on a real-time basis from 
the open of the first market on which the components are traded to the 
closing of the last market on which the components are traded. The 
methodology used to calculate each index is similar to the methodology 
used to calculate the value of other benchmark market-capitalization 
weighted indexes (including the MSCI EAFE and EM Indexes, on which the 
Exchange may currently list options).\6\ Specifically, each index is 
based on the MSCI Global Investable Market Indexes (``GIMI'') 
Methodology.\7\ The level of each index reflects the free float-
adjusted market value of the component stocks relative to a particular 
base date and is computed by dividing the total market value of the 
companies in the index by the index divisor.
---------------------------------------------------------------------------

    \5\ See proposed Rule 4.12(c) (adding MSCI Inc. as the reporting 
authority for MSCI World Index, MSCI ACWI Index, and MSCI USA 
Index).
    \6\ See current Rule 4.10(h); see also Securities Exchange Act 
Release No. 74681 (April 8, 2015), 80 FR 20032 (April 14, 2015) (SR-
CBOE-2015-023) (order approving proposed rule change to adopt rules 
to permit listing and trading of options on the MSCI EAFE Index 
(``EAFE options'') and the MSCI EM Index) (``EM options'') (``MSCI 
EAFE and EM Approval'').
    \7\ See summary and comprehensive information about the GIMI 
methodology, available at <a href="https://www.msci.com/index/methodology/latest/GIMI">https://www.msci.com/index/methodology/latest/GIMI</a>.
---------------------------------------------------------------------------

    MSCI monitors and maintains each of the MSCI World, ACWI, and USA 
Indexes. Adjustments to each index are made on a daily basis with 
respect to corporate events and dividends. MSCI reviews each index on a 
quarterly basis (February, May, August and November) ``with the 
objective of reflecting the evolution of the underlying equity markets 
and segments on a timely basis, while seeking to achieve: [i]ndex 
continuity, [c]ontinuous investability of constituents and 
replicability of the indexes, and [i]ndex stability and low index 
turnover.'' \8\ Each quarterly review of the MSCI World, ACWI, and USA 
Index involves, among other things, updating the constituent 
securities.\9\
---------------------------------------------------------------------------

    \8\ See id. at Section 3.
    \9\ Id.
---------------------------------------------------------------------------

    For each of the MSCI World, ACWI, and USA Index, real-time data is 
distributed approximately every 15 seconds while the index is being 
calculated using MSCI's real-time

[[Page 5590]]

calculation engine to major quotation vendors, including Bloomberg L.P. 
(``Bloomberg''), FactSet Research Systems, Inc. (``FactSet''), and LSEG 
Data & Analytics (``LSEG''). End of day data is distributed daily to 
clients through MSCI as well as through major quotation vendors, 
including Bloomberg, FactSet, and LSEG.
MSCI World Index
    The MSCI World Index is a free float-adjusted market capitalization 
index that is designed to measure the equity market performance of 
developed markets. The MSCI World Index consists of component stocks 
from 23 developed markets.\10\ The MSCI World Index consists of large- 
and mid-cap components across these markets, has 1,509 constituents, 
and covers approximately 85% of the free float-adjusted market 
capitalization in each country.\11\ The MSCI World Index was launched 
on March 31, 1986.
---------------------------------------------------------------------------

    \10\ These developed markets include Australia, Austria, 
Belgium, Canada, Denmark, Finland, France, Germany, Hong Kong, 
Ireland, Israel, Italy, Japan, Netherlands, New Zealand, Norway, 
Portugal, Singapore, Spain, Sweden, Switzerland, the United Kingdom, 
and the United States.
    \11\ See MSCI World Index fact sheet (dated November 30, 2023), 
available at MSCI World Index.
---------------------------------------------------------------------------

    The Exchange notes that the iShares MSCI World ETF exchange-traded 
fund (``ETF'') is an actively traded product. The Exchange also lists 
options overlying that ETF (``URTH options'') and those options are 
actively traded as well. MSCI World Index futures contracts (``MWS 
futures'') are listed for trading on the ICE Futures U.S.\12\ and other 
derivatives contracts on the MSCI World Index are listed for trading in 
Europe.
---------------------------------------------------------------------------

    \12\ See MWS futures contract specifications, available at MSCI 
World NTR Index Future (<a href="http://ice.com">ice.com</a>).
---------------------------------------------------------------------------

    The Exchange proposes to base trading in options on the MSCI World 
Index on a fraction of the full size of the index. In particular, the 
Exchange propose to list MXWLD options that are based on 1/100th of the 
value of the MSCI World Index. The Exchange believes that listing 
options on the reduced value of the index will attract a greater source 
of customer business than if options were based on the full value of 
the MSCI World Index. The Exchange further believes that listing 
options on a reduced value of the index may enhance investors' 
opportunities to hedge, or speculate on, the market risk associated 
with the stocks comprising the MSCI World Index. Additionally, by 
reducing the value of the MSCI World Index, investors will be able to 
use this trading vehicle while extending a smaller outlay of capital. 
The Exchange believes this may attract additional investors, and, in 
turn, create a more active and liquid trading environment.
MSCI ACWI Index
    The MSCI ACWI Index is a free float-adjusted market capitalization 
index that is designed to measure the equity performance of developed 
markets and emerging markets. The MSCI ACWI Index consists of component 
stocks from 23 developed markets \13\ and 24 emerging markets.\14\ The 
MSCI ACWI Index consists of large- and mid-cap components across these 
markets, has 2,946 constituents, and covers approximately 85% of the 
global investable equity opportunity set.\15\ The MSCI ACWI Index was 
launched on May 31, 1990.
---------------------------------------------------------------------------

    \13\ These developed markets include Australia, Austria, 
Belgium, Canada, Denmark, Finland, France, Germany, Hong Kong, 
Ireland, Israel, Italy, Japan, Netherlands, New Zealand, Norway, 
Portugal, Singapore, Spain, Sweden, Switzerland, the United Kingdom, 
and the United States.
    \14\ These emerging markets include Brazil, Chile, China, 
Colombia, Czech Republic, Egypt, Greece, Hungary, India, Indonesia, 
Korea, Kuwait, Malaysia, Mexico, Peru, Philippines, Poland, Qatar, 
Saudi Arabia, South Africa, Taiwan, Thailand, Turkey, and the United 
Arab Emirates.
    \15\ See MSCI ACWI Index fact sheet (dated November 30, 2023), 
available at MSCI ACWI Index.
---------------------------------------------------------------------------

    The Exchange notes that the iShares MSCI ACWI ETF is an actively 
traded product. The Exchange also lists options overlying that ETF 
(``ACWI options'') and those options are actively traded as well. MSCI 
ACWI Index futures contracts (``MMW futures'') are listed for trading 
on the ICE Futures U.S.\16\ and other derivatives contracts on the MSCI 
ACWI Index are listed for trading in Europe.
---------------------------------------------------------------------------

    \16\ See MMW futures contract specifications, available at MSCI 
ACWI NTR Index Future (<a href="http://ice.com">ice.com</a>).
---------------------------------------------------------------------------

MSCI USA Index
    The MSCI USA Index is a free float-adjusted market capitalization 
index that is designed to measure the performance of the large- and 
mid-cap segments of the U.S. market. The MSCI USA Index consists of 
large- and mid-cap components from the United States, has 625 
constituents, and covers approximately 85% of the free float-adjusted 
market capitalization in the United States.\17\ The MSCI USA Index was 
launched on March 31, 1986.
---------------------------------------------------------------------------

    \17\ See MSCI USA Index fact sheet (dated November 30, 2023), 
available at MSCI USA Index.
---------------------------------------------------------------------------

    The Exchange notes that the Invesco MSCI USA ETF is an actively 
traded product.\18\ MSCI USA Index futures contracts (``USS futures'') 
are listed for trading on the ICE Futures U.S.\19\ and other 
derivatives contracts on the MSCI USA Index are listed for trading in 
Europe.
---------------------------------------------------------------------------

    \18\ The Invesco MSCI USA ETF does not currently satisfy 
criteria for options trading on the Exchange pursuant to Rule 4.3.
    \19\ See USS futures contract specifications, available at MSCI 
USA GTR Index Futures (<a href="http://ice.com">ice.com</a>).
---------------------------------------------------------------------------

    The Exchange proposes to base trading in options on the MSCI USA 
Index on a fraction of the full size of the index. In particular, the 
Exchange propose to list MXUSA options that are based on 1/100th of the 
value of the MSCI USA Index. The Exchange believes that listing options 
on the reduced value of the index will attract a greater source of 
customer business than if options were based on the full value of the 
MSCI USA Index. The Exchange further believes that listing options on a 
reduced value of the index may enhance investors' opportunities to 
hedge, or speculate on, the market risk associated with the stocks 
comprising the MSCI USA Index. Additionally, by reducing the value of 
the MSCI USA Index, investors will be able to use this trading vehicle 
while extending a smaller outlay of capital. The Exchange believes this 
may attract additional investors, and, in turn, create a more active 
and liquid trading environment.
Initial and Maintenance Listing Criteria
    The Exchange proposes to apply to each of the MSCI World Index, 
MSCI ACWI Index, and MSCI USA Index the same initial listing criteria 
that currently apply to the MSCI EAFE Index and the MSCI EM Index.\20\ 
Each of the MSCI World Index, the MSCI ACWI Index, and the MSCI USA 
Index satisfies the initial listing criteria currently set forth for 
EAFE and EM options, as set forth in Rule 4.10(h).\21\ Specifically, 
with respect to each of the MSCI World, ACWI, and USA Index:
---------------------------------------------------------------------------

    \20\ See proposed Rule 4.10(h).
    \21\ The initial listing criteria in Rule 4.10(h) also apply to 
the FTSE Emerging Index (FTSE Emerging) and FTSE Developed Europe 
Index (FTSE Developed).

    (1) the index is broad-based, as defined in Rule 4.11; \22\
---------------------------------------------------------------------------

    \22\ Rule 4.11 defines a broad-based index as an index designed 
to be representative of a stock market as a whole or of a range of 
companies in unrelated industries.
---------------------------------------------------------------------------

    (2) options on the index are designated as P.M.-settled index 
options;
    (3) the index is capitalization-weighted, price-weighted, 
modified capitalization-weighted or equal dollar-weighted;
    (4) the index consists of 500 or more component securities;
    (5) all of the component securities of the index will have a 
market capitalization of greater than $100 million
    (6) no single component security accounts for more than 15% of 
the weight of the index,

[[Page 5591]]

and the five highest weighted component securities in the index do 
not, in the aggregate, account for more than 50% of the weight of 
the index;
    (7) non-U.S. component securities (stocks or ADRs) that are not 
subject to comprehensive surveillance agreements do not, in the 
aggregate, represent more than: (A) 25% of the weight of the EAFE 
Index (each of the MSCI World, ACWI, and USA Indexes satisfies this 
criterium), (B) 27.5% of the weight of the EM Index, (C) 32.5% of 
the weight of the FTSE Developed Index, and (D) 35% of the weight of 
the FTSE Emerging Index;
    (8) during the time options on the index are traded on the 
Exchange, the current index value is widely disseminated at least 
once every 15 seconds by one or more major market data vendors; \23\
---------------------------------------------------------------------------

    \23\ This listing criteria permits the Exchange to continue to 
trade EAFE, FTSE Developed, and FTSE Emerging options after trading 
in all component securities has closed for the trading day and the 
index level is no longer widely disseminated at least once every 15 
seconds as long as corresponding futures contracts are still 
trading. This is inapplicable to MXWLD, MXACW, and MXUSA options, as 
the index level for each index will be widely disseminated through 
the end of trading for options on each index.
---------------------------------------------------------------------------

    (9) the Exchange reasonably believes it has adequate system 
capacity to support the trading of options on the index, based on a 
calculation of the Exchange's current Independent System Capacity 
Advisor (ISCA) allocation and the number of new messages per second 
expected to be generated by options on such index; and
    (10) The Exchange has written surveillance procedures in place 
with respect to surveillance of trading of options on the index.

    The Exchange also proposes to subject each of the MSCI World, ACWI, 
and USA Indexes to the maintenance listing standards set forth in Rule 
4.10(i), which currently applies to the MSCI EAFE and EM Indexes: \24\
---------------------------------------------------------------------------

    \24\ The maintenance listing criteria in Rule 4.10(i) also apply 
to the FTSE Emerging Index (FTSE Emerging) and FTSE Developed Europe 
Index (FTSE Developed).

    (1) the conditions stated in paragraphs (1), (2), (3), (4) (8), 
(9), and (10) above must continue to be satisfied; the conditions 
stated in paragraphs (5) and (6) above must be satisfied only as of 
the first day of January and July in each year; and the conditions 
set forth in paragraph (7) must be satisfied as of the first day of 
the month following MSCI's review of the weighting of the 
constituents in the applicable index but in no case less than a 
quarterly basis; and
    (2) the total number of component securities in the index may 
not increase or decrease by more than 35% from the number of 
component securities in the index at the time of its initial 
listing.\25\
---------------------------------------------------------------------------

    \25\ This maintenance criteria applies a 10% threshold rather 
than a 35% threshold to the EM Index. As is the case with other 
index options authorized for listing and trading on Cboe Options, in 
the event the MSCI World Index, MSCI ACWI Index, or MSCI USA Index 
fails to satisfy the maintenance listing standards, the Exchange 
will not open for trading any additional series of options of that 
class unless such failure is determined by the Exchange not to be 
significant and the Commission concurs in that determination, or 
unless the continued listing of that class of index options has been 
approved by the Commission under Section 19(b)(2) of Act.

    Because each of the MSCI World Index, MSCI ACWI Index, and MSCI USA 
Index has a large number of component securities and is based on the 
same methodology as the MSCI EAFE and EM Indexes, as discussed above, 
the Exchange believes it is appropriate for the initial and maintenance 
listing criteria (which require continual and periodic compliance) set 
forth under Rule 4.10(h) and (i) to also apply to the MSCI World, ACWI, 
and USA Index options.
General Trading
    The Exchange proposes that MXWLD, MXACW, and MXUSA options will 
trade during the same hours as other index options, including EAFE and 
EM options. Specifically, the Exchange proposes to adopt Regular 
Trading Hours of 9:30 a.m. to 4:00 p.m. (Eastern time) for MXWLD, 
MXACW, and MXUSA options.\26\
---------------------------------------------------------------------------

    \26\ See proposed Rule 5.1(b)(2)(A).
---------------------------------------------------------------------------

    As proposed, the last trading day for MXUSA options will be the day 
of expiration (from 9:30 a.m. to 4:00 p.m. (Eastern time), pursuant to 
Rule 5.1(b)(2)(A)). As set forth below, the Exchange proposes that 
MXUSA options will be p.m.-settled, which means the exercise settlement 
value of an expiring option is derived from the closing prices of the 
underlying components on the series expiration date. As noted above, 
the MSCI USA Index is comprised of components solely from the United 
States. Therefore, the components of the MSCI USA Index trade from 9:30 
a.m. to 4:00 p.m. (Eastern time), including on the expiration date of 
the proposed MXUSA options. Allowing options to trade through their 
expiration (and thus on their day of expiration) will provide investors 
with the ability to modify their positions in response to changes in 
the prices of the underlying index components that will impact the 
settlement values of those options. This is consistent with the last 
trading day for other options on broad-based p.m.-settled indexes 
comprised of components solely from the United States.\27\
---------------------------------------------------------------------------

    \27\ For example, p.m.-settled options on the S&P 500 Index may 
trade on their expiration dates.
---------------------------------------------------------------------------

    The Exchange proposes to amend Rule 5.1(b)(2)(E) to provide that 
the last trading day for MXWLD and MXACW options will be the business 
day prior to the expiration date of the specific series (from 9:30 a.m. 
to 4:00 p.m. (Eastern time), pursuant to Rule 5.1(b)(2)(A)).\28\ As set 
forth below, the Exchange proposes that MXWLD and MXACW options will be 
p.m.-settled, which means the exercise settlement value of an expiring 
option is derived from the closing prices of the underlying components 
on the series expiration date. As noted above, each of the MSCI World 
Index and MSCI ACWI Index consists of components from 23 countries. 
Because the components of each of these indexes encompass multiple 
markets around the world (unlike the components of the MSCI USA Index, 
all of which trade in the United States and thus during regular U.S. 
trading hours of 9:30 a.m. to 4:00 p.m. (Eastern time)), the components 
are subject to varying trading hours. For each of these indexes, the 
first components open trading at approximately 4:00 p.m. (Eastern time) 
on the prior trading day, and the last components end trading at 
approximately 4:00 p.m. (Eastern time). As a result, trading in various 
components would end prior to the beginning of MXWLD and MXACW Regular 
Trading Hours at 9:30 a.m. (Eastern time).\29\ As a result, the closing 
prices of those components, which are used to determine the exercise 
settlement value, will be determined prior to the time when the 
expiring options may begin trading on the expiration date. This 
increases the risk of providing liquidity in these products on that 
date. Generally, the prices of futures on the MSCI World and ACWI 
Indexes can be a proxy for the current level of the applicable index 
when options on those indexes are trading on the Exchange while the 
index level is not being disseminated. However, that is not the case on 
options' expiration dates, as the prices that will be used to determine 
the exercise settlement value are fixed once trading in the components 
ends, and thus futures trading prices after trading in those components 
end have no bearing on the exercise settlement value. Therefore, the 
Exchange believes it is appropriate to stop trading in expiring MXWLD 
and MXACW options on the business day prior to the expiration date.
---------------------------------------------------------------------------

    \28\ Amendment No. 1 deletes the proposed rule change to add 
MXUSA options to the list of options in Rule 5.1(b)(2)(E). 
Therefore, as proposed in this Amendment No. 1, the last trading day 
for MXUSA options will be the expiration date of the specific 
series.
    \29\ For example, some components end trading at 10:45 p.m. 
(Eastern time) on the prior trading day. Trading in the other 
components ends at various times before and during the U.S. trading 
day.

---------------------------------------------------------------------------

[[Page 5592]]

    Pursuant to Rule 5.3(a), bids and offers on MXWLD, MXACW, and MXUSA 
options (like all other options) must be expressed in terms of dollars 
and decimals per unit of the underlying index. Pursuant to Rule 5.4(a), 
the minimum increment for bids and offers on simple orders for options 
on these three indexes, as is the case for most other index options, 
will be $0.05 if the series trading price is lower than $3.00 and $0.10 
if the series trading price is $3.00 or higher. Rule 5.4(b) provides 
that the minimum increment for bids and offers on complex orders in 
options on these three indexes will be $0.01 or greater (as determined 
by the Exchange) and that the legs may be executed in $0.01 increments.
    MXWLD, MXACW, and MXUSA options will be subject to the same 
procedures for adding and deleting strikes for index options as other 
index options. Specifically, Rule 4.13, Interpretation and Policy .01 
states the procedures for adding and deleting strike prices for index 
options are provided in Rule 4.5 and Interpretations and Policies 
related thereto, as otherwise generally provided by Rule 4.13, and as 
otherwise set forth in Rule 4.13, Interpretation and Policy .01.\30\ 
The Exchange proposes to amend Rule 4.13, Interpretation and Policy 
.01(a) to provide that the interval between strike prices for MXWLD, 
MXACW, and MXUSA options will be no less than $5.00 if the strike price 
is $200 or above, and will be no less than $2.50 if the strike price is 
less than $200.00. This is consistent with the current strike intervals 
of many other index options, including EAFE and EM options.
---------------------------------------------------------------------------

    \30\ These Rules set forth the criteria for listing initial and 
additional series of the same class as the current value of the 
underlying index moves. Generally, additional series must be 
``reasonably related'' to the current index value, which means that 
strike prices must be within 30% of the current index value. New 
series of index option contracts may be added up to the fifth 
business day prior to expiration. Series exceeding the 30% range may 
be listed based on demonstrated customer interest. See Rule 4.13, 
Interpretations and Policies .01 and .04.
---------------------------------------------------------------------------

    Pursuant to Rule 4.20, the Exchange may authorize for trading a 
like flexible (``FLEX'') options class on any index if it may authorize 
for trading a non-FLEX option class on that index pursuant to Rule 
4.10. Therefore, as proposed, the Exchange may authorize for trading 
FLEX Options on the MSCI World Index, MSCI ACWI Index, and MSCI USA 
Index, which the Exchange may authorize for trading pursuant to 
proposed Rule 4.10(h).
    Additionally, Rule 5.6(c) permits Multi-Class Spread Orders, which 
are orders to buy a stated number of contracts of a broad-based index 
option and to sell an equal number, or an equivalent number, of 
contracts of a related broad-based index option. For purposes of Multi-
Class Spread Orders, a ``broad-based index option'' is an option on a 
broad-based index, ETF, or exchange-traded note (``ETN'') listed in 
subparagraph (1) of the definition of Multi-Class Spread Order in Rule 
5.6(c) or any other broad-based index or ETF or ETN derived from a 
broad-based index the Exchange determines creates an appropriate hedge 
with any other broad-based index option. The Exchange proposes to add 
MSCI World Index and MSCI ACWI Index, as well as corresponding ETFs 
URTH and ACWI, and the combinations of MXWLD and URTH options and MXACW 
and ACWI options to the list of permissible Multi-Class Spread Orders, 
as the Exchange has determined that these combinations create 
appropriate hedges (as do other MSCI options and corresponding ETF 
options).
Expiration Months, Settlement, and Exercise Style
    Consistent with existing rules for other index options, including 
EAFE and EM options, the Exchange will allow up to twelve near-term 
expiration months for each of MXWLD, MXACW, and MXUSA options \31\ as 
well as LEAPS.\32\ These indexes would also be eligible for all other 
expirations permitted for other broad-based indexes, including 
Quarterly Index Expirations \33\ and Weekly and End of Month 
Expirations.\34\ Given that the MSCI World, ACWI, and USA Indexes are 
broad-based indexes and based on the same methodology as the MSCI EAFE 
and EM Indexes, as noted above, the Exchange believes it is appropriate 
for options on these three indexes to be eligible for the same 
expirations for which the options on other broad-based indexes, 
including MSCI EAFE and EM Indexes, are eligible under current rules.
---------------------------------------------------------------------------

    \31\ See proposed Rule 4.13(a)(2).
    \32\ Pursuant to Rule 4.13(b)(1), the Exchange may list up to 10 
expiration months of long-term index option series (``LEAPS'') that 
expire from 12 to 180 months from the date of issuance.
    \33\ See Rule 4.13(c).
    \34\ See Rule 4.13(e).
---------------------------------------------------------------------------

    MXWLD, MXACW, and MXUSA options will be P.M.-, cash-settled 
contracts with European-style exercise.\35\ The Exchange believes that 
P.M.-settlement is appropriate for MXWLD and MXACW options due to the 
natures of the underlying indexes that encompass multiple markets 
around the world. The components of each index open with the start of 
trading in certain parts of Asia at approximately 4:00 p.m. (Eastern 
time) (prior day) and close with the end of trading in North America at 
approximately 4:00 p.m. (Eastern time) (next day) as closing prices 
from North American countries are accounted for in the closing 
calculation. The Exchange further believes that P.M.-settlement is 
appropriate for MXWLD and MXACW options, as well as MXUSA options, 
because the Exchange understands that investors prefer to be able to 
trade out of positions during the entire final day of trading. The 
Exchange notes the Commission recently approved proposals to make other 
pilots permitting P.M.-settlement of index options permanent after 
finding those pilots were consistent with the Act and the options 
subject to those pilots had no significant impact on the market.\36\ 
Rule 4.13(e) currently permits the Exchange to list P.M.-settled weekly 
and end-of-month expirations for all broad-based index options, which 
would include MXWLD, MXACW, and MXUSA options.
---------------------------------------------------------------------------

    \35\ See Proposed Rule 4.13(a)(3).
    \36\ See Securities Exchange Act Release Nos. 98454 (September 
20, 2023) (SR-CBOE-2023-005) (order approving proposed rule change 
to make permanent the operation of a program that allows the 
Exchange to list p.m.-settled third Friday-of-the-month SPX options 
series); 98455 (September 20, 2023) (SR-CBOE-2023-019) (order 
approving proposed rule change to make permanent the operation of a 
program that allows the Exchange to list p.m.-settled third Friday-
of-the-month XSP and MRUT options series); and 98456 (September 20, 
2023) (SR-CBOE-2023-020) (order approving proposed rule change to 
make the nonstandard expirations pilot program permanent).
---------------------------------------------------------------------------

    The Exchange proposes to amend Rule 4.13(a)(3) to add MXWLD, MXACW, 
and MXUSA options to the list of other European-style (and P.M.-
settled) index options. European-style (and P.M.-settled) exercise is 
consistent with many index options, as set forth in Rule 4.13(a)(3). 
EAFE and EM options are also P.M.-settled with European-style exercise. 
Given that the MSCI World, ACWI, and USA Indexes are broad-based 
indexes and based on the same methodology as the MSCI EAFE and EM 
Indexes, as noted above, the Exchange believes it is appropriate for 
options on these three indexes to have the same settlement and exercise 
style as the other MSCI Index options.
    Like other index options, the exercise settlement amount of MXWLD, 
MXACW, and MXUSA options will be equal to the difference between the 
exercise settlement value (with respect to MXWLD and MXUSA options, 1/
100th of the official closing value of the MSCI World Index and MSCI 
USA Index, respectively, and, with respect to MXACW options, the 
official closing value of the MSCI ACWI Index, each as

[[Page 5593]]

reported by the reporting authority on the day on which the index 
option contract is exercised) and the exercise price of the option 
(multiplied by the contract multiplier of $100).\37\
---------------------------------------------------------------------------

    \37\ See Rule 4.13, Interpretation and Policy .05. If the 
exercise settlement value is not available or the normal settlement 
procedure cannot be utilized due to a trading disruption or other 
unusual circumstance, the settlement value would be determined in 
accordance with the rules and bylaws of The Options Clearing 
Corporation (``OCC''). See OCC Bylaws, Article XVII, Section 4.
---------------------------------------------------------------------------

Position and Exercise Limits
    The Exchange proposes to amend Rule 8.31(a) to apply a position 
limit of 50,000 contracts (with no restrictions) to MXWLD, MXACW, and 
MXUSA options.\38\ This is the same position limit that currently 
exists for many other broad-based index options, including EAFE and EM 
options.\39\ Pursuant to Rule 8.42(b), the exercise limit for these 
options will be equivalent to the proposed position limit of 50,000 
contracts. As set forth in Rule 8.31(d), positions in MXWLD options and 
MXUSA options (which are proposed to be reduced-value index options) 
will be aggregated with positions in full-value indexes.\40\ All 
position limit hedge exemptions would apply.
---------------------------------------------------------------------------

    \38\ Additionally, the Exchange proposes to amend Rule 
8.35(a)(6) to provide that, like FLEX Options on the MSCI EAFE Index 
and MSCI EM Index, the position limits for FLEX options on the MSCI 
World Index, MSCI ACWI Index, and MSCI USA Index are equal to the 
position limits for the non-FLEX options on these indexes (which is 
50,000 contracts, as proposed). Pursuant to Rule 8.42(g), the 
exercise limit for FLEX index options (which would include FLEX 
options on the MSCI World, ACWI, and USA Indexes) will be equivalent 
to the FLEX position limits prescribed in Rule 8.35(a)(6). As set 
forth in Rule 8.35(b), in calculating the applicable contract 
reporting amount for that rule, reduced-value contracts (such as the 
proposed MXWLD and MXUSA options) will be aggregated with full-value 
contracts and counted by the amount by which they equal a full-value 
contract.
    \39\ See Rule 8.31(a).
    \40\ For example, if an index is reduced by one-tenth, 10 
reduced-value contracts equal one contract. If an index is reduced 
by 1/100, 100 reduced-value contracts will equal one contract. See 
Rule 8.31(d). The Exchange notes it currently does not list, nor 
plan to list, options on the full value of the MSCI World Index or 
MSCI USA Index.
---------------------------------------------------------------------------

Margin
    MXWLD, MXACW, and MXUSA options will be margined as ``broad-based 
index'' options. Under the Exchange's Rules, particularly Rule 
10.3(c)(5)(A), the margin requirement for a short put or call will be 
100% of the current market value of the contract plus 15% of the 
``product of the current index group value and the applicable index 
multiplier,'' reduced by any out-of-the-money amount. There would be a 
minimum margin requirement of 100% of the current market value of the 
contract plus: 10% of the aggregate put exercise price amount in the 
case of puts, and 10% of the product of the current index group value 
and the applicable index multiplier in the case of calls. Additional 
margin may be required under the Rules, including pursuant to Rules 
10.3(h) and 10.10.
Surveillance and Capacity
    The Exchange represents that it has an adequate surveillance 
program in place for MXWLD, MXACW, and MXUSA options and intends to use 
the same surveillance procedures currently utilized for each of the 
Exchange's other index options to monitor trading in these options. The 
Exchange is a member of the Intermarket Surveillance Group (``ISG''), 
along with numerous other self-regulatory bodies across the world. ISG 
provides a framework for sharing information and coordinating 
regulatory efforts among exchanges trading securities and related 
products.\41\ The Exchange is also an affiliate member of the 
International Organization of Securities Commissions (``IOSCO''), which 
has members from over 100 different countries. Each of the countries 
from which there is a component security in both the MSCI EAFE and MSCI 
EM Indexes is a member of IOSCO.\42\ Finally, the Exchange has entered 
into various comprehensive surveillance agreements (``CSAs'') and/or 
Memoranda of Understanding with various stock exchanges. Given the 
capitalization of the EAFE and EM Indexes and the deep and liquid 
markets for the securities underlying these Indexes, the concerns for 
market manipulation and/or disruption in the underlying markets are 
greatly reduced.
---------------------------------------------------------------------------

    \41\ See list of current ISG members, available at Search 
Results--Members--isg (<a href="http://isgportal.org">isgportal.org</a>).
    \42\ See list of current ordinary IOSCO members, available at 
<a href="http://www.iosco.org/about/?subsection=membership&memid=1">http://www.iosco.org/about/?subsection=membership&memid=1</a>. There are 
three categories of IOSCO members: ordinary, associate and 
affiliate. In general, the ordinary members (124) are the national 
securities commissions in their respective jurisdictions. Associate 
members (12) are usually agencies or branches of government, other 
than the principal national securities regulator in their respective 
jurisdictions that have some regulatory competence over securities 
markets, or intergovernmental international organizations and other 
international standard-setting bodies, such as the IMF and the World 
Bank, with a mission related to either the development or the 
regulation of securities markets. Affiliate members (62) are self-
regulatory organizations, stock exchanges, financial market 
infrastructures, investor protection funds and compensation funds, 
and other bodies with an appropriate interest in securities 
regulation. See IOSCO Fact Sheet, available at <a href="http://www.iosco.org/about/pdf/IOSCO-Fact-Sheet.pdf">http://www.iosco.org/about/pdf/IOSCO-Fact-Sheet.pdf</a>.
---------------------------------------------------------------------------

    The Exchange has analyzed its capacity and represents that it 
believes the Exchange and the Options Price Reporting Authority 
(``OPRA'') have the necessary systems capacity to handle the additional 
traffic associated with the listing of new series that would result 
from the introduction of MXWLD, MXACW, and MXUSA options. Because the 
proposal is limited to three classes, the Exchange believes any 
additional traffic that would be generated from the introduction of the 
MSCI World, ACWI, and USA Index options would be manageable.
2. Statutory Basis
    The Exchange believes the proposed rule change is consistent with 
the Act and the rules and regulations thereunder applicable to the 
Exchange and, in particular, the requirements of Section 6(b) of the 
Act.\43\ Specifically, the Exchange believes the proposed rule change 
is consistent with the Section 6(b)(5) \44\ requirements that the rules 
of an exchange be designed to prevent fraudulent and manipulative acts 
and practices, to promote just and equitable principles of trade, to 
foster cooperation and coordination with persons engaged in regulating, 
clearing, settling, processing information with respect to, and 
facilitating transactions in securities, to remove impediments to and 
perfect the mechanism of a free and open market and a national market 
system, and, in general, to protect investors and the public interest. 
Additionally, the Exchange believes the proposed rule change is 
consistent with the Section 6(b)(5) \45\ requirement that the rules of 
an exchange not be designed to permit unfair discrimination between 
customers, issuers, brokers, or dealers.

---------------------------------------------------------------------------

    In particular, the Exchange believes that the proposal to permit 
the Exchange to list and trade options on each of the MSCI World Index, 
the MSCI ACWI Index, and the MSCI USA Index will remove impediments to 
and perfect the mechanism of a free and open market and a national 
market system, and, in general, protect investors and the public 
interest, because the proposed rule change will introduce new index 
option products to the marketplace. As a result, investors will have 
additional and different opportunities to hedge or speculate on the 
market risk associated with these indexes by offering exchange-listed 
options directly on the indexes. Further, the proposed rule change is 
consistent with current Rules, which were previously approved by the

[[Page 5594]]

Commission.\46\ Specifically, each of MSCI World Index, MSCI ACWI 
Index, and MSCI USA Index satisfies the same initial listing criteria 
as four other broad-based indexes on which the Exchange is currently 
permitted to list options.\47\ These indexes will also be subject to 
the same maintenance criteria as these other broad-based indexes.\48\ 
These include the MSCI EAFE Index and MSCI EM Index, each of which is 
calculated using the same methodology as the MSCI World Index, MSCI 
ACWI Index, and MSCI USA Index.\49\ Additionally, the proposed index 
options will be subject to the same rules regarding trading hours,\50\ 
trading increments, the number of permissible expirations, strike 
intervals, settlement, and exercise style that apply to other currently 
listed broad-based index options, including EAFE and EM options.\51\ 
The Exchange has observed no trading or capacity issues in EAFE or EM 
option trading given the number of permissible expirations, p.m.-
settlement, and European-style exercise. Given the similarities of 
these indexes and the MSCI World Index, MSCI ACWI Index, and MSCI USA 
Index, including that there are other products available in the market 
on the same indexes, the Exchange believes it is reasonable and 
appropriate to list options on these indexes with similar terms as EAFE 
and EM options. The Exchange believes this will benefit investors, as 
it will provide market participants with additional investment and 
hedging strategies consisting of options over each of these indexes.
---------------------------------------------------------------------------

    \46\ See MSCI EAFE and EM Approval.
    \47\ See current Rule 4.10(h).
    \48\ See current Rule 4.10(i).
    \49\ These indexes also have the same reporting authority as the 
MSCI EAFE Index and MSCI EM Index.
    \50\ As discussed above and below, the proposed last trading of 
expiring MXWLD and MXACW options will be the day prior to 
expiration, as is the case for EAFE and EM options, while the 
proposed last trading day of expiring MXUSA options will be the day 
of expiration, as is the case for p.m.-settled options overlying 
broad-based index options comprised solely of U.S. components.
    \51\ See Rules 4.13 (including paragraphs (a)(2) and (3), (b), 
(c) and (e) and Interpretation and Policy .01), 5.1(b)(2), 5.3(a), 
and 5.4.
---------------------------------------------------------------------------

    The Exchange believes the proposed rule changes regarding the last 
day of trading for MXWLD, MXACW, and MXUSA options will remove 
impediments to and perfect the mechanism of a free and open market and 
benefit investors. The Exchange understands that Market-Makers and 
other liquidity providers will generally price these options using the 
disseminated index values and data from the markets on which the 
components trade (as they do for EAFE and EM options). As noted above, 
when these markets are not trading during U.S. trading hours, these 
liquidity providers can price the options using prices of futures 
trading on the MSCI World and ACWI Indexes. While those futures prices 
can serve as a proxy for the index value, they would not be able to 
serve as a proxy for the settlement value on the expiration date for 
MXWLD and MXACW options. This is because the futures pricing is 
intended to represent the then-current index value, but does not 
incorporate the closing prices of the components that will be used to 
determine the settlement value. This would create risk for Market-
Makers and other liquidity providers, as they would have no data they 
can use to price the expiring options based on the ultimate settlement 
value. This could result in trades at prices inconsistent with the 
settlement value of those options. The Exchange believes the proposed 
rule change will remove impediments to and perfect the mechanism of a 
free and open market by eliminating this pricing risk for liquidity 
providers on the last trading day of expiring series in these products 
and may provide more competitive pricing and additional trading 
opportunities for expiring series, which ultimately benefits investors. 
Other options stop trading on the business day preceding 
expiration.\52\
---------------------------------------------------------------------------

    \52\ See, e.g., Rule 5.1(b)(2)(E) (pursuant to which the last 
trading day for EAFE and EM options will be the business day prior 
to the expiration date of the specific series).
---------------------------------------------------------------------------

    The Exchange proposes that the last day of trading for MXUSA 
options will be their expiration dates, like most p.m.-settled options 
the Exchange lists. Unlike the MSCI World and ACWI Indexes, all of the 
components of the MSCI USA Index trade on U.S. markets. Thus, the 
prices of those components will be changing on the expiration date of 
MXUSA options from 9:30 a.m. to 4:00 p.m. (Eastern time) on the 
options' expiration dates. As noted above, the Exchange understands 
that Market-Makers and other liquidity providers will generally price 
these options using the disseminated index values and data from the 
markets on which the components trade. With respect to the MSCI USA 
Index, its underlying components will be trading from 9:30 a.m. to 4:00 
p.m. (Eastern time) on the expiration date of MXUSA options, and thus 
up until the time (4:00 p.m. (Eastern time)) when MSCI will disseminate 
the closing value of the index. Permitting trading on the expiration 
date for the MXUSA options will allow Market-Makers and other liquidity 
providers to update the prices of expiring options in response to 
changes in the prices of the index components on that date, which 
changes will be incorporated into the settlement value of those 
options. The Exchange believes the proposed rule change will remove 
impediments to and perfect the mechanism of a free and open market by 
encouraging liquidity providers to provide more competitive pricing and 
additional trading opportunities for expiring series at prices that 
reflect the then-current value of the index and its components. 
Additionally, permitting trading in MXUSA options on their expiration 
dates will permit investors to be able to trade out of positions in 
response to pricing changes of those components during the entire final 
day of trading before the options' settlement. Other p.m.-settled index 
options stop trading on their expiration dates.\53\
---------------------------------------------------------------------------

    \53\ See, e.g., Rule 5.1(b)(2)(C) (pursuant to which the last 
trading day for SPX options is the expiration date of the specific 
series).
---------------------------------------------------------------------------

    The Exchange believes offering options on a reduced value of each 
of the MSCI World Index and MSCI USA Index will benefit investors, as 
it will attract a greater source of customer business than if options 
were based on the full value of those indexes.\54\ The Exchange further 
believes that listing options on a reduced value of the index may 
enhance investors' opportunities to hedge, or speculate on, the market 
risk associated with the stocks comprising the MSCI World Index and 
MSCI USA Index. Additionally, by reducing the value of the MSCI World 
Index and MSCI USA Index, investors will be able to use this trading 
vehicle while extending a smaller outlay of capital. The Exchange 
believes this may attract additional investors, and, in turn, create a 
more active and liquid trading environment.
---------------------------------------------------------------------------

    \54\ At the close of trading on January 8, 2024, the value of 
the MSCI World Index was 3153.60, and the value of the MSCI USA 
Index was 4,541.61. For comparison, the value of the MSCI ACWI Index 
was 720.07. The Exchange currently has authority to list several 
reduced-value index options (particularly on indexes with values of 
1,000 or more), such as the S&P 500 Index and the Russell 2000 
Index. See Rule 4.13, Interpretation and Policy .06.
---------------------------------------------------------------------------

    The Exchange also believes the proposed rule change is consistent 
with Section 6(b)(1) of the Act,\55\ which provides that the Exchange 
be organized and have the capacity to be able to carry out the purposes 
of the Act and to enforce compliance by the Exchange's Trading Permit 
Holders (``TPHs'') and persons associated with its TPHs with the Act, 
the rules and regulations

[[Page 5595]]

thereunder, and the rules of the Exchange. The Exchange represents that 
it has the necessary systems capacity to support the new option series 
given these proposed specifications. The Exchange believes the existing 
surveillance procedures and reporting requirements at the Exchange and 
other self-regulatory organizations are capable of properly identifying 
disruptive and/or manipulative trading activity that may arise from 
listing and trading MXWLD, MXACW, and MXUSA options. The Exchange also 
represents it has adequate surveillances in place to detect potential 
manipulation, as well as reviews in place to identify potential changes 
in composition of the underlying indexes and continued compliance with 
the Exchange's listing standards. These procedures utilize daily 
monitoring of market activity via automated surveillance techniques to 
identify unusual activity in both options and the underlyings, as 
applicable.\56\ The Exchange also notes that large stock holdings must 
be disclosed to the Commission by way of Schedules 13D or 13G,\57\ 
which are used to report ownership of stock which exceeds 5% of a 
company's total stock issue and may assist in providing information in 
monitoring for any potential manipulative schemes.
---------------------------------------------------------------------------

    \55\ 15 U.S.C. 78f(b)(1).
    \56\ The Exchange believes these procedures have been effective 
for the surveillance of trading other broad-based index options, 
including EAFE and EM options, and will continue to employ them with 
respect to MXWLD, MXACW, and MXUSA options.
    \57\ 17 CFR 240.13d-1.
---------------------------------------------------------------------------

    Additionally, the proposed position and exercise limits that would 
apply to MXWLD, MXACW, and MXUSA options are similar to the current 
position and exercise limits that apply to other broad-based index 
options, and the same as those that apply to EAFE and EM options. The 
Exchange further notes that current Rules that apply to the trading of 
other index options traded on the Exchange, such as EAFE and EM 
options, would also apply to the trading of MXWLD, MXACW, and MXUSA 
options, such as, for example, Rules governing customer accounts, 
margin requirements, and trading halt procedures. The proposed index 
options would be subject to the same reporting requirements as other 
index options, which require that each TPH or TPH organization that 
maintains positions in the options on the same side of the market, for 
its own account or for the account of a customer, report certain 
information to the Exchange. This information would include, but would 
not be limited to, the options' positions, whether such positions are 
hedged and, if so, a description of the hedge(s). Market-Makers \58\ 
(including Designated Primary Market-Makers (``DPMs'')) \59\ would 
continue to be exempt from this reporting requirement, however, the 
Exchange may access Market-Maker position information.\60\ Moreover, 
the Exchange's requirement that TPHs file reports with the Exchange for 
any customer who held aggregate large long or short positions on the 
same side of the market of 200 or more options contracts of any single 
class for the previous day will remain at this level for the options 
subject to this proposal and will continue to serve as an important 
part of the Exchange's surveillance efforts.\61\
---------------------------------------------------------------------------

    \58\ A Market-Maker ``Trading Permit Holder registered with the 
Exchange pursuant to Rule 3.52 for the purpose of making markets in 
option contracts traded on the Exchange and that has the rights and 
responsibilities set forth in Chapter 5, Section D of the Rules.'' 
See Rule 1.1.
    \59\ A DPM is a TPH organization that is approved by the 
Exchange to function in allocated securities as a Market-Maker (as 
defined in Rule 8.1) and is subject to the obligations under Rule 
5.54 or as otherwise provided under the rules of the Exchange. See 
Rule 1.1.
    \60\ The Options Clearing Corporation (``OCC'') through the 
Large Option Position Reporting (``LOPR'') system acts as a 
centralized service provider for TPH compliance with position 
reporting requirements by collecting data from each TPH or TPH 
organization, consolidating the information, and ultimately 
providing detailed listings of each TPH's report to the Exchange, as 
well as Financial Industry Regulatory Authority, Inc. (``FINRA''), 
acting as its agent pursuant to a regulatory services agreement 
(``RSA'').
    \61\ See Rule 8.43 for reporting requirements.
---------------------------------------------------------------------------

    The Exchange believes the current financial requirements imposed by 
the Exchange and by the Commission adequately address concerns 
regarding potentially large, unhedged positions on index options, 
further promoting just and equitable principles of trading and the 
maintenance of a fair and orderly market. Current margin and risk-based 
haircut methodologies serve to limit the size of positions maintained 
by any one account by increasing the margin and/or capital that a TPH 
must maintain for a large position held by itself or by its 
customer.\62\ In addition, Rule 15c3-1 \63\ imposes a capital charge on 
TPHs to the extent of any margin deficiency resulting from the higher 
margin requirement.

B. Self-Regulatory Organization's Statement on Burden on Competition

    The Exchange does not believe that the proposed rule change will 
impose any burden on competition that is not necessary or appropriate 
in furtherance of the purposes of the Act. The Exchange does not 
believe that the proposed rule change will impose any burden on 
intramarket competition that is not necessary or appropriate in 
furtherance of the purposes of the Act, because MXWLD, MXACW, and MXUSA 
options will be available to all market participants and will trade in 
the same manner as other index options in accordance with the 
Exchange's Rules.
    The Exchange does not believe that the proposed rule change will 
impose any burden on intermarket competition that is not necessary or 
appropriate in furtherance of the purposes of the Act, and instead 
believes the proposed rule change will enhance competition among market 
participants by introducing new index options to the market that may 
compete with other products currently available in the market (such as 
U.S.- and European-traded derivatives on the same indexes). As 
discussed above, the MSCI World Index, MSCI ACWI Index, and MSCI USA 
Index each satisfies the same initial listing criteria that currently 
applies to the MSCI EAFE Index and MSCI EM Index (as well as the FTSE 
Developed and FTSE Emerging Index). Additionally, the proposed terms of 
these index options (including the number of expirations, settlement, 
and exercise style) are consistent with current rules applicable to 
many other broad-based index options.

C. Self-Regulatory Organization's Statement on Comments on the Proposed 
Rule Change Received From Members, Participants, or Others

    The Exchange neither solicited nor received comments on the 
proposed rule change.

III. Date of Effectiveness of the Proposed Rule Change and Timing for 
Commission Action

    Within 45 days of the date of publication of this notice in the 
Federal Register or within such longer period up to 90 days (i) as the 
Commission may designate if it finds such longer period to be

which the Exchange consents, the Commission will:
    A. by order approve or disapprove such proposed rule change, or
    B. institute proceedings to determine whether the proposed rule 
change should be disapproved.

IV. Solicitation of Comments

    Interested persons are invited to submit written data, views and 
arguments concerning the foregoing, including whether the proposed rule 
change, as modified by Amendment No. 1, is consistent with the Act.
