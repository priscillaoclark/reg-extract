I. Self-Regulatory Organization's Statement of the Terms of Substance 
of the Proposed Rule Change

    The Exchange proposes amendments to Rule 7.35 (General) and Rule 
7.35B (DMM-Facilitated Closing Auctions) to align the definition of 
Imbalance Reference Price for a Closing Imbalance; replace the 
Regulatory Closing Imbalance with an enhanced Significant Closing 
Imbalance; and include Closing D Orders in the Total Imbalance 
calculation ten minutes before the scheduled end of Core Trading Hours. 
The proposed rule change is available on the Exchange's website at 
<a href="http://www.nyse.com">www.nyse.com</a>, at the principal office of the Exchange, and at the 
Commission's Public Reference Room.

II. Self-Regulatory Organization's Statement of the Purpose of, and 
Statutory Basis for, the Proposed Rule Change

    In its filing with the Commission, the self-regulatory organization 
included statements concerning the purpose of, and basis for, the 
proposed rule change and discussed any comments it received on the 
proposed rule change. The text of those statements may be examined at 
the places specified in Item IV below. The Exchange has prepared 
summaries, set forth in sections A, B, and C below, of the most 
significant parts of such statements.

A. Self-Regulatory Organization's Statement of the Purpose of, and the 
Statutory Basis for, the Proposed Rule Change

1. Purpose
    The exchange proposes amendments to Rule 7.35 (General) and Rule 
7.35B (DMM-Facilitated Closing Auctions) to align the definition of 
Imbalance Reference Price for a Closing Imbalance; replace the 
Regulatory Closing Imbalance with an enhanced Significant Closing 
Imbalance; and include Closing D Orders in the Total Imbalance 
calculation ten minutes before the scheduled end of Core Trading Hours.
    The proposed changes would enhance the imbalance information that 
the Exchange publishes going into the Closing Auction, thereby 
promoting greater transparency in the Closing Auction process and the 
Exchange's marketplace. Specifically, the Exchange would replace the 
Regulatory Closing Imbalance publication based on static criteria with 
a ``Significant Closing Imbalance'' based on elastic criteria based on 
the recent average close size of the security and the notional value of 
the imbalance. Similarly, the Exchange would include Closing D Orders 
in the Closing Auction Imbalance Information at their undisplayed 
discretionary price ten minutes before the end of Core Trading Hours, 
five minutes earlier than currently. The proposed change would also be 
reflected in the definition of Paired and Unpaired Quantity, which for 
the Closing Auction would include Closing D Orders ten minutes before 
the scheduled end of Core Trading Hours.
    Finally, the Exchange would align the definition of ``Imbalance 
Reference Price'' for a Closing Imbalance with that utilized for 
Imbalance Reference Price for the Closing Auction Imbalance Information 
in Rule 7.35B(e)(3).
Background
    Imbalance information on the Exchange means better-priced orders on 
one side of the market compared to both better-priced and at-price 
orders on the other side of the market. The Exchange disseminates two 
types of Imbalance publications: Total Imbalance and Closing Imbalance. 
Total Imbalance information is disseminated for all Auctions, and 
Closing Imbalance information is disseminated for the Closing Auction 
only.
    Beginning ten minutes before the scheduled end of Core Trading 
Hours, the Exchange begins disseminating through its proprietary data 
feed Closing Auction Imbalance Information that is calculated based on 
the interest eligible

[[Page 19371]]

to participate in the Closing Auction.\4\ The Closing Auction Imbalance 
Information includes the Continuous Book Clearing Price, which is the 
price at which all better-priced orders eligible to trade in the 
Closing Auction on the Side of the Imbalance can be traded.\5\ The 
Closing Auction Imbalance Information also includes an Imbalance 
Reference Price, which is the Exchange Last Sale Price bound by the 
Exchange BBO.\6\
---------------------------------------------------------------------------

    \4\ See Rule 7.35B(e)(1)(A). DMM Orders, as defined in Rule 
7.35(a)(9)(B), that have been entered by the DMM in advance of a 
Closing Auction are currently included in the Closing Auction 
Imbalance Information.
    \5\ See Rule 7.35(a)(4)(C). In the case of a buy Imbalance, the 
Continuous Book Clearing Price would be the highest potential 
Closing Auction Price and in the case of a sell Imbalance, the 
Continuous Book Clearing Price would be the lowest potential Closing 
Auction Price.
    \6\ See Rule 7.35B(e)(3).
---------------------------------------------------------------------------

    Beginning five minutes before the end of Core Trading Hours, 
Closing D Orders are included in the Closing Auction Imbalance 
Information at their undisplayed discretionary price.\7\ The Closing 
Auction Imbalance Information is updated at least every second, unless 
there is no change to the information, and is disseminated until the 
Closing Auction begins.\8\ In addition, if at the Closing Auction 
Imbalance Freeze Time (e.g., 3:50 p.m. Eastern Time) \9\ the Closing 
Imbalance \10\ is 500 round lots or more, the Exchange will disseminate 
a Regulatory Closing Imbalance to both the securities information 
processor and proprietary data feeds.\11\
---------------------------------------------------------------------------

    \7\ See Rule 7.35(b)(1)(C)(ii).
    \8\ See Rule 7.35(c)(1) and (2).
    \9\ See Rule 7.35(a)(8) (defining the ``Closing Auction 
Imbalance Freeze Time'' to be 10 minutes before the scheduled end of 
Core Trading Hours).
    \10\ As defined in Rule 7.35(a)(4)(A)(ii), a ``Closing 
Imbalance'' means the Imbalance of MOC and LOC Orders to buy and MOC 
and LOC Orders to sell. Rule 7.35(a)(4)(A)(ii) further defines a 
``Regulatory Closing Imbalance'' as a Closing Imbalance disseminated 
at or after the Closing Auction Imbalance Freeze Time.
    \11\ See Rule 7.35B(d)(1).
---------------------------------------------------------------------------

Proposed Rule Change
    The proposed amendments to Rule 7.35 and Rule 7.35B are the latest 
in a series of enhancements the Exchange has made to the transparency 
of its marketplace since 2008.\12\ As noted, the proposal would enhance 
the imbalance information that the Exchange publishes going into the 
Closing Auction, one of the most critical periods in the trading day. 
The Exchange's Closing Auction is a recognized industry reference 
point,\13\ and member organizations and the investing public receive 
substantial benefits from increased liquidity at the close and high 
levels of executions at the Exchange's closing price on a daily basis. 
Indeed, given today's fragmented marketplace,\14\ the centralized 
liquidity available during the Closing Auction is essential for price 
discovery and the stability and transparency of the marketplace.
---------------------------------------------------------------------------

    \12\ In 2010, the Exchange began disseminating Closing Auction 
Imbalance Information beginning ten minutes before the scheduled end 
of Core Trading Hours, which provides updated imbalance information 
and indicative closing prices. See Securities Exchange Act Release 
No. 61233 (December 23, 2009), 74 FR 69169 (December 30, 2009) (SR-
NYSE-2009-111) (Approval Order) (``Closing Filing''). See also 
Securities Exchange Act Release No. 61616 (March 1, 2010), 75 FR 
10533 (March 8, 2010) (SR-NYSE-2010-12) (Notice of Filing of 
Extension of Implementation Date of the Closing Filing). In 2019, in 
connection with the transition to the Pillar trading platform, the 
Exchange amended its rules to include Floor Broker Interest (i.e., 
interest verbalized in the trading crowd by a Floor broker) in 
Closing Auction Imbalance Information. In 2020, the Exchange 
temporarily suspended the availability of Floor Broker Interest to 
be eligible to participate in the Closing Auction, as defined in 
Rule 7.35, and in 2021, permanently excluded Floor Broker Interest 
from the Closing Auction and required all Floor brokers to enter 
orders for the Closing Auction electronically during Core Trading 
Hours. See Securities Exchange Act Release No. 92480 (July 23, 
2021), 86 FR 40886 (July 29, 2021) (SR-NYSE-2020-95). In 2022, the 
Exchange made further changes to the Closing Auction, including 
adding price parameters within which the DMM must select a Closing 
Auction Price, in order to make the Closing Auction more transparent 
and deterministic. See Securities Exchange Act Release No. 95691 
(September 7, 2022), 87 FR 56099 (September 13, 2022) (SR-NYSE-2022-
32).
    \13\ For example, the pricing and valuation of certain indices, 
funds, and derivative products require primary market prints.
    \14\ While Regulation NMS has enhanced competition, it has also 
fostered a ``fragmented'' market structure where trading in a single 
stock can occur across multiple trading centers. When multiple 
trading centers compete for order flow in the same stock, the 
Commission has recognized that ``such competition can lead to the 
fragmentation of order flow in that stock.'' See Securities Exchange 
Act Release No. 61358, 75 FR 3594, 3597 (January 21, 2010) (File No. 
S7-02-10) (Concept Release on Equity Market Structure).
---------------------------------------------------------------------------

Significant Closing Imbalance
    The Exchange currently publishes a Regulatory Closing Imbalance at 
the Closing Auction Imbalance Freeze Time if the Closing Imbalance is 
500 round lots or more. The Exchange would retire the Regulatory 
Closing Imbalance based on a static round-lot trigger and instead 
publish a Significant Closing Imbalance based on a dynamic formula that 
would consider the notional size of the imbalance and the recent 
closing activity of the relevant security. As proposed, unless 
determined otherwise by the Exchange and announced by Trader Update, a 
Closing Imbalance would be considered ``Significant'' if:
    <bullet> the Closing Imbalance is equal to or greater than 30 
percent of the 20-day Average Closing Size for NYSE-listed securities 
in the S&P 500[supreg] Index; 50 percent of the 20-day Average Closing 
Size for securities in the S&P 400[supreg] Index and the S&P 
600[supreg] Index; or 70 percent of the 20-day Average Closing Size for 
all other securities,\15\ and
---------------------------------------------------------------------------

    \15\ See proposed Rule 7.35B(d)(1)(A).
---------------------------------------------------------------------------

    <bullet> the notional value of the Closing Imbalance, calculated as 
the product of the imbalance quantity and the reference price, is equal 
to or greater than $200,000 for S&P and all other securities.\16\
---------------------------------------------------------------------------

    \16\ See id. at (B).
---------------------------------------------------------------------------

    For purposes of calculating the proposed Significant Closing 
Imbalance, Average Closing Size will be calculated for each symbol 
based on the most recent 20 trading days where the security closed on a 
last sale eligible trade. For securities with less than the specified 
trading data, including but not limited to IPOs, direct listings, and 
transfers, the Closing Imbalance will be considered Significant if the 
notional value of the Closing Imbalance, calculated as the product of 
the imbalance quantity and the reference price, is equal to or greater 
than $200,000 for S&P and all other securities or an alternative 
specified dollar amount as determined by the Exchange and announced by 
Trader Update. Only trading days with an NYSE close will be considered 
for purposes of the Significant Closing Imbalance calculation.\17\
---------------------------------------------------------------------------

    \17\ See id. at (C).
---------------------------------------------------------------------------

    For example, assume that XYZ is an S&P 400[supreg] Index stock with 
a closing imbalance of 35,000 shares and a reference price of $10.00. 
Assuming that the 20-day Average Closing Size for XYZ is 100,000 
shares, the imbalance would be considered Significant because the 
current imbalance of 35,000 shares is greater than 30,000 shares, which 
represents 30% of the 100,000 shares, and the notional value of 
$350,000 (35,000 shares multiplied by $10.00) is greater than $200,000. 
However, if XYZ was a non-S&P Index security, the same imbalance would 
not be considered significant because the 35,000 share imbalance would 
be less than 70,000 shares, or 70% of 100,000.
    To effectuate these changes, the Exchange would replace 
``Regulatory'' with ``Significant'' in Rules 7.35 and 7.35B where the 
phrase ``Regulatory Closing Imbalance'' appears, i.e., in Rule 
7.35(a)(4)(A)(ii) and Rule 7.35B(d), (d)(1), (d)(2), (e)(2), and 
(f)(1)(A) and (B).
    The Exchange would also delete current subsections (A), (B), and 
(C) of Rule 7.35B(d)(1) governing publication of a Regulatory Closing 
Imbalance and replace them with new subsections (A), (B), and (C) 
setting forth the proposed

[[Page 19372]]

formula for what constitutes a ``Significant'' imbalance. Current Rule 
7.35B(d)(1)(B), providing that a Regulatory Closing Imbalance is a one-
time publication that should not be updated, would be retained in 
proposed Rule 7.35B(d)(1)(D). The information in current Rule 
7.35B(d)(1)(C), providing that a Regulatory Closing Imbalance will be 
disseminated at the Closing Auction Imbalance Freeze Time regardless of 
whether the security has not opened or is halted or paused at that 
time, would be retained in proposed Rule 7.35B(d)(1).
    The Exchange believes that publishing imbalance information where 
the imbalance is of a size that equals or exceeds a large percentage of 
a security's average closing size over the most recent 20 trading days 
and is of a high notional value imparts more valuable information to 
the marketplace about potential trading anomalies or opportunities than 
an imbalance publication based solely on an imbalance size of 500 round 
lots or more. As a result, the Exchange believes that publication of 
Significant Closing Imbalance information as proposed could facilitate 
entry of offsetting orders and the price discovery process on the 
Exchange, to the benefit of the marketplace and public investors. In 
addition, the Exchange believes that it would be appropriate to retain 
flexibility to determine the percentage amounts and notional value in 
the formula for what constitutes a Significant Closing Imbalance so 
that the Exchange may timely take into consideration market movements 
and the changing trading characteristics of different securities.\18\
---------------------------------------------------------------------------

    \18\ The options markets operated by the Exchange's affiliates 
have similar flexibility in their rules to specify different 
parameters based on a Trader Update. See, e.g., NYSE Arca, Inc., 
Rules 6.62P-O(a)(3)(C) (specifying the thresholds applicable to 
limit order price protection) & 6.64P-O(c) (specifying interval when 
Auction Imbalance Information is updated).
---------------------------------------------------------------------------

Imbalance Reference Price
    Currently, the Closing Auction Imbalance Information includes the 
Continuous Book Clearing Price, which is the price at which all better-
priced orders eligible to trade in the Closing Auction on the Side of 
the Imbalance can be traded.\19\ The Closing Auction Imbalance 
Information also includes an Imbalance Reference Price, which is the 
Exchange Last Sale Price bound by the Exchange BBO.\20\ The Imbalance 
Reference Price for a Closing Imbalance is currently the Exchange Last 
Sale Price.\21\
---------------------------------------------------------------------------

    \19\ See Rule 7.35(a)(4)(C). In the case of a buy Imbalance, the 
Continuous Book Clearing Price would be the highest potential 
Closing Auction Price and in the case of a sell Imbalance, the 
Continuous Book Clearing Price would be the lowest potential Closing 
Auction Price.
    \20\ See Rule 7.35B(e)(3).
    \21\ See Rule 7.35B(d). See Rule 7.35(a)(12)(B)(defining 
``Exchange Last Sale Price'' to mean the most recent trade on the 
Exchange of a round lot or more in a security during Core Trading 
Hours on that trading day, and if none, the Official Closing Price 
from the prior trading day for that security).
---------------------------------------------------------------------------

    In order to provide the most accurate imbalance information, the 
Exchange proposes to align the definition of Imbalance Reference Price 
for a Closing Imbalance in Rule 7.35B(d) with the current definition of 
Imbalance Reference Price for the Closing Auction Imbalance Information 
in Rule 7.35B(e)(3). As proposed, the Imbalance Reference Price for a 
Closing Imbalance would be equal to
    <bullet> the BB if the Exchange Last Sale Price is lower than the 
BB;
    <bullet> the BO if the Exchange Last Sale Price is higher than the 
BO; or
    <bullet> the Exchange Last Sale Price if it is at or between the 
BBO or if the security was halted or not opened by the Closing Auction 
Imbalance Freeze Time.\22\
---------------------------------------------------------------------------

    \22\ See proposed Rule 7.35B(d).
---------------------------------------------------------------------------

    The Exchange believes that the proposal will enhance the value of 
the imbalance publication by providing a more accurate depiction of the 
market interest available in a security because bounding the Imbalance 
Reference Price by the BBO keeps the price in line with actual trading 
in that security.
Closing D Orders
    Finally, the Exchange proposes to include Closing D Orders earlier 
in the imbalance information provided to the marketplace.
    As noted above, the Exchange disseminates two types of Imbalance 
publications: Total Imbalance and Closing Imbalance. Total Imbalance 
information is disseminated for all Auctions, and Closing Imbalance 
information is disseminated for the Closing Auction only.
    Rule 7.35(a)(4)(A)(i) provides that ``Total Imbalance'' means for 
the Core Open and Trading Halt Auctions, the Imbalance of all orders 
eligible to participate in an Auction and for the Closing Auction, the 
Imbalance of MOC, LOC, and Closing IO Orders, and beginning five 
minutes before the scheduled end of Core Trading Hours, Closing D 
Orders.
    In addition, for the Closing Auction, the Exchange provides 
information on the ``Paired Quantity,'' which is the volume of better-
priced and at-priced buy shares that can be paired with better-priced 
and at-priced sell shares at the Imbalance Reference Price, and 
``Unpaired Quantity,'' meaning the volume of better-priced and at-
priced buy shares that cannot be paired with both at-priced and better-
priced sell shares at the Imbalance Reference Price. Paired and 
Unpaired Quantity as defined in Rule 7.35(a)(4)(B)(ii) to include MOC, 
LOC, and Closing IO Orders, and beginning five minutes before the 
scheduled end of Core Trading Hours, Closing D Orders.
    Further, Rule 7.35(b) sets forth general rules for how different 
types of orders are ranked for purposes of how they are included in 
Auction Imbalance Information or for an Auction allocation. Rule 
7.35(b)(1) provides that orders are ranked based on the price at which 
they would participate in an Auction. The price at which an order would 
be ranked would be used to determine whether it is a better-priced or 
an at-priced order. In this regard, beginning five minutes before the 
end of Core Trading Hours, the ranked price of a Closing D Order is the 
order's undisplayed discretionary price. In addition, under Rule 
7.35(b)(2), the working time of a Closing D Order would be the later of 
its entry time or five minutes before the end of Core Trading Hours.
    The Exchange proposes to amend these rules to reflect the inclusion 
of Closing D Orders beginning ten minutes before the scheduled end of 
Core Trading Hours. The Exchange believes that earlier inclusion of 
this order type in the imbalance information published by the Exchange 
would enhance the information available to the marketplace leading into 
the Closing Auction. Closing D Orders--Limit Orders with an instruction 
to exercise discretion in the Closing Auction up (down) to a designated 
undisplayed price \23\--are an extremely versatile order type, and the 
Exchange has observed that an increasing proportion of the Closing 
Auction is comprised of Closing D Orders.\24\ The Exchange believes 
that including Closing D Orders in its publicly disseminated imbalance 
information earlier would provide more information to the marketplace 
about the volume and type of orders going into the Closing Auction as 
well as

[[Page 19373]]

additional time for the market to respond to any auction imbalances.
---------------------------------------------------------------------------

    \23\ See Rule 7.31(c)(2)(C).
    \24\ For instance, in the third quarter of 2021, D Orders 
constituted 36.6% of volume in the Closing Auction. As of the third 
quarter of 2023, D Orders comprised 42.7% of Closing Auction volume, 
more than any other order type. See <a href="https://www.nyse.com/data-insights/nyse-closing-auction-dynamics-2023">https://www.nyse.com/data-insights/nyse-closing-auction-dynamics-2023</a>.
---------------------------------------------------------------------------

    Because of the technology changes associated with the proposed 
changes, the Exchange proposes that, subject to approval of the 
proposed rule change, the Exchange will announce the implementation 
date of the proposed rule changes by Trader Update. Subject to approval 
of this proposed rule change, the Exchange anticipates that such 
changes will be implemented before the end of the fourth quarter of 
2024.
2. Statutory Basis
    The Exchange believes that the proposed rule change is consistent 
with Section 6(b) of the Act,\25\ in general, and furthers the 
objectives of Section 6(b)(5) of the Act,\26\ in that it is designed to 
prevent fraudulent and manipulative acts and practices, to promote just 
and equitable principles of trade, to foster cooperation and 
coordination with persons engaged in facilitating transactions in 
securities, to remove impediments to and perfect the mechanisms of a 
free and open market and a national market system and, in general, to 
protect investors and the public interest and because it is not 
designed to permit unfair discrimination between customers, issuers, 
brokers, or dealers.
---------------------------------------------------------------------------

    \25\ 15 U.S.C. 78f(b).
    \26\ 15 U.S.C. 78f(b)(5).
---------------------------------------------------------------------------

    The proposed changes to Rule 7.35 and Rule 7.35B relating to 
publication of a Significant Closing Imbalance and inclusion of Closing 
D Orders in the Exchange's published imbalance five minutes earlier 
would enhance the imbalance information that the Exchange publishes and 
the total ``mix'' of information available to the marketplace leading 
into the Closing Auction, thereby promoting transparency and removing 
impediments to and perfecting the mechanisms of a free and open market 
and a national market system.
    As noted above, the Exchange would retire a Regulatory Closing 
Imbalance based on a static round-lot trigger in favor of a Significant 
Closing Imbalance based on a dynamic formula that would take into 
account the notional size of the imbalance and the recent closing 
activity of the impacted security. The Exchange believes that 
triggering an imbalance publication based on whether the Closing 
Imbalance equals or exceeds a percentage of the recent 20-day average 
closing size and a high notional value would provide investors with a 
more meaningful depiction of the market interest in a security that 
would assist them in trading the imbalance and the Closing Auction in 
that security. Further, including Closing D Orders in the Total 
Imbalance calculation ten minutes before the scheduled end of Core 
Trading Hours would similarly enhance the information available to 
investors going into the Closing Auction and could also attract 
additional contra-side interest, thereby decreasing volatility and 
ultimately contributing to the maintenance of a fair and orderly market 
consistent with the protection of investors and the public interest 
under Section 6(b)(5) of the Act.\27\
---------------------------------------------------------------------------

    \27\ 15 U.S.C. 78f(b)(5).
---------------------------------------------------------------------------

    Allowing the Exchange the flexibility to determine the percentage 
amounts and notional value in the formula for what constitutes a 
Significant Closing Imbalance permits the Exchange to take market 
movements and the characteristics of different securities into 
consideration in real-time and update the metrics as needed. The 
proposal is also consistent with discretion to announce different 
parameters as circumstances warrant by Trader Update that is available 
on other exchanges.\28\
---------------------------------------------------------------------------

    \28\ See note 18, supra.
---------------------------------------------------------------------------

    Finally, the Exchange believes that determining the Imbalance 
Reference Price for a Closing Auction in the same way the Exchange 
currently determines the Imbalance Reference Price for the Closing 
Auction Imbalance Information would provide a more updated depiction of 
the market interest available in a security when the Imbalance 
Reference Price is published because bounding the Imbalance Reference 
Price by the BBO keeps the price in line with actual trading in that 
security. The proposal would also promote consistency in the Exchange's 
rulebook, thereby removing impediments to and perfecting the mechanism 
of a free and open market and a national market system.

B. Self-Regulatory Organization's Statement on Burden on Competition

    The Exchange does not believe that the proposed rule change will 
impose any burden on competition that is not necessary or appropriate 
in furtherance of the purposes of the Act. The proposed rule change is 
not intended to address competitive issues but rather is concerned 
solely with enhancing the quality of the imbalance information the 
Exchange publishes going into the Closing Auction, thereby promoting 
transparency in the Closing Auction process and the Exchange's 
marketplace.

C. Self-Regulatory Organization's Statement on Comments on the Proposed 
Rule Change Received From Members, Participants, or Others

    No written comments were solicited or received with respect to the 
proposed rule change.

III. Date of Effectiveness of the Proposed Rule Change and Timing for 
Commission Action

which the self-regulatory organization consents, the Commission will:
    (A) by order approve or disapprove the proposed rule change, or
    (B) institute proceedings to determine whether the proposed rule 
change should be disapproved.
