SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION: Pursuant to the provisions of the Privacy 
Act of 1974, the NCUA is rescinding the following two systems of 
records notices from its system of records inventory. As part of a 
routine review, the NCUA determined that these systems of records 
notices have been superseded by government-wide system of records 
notices. A government-wide system of records is a system of records in 
which one agency has regulatory authority over the records in the 
custody of multiple agencies and that agency has the responsibility for 
publishing a system of records notice that applies to all records 
regardless of their custodial location. The original publication of 
these system of records notices is covered below in the History 
section.

Compensation Act File (published at 81 FR 25776 on April 29, 2016).
    2. NCUA-14, PaymentNet J.P. Morgan Chase Bank PaymentNet. This
