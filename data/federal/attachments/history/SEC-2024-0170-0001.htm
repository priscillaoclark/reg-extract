    Pursuant to the provisions of Section 19(b)(1) of the Securities

is hereby given that on January 24, 2024, MIAX Emerald, LLC (``MIAX 
Emerald'' or ``Exchange'') filed with the Securities and Exchange

Items I and II below, which Items have been prepared by the Exchange. 
The Commission is publishing this notice to solicit comments on the 
proposed rule change from interested persons.
---------------------------------------------------------------------------

    \1\ 15 U.S.C. 78s(b)(1).
    \2\ 17 CFR 240.19b-4.
---------------------------------------------------------------------------

I. Self-Regulatory Organization's Statement of the Terms of Substance 
of the Proposed Rule Change

    The Exchange is filing a proposal to update citations to Rule 
600(b) of Regulation National Market System (``Regulation NMS'') in 
Exchange Rule 518, Complex Orders and Rule 530, Limit Up-Limit Down.
    The text of the proposed rule change is available on the Exchange's 
website at <a href="https://www.miaxglobal.com/markets/us-options/emerald-options/rule-filings">https://www.miaxglobal.com/markets/us-options/emerald-options/rule-filings</a>, at MIAX Emerald's principal office, and at the 
Commission's Public Reference Room.

II. Self-Regulatory Organization's Statement of the Purpose of, and 
Statutory Basis for, the Proposed Rule Change

    In its filing with the Commission, the Exchange included statements 
concerning the purpose of and basis for the proposed rule change and 
discussed any comments it received on the proposed rule change. The 
text of these statements may be examined at the places specified in 
Item IV below. The Exchange has prepared summaries, set forth in 
sections A, B, and C below, of the most significant aspects of such 
statements.

A. Self-Regulatory Organization's Statement of the Purpose of, and 
Statutory Basis for, the Proposed Rule Change

1. Purpose
    The Exchange proposes to update citations to Rule 600(b) of 
Regulation NMS in Exchange Rule 518, Complex Orders and Rule 530, Limit 
Up-Limit Down.
    In 2021, the Securities and Exchange Commission (the 
``Commission'') amended Regulation NMS under the Act in connection with 
the adoption of the Market Data Infrastructure Rules.\3\ As part of 
that initiative, the Commission adopted new definitions in Rule 600(b) 
of Regulation NMS and renumbered the remaining definitions, including 
the definitions of Trading Center (formerly Rule 600(b)(78)), NMS Stock 
(formerly Rule 600(b)(47)), and Regular Trading Hours (formerly Rule 
600(b)(64)).
---------------------------------------------------------------------------

    \3\ See Securities Exchange Act Release No. 90610, 86 FR 18596 
(April 9, 2021) (S7-03-20).
---------------------------------------------------------------------------

    The Exchange accordingly proposes to update the relevant citations 
to Rule 600(b) in its rules as follows:
    <bullet> The citation to the definition of NMS Stock in Rule 518 
would be changed to Rule 600(b)(55).
    <bullet> The citation to the definition of Trading Center in Rule 
518 would be changed to Rule 600(b)(95).
    <bullet> The citation to the definition of Regular Trading Hours in 
Rule 530, Limit Up-Limit Down, would be changed to Rule 600(b)(77).
2. Statutory Basis
    The Exchange believes the proposed rules changes are consistent 
with the Act and the rules and regulations thereunder applicable to the 
Exchange and, in particular, the requirements of Section 6(b) of the 
Act.\4\ Specifically, the Exchange believes the proposed rules changes 
are consistent with Section 6(b)(5) \5\ requirements that the rules of 
an exchange be designed to prevent fraudulent and manipulative acts and 
practices, to promote just and equitable principles of trade, to foster 
cooperation and coordination with persons engaged in regulating, 
clearing, settling, processing information with respect to, and 
facilitating transactions in securities, to remove impediments to and 
perfect the mechanism of a free and open market and a national market 
system, and, in general, to protect investors and the public interest.
---------------------------------------------------------------------------

    \4\ 15 U.S.C. 78f(b).
    \5\ 15 U.S.C. 78f(b)(5).
---------------------------------------------------------------------------

    The Exchange believes that the proposed changes to its rules to 
correct citations to Rule 600(b) of Regulation NMS would remove 
impediments to and perfect the mechanism of a free and open market and 
a national market system because the proposed change is designed to 
update an external rule reference. The Exchange believes that Members 
\6\ would benefit from the increased clarity, thereby reducing 
potential confusion and ensuring that those subject to the Exchange's 
jurisdiction, regulators, and the investing public can more easily 
navigate and understand the Exchange's rules. The Exchange further 
believes that the proposed changes would not be inconsistent with the 
public interest and the protection of investors because investors will 
not be harmed and in fact would benefit from increased clarity, thereby 
reducing potential confusion.
---------------------------------------------------------------------------

    \6\ The term ``Member'' means an individual or organization 
approved to exercise the trading rights associated with a Trading 
Permit. Members are deemed ``members'' under the Exchange Act. See 
Exchange Rule 100.
---------------------------------------------------------------------------

B. Self-Regulatory Organization's Statement on Burden on Competition

    The Exchange believes that the proposed rules changes would not 
impose any burden on competition that is not necessary or appropriate 
in furtherance of the purposes of the Act. The proposed rules changes 
is not intended to address competitive issues but rather would modify 
Exchange rules to update citations to Rule 600(b) of Regulation NMS. 
Since the proposal

[[Page 9279]]

does not substantively modify System \7\ functionality or processes on 
the Exchange, the proposed changes will not impose any burden on 
competition nor are they meant to affect competition among the 
exchanges.
---------------------------------------------------------------------------

    \7\ The term ``System'' means the automated trading system used 
by the Exchange for the trading of securities. See Exchange Rule 
100.
---------------------------------------------------------------------------

C. Self-Regulatory Organization's Statement on Comments on the Proposed 
Rule Change Received From Members, Participants, or Others

    Written comments were neither solicited nor received.

III. Date of Effectiveness of the Proposed Rule Change and Timing for 
Commission Action

    Because the foregoing proposed rule change does not: (i) 
significantly affect the protection of investors or the public 
interest; (ii) impose any significant burden on competition; and (iii) 
become operative for 30 days from the date on which it was filed, or 
such shorter time as the Commission may designate, it has become 
effective pursuant to Section 19(b)(3)(A) of the Act \8\ and 
subparagraph (f)(6) of Rule 19b-4 thereunder.\9\
---------------------------------------------------------------------------

    \8\ 15 U.S.C. 78s(b)(3)(A).
    \9\ 17 CFR 240.19b-4(f)(6). In addition, Rule 19b-4(f)(6) 
requires a self-regulatory organization to give the Commission 
written notice of its intent to file the proposed rule change, along 
with a brief description and text of the proposed rule change, at 
least five business days prior to the date of filing of the proposed 
rule change, or such shorter time as designated by the Commission. 
The Exchange has satisfied this requirement.
---------------------------------------------------------------------------

    A proposed rule change filed pursuant to Rule 19b-4(f)(6) under the 
Act normally does not become operative for 30 days after the date of 
its filing. However, Rule 19b-4(f)(6)(iii) \10\ permits the Commission 
to designate a shorter time if such action is consistent with the 
protection of investors and the public interest. The Exchange has 
requested that the Commission waive the 30-day operative delay so that 
the proposal may become operative immediately upon filing. The proposed 
change modifies the Exchange's rules to correct citations to Rule 
600(b) of Regulation NMS, which should help prevent confusion and add 
clarity to the Exchange's rules. For these reasons, and because the 
proposal raises no novel legal or regulatory issues, the Commission 
believes that waiver of the 30-day operative delay is consistent with 
the protection of investors and the public interest. Accordingly, the 
Commission hereby waives the 30-day operative delay and designates the 
proposed rule change operative upon filing.\11\
---------------------------------------------------------------------------

    \10\ 17 CFR 240.19b-4(f)(6)(iii).
    \11\ For purposes only of waiving the 30-day operative delay, 
the Commission has also considered the proposed rule's impact on 
efficiency, competition, and capital formation. See 15 U.S.C. 
78c(f).
---------------------------------------------------------------------------

    At any time within 60 days of the filing of the proposed rule 
change, the Commission summarily may temporarily suspend such rule 
change if it appears to the Commission that such action is necessary or 
appropriate in the public interest, for the protection of investors, or 
otherwise in furtherance of the purposes of the Act. If the Commission 
takes such action, the Commission shall institute proceedings to 
determine whether the proposed rule change should be approved or 
disapproved.
