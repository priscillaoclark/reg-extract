SECURITIES AND EXCHANGE COMMISSION

[SEC File No. 270-663, OMB Control No. 3235-0724]


Proposed Collection; Comment Request; Extension: Supplier 
Diversity Business Management System

Upon Written Request, Copies Available From: Securities and Exchange 
Commission, Office of FOIA Services, 100 F Street NE, Washington, DC 
20549-2736

    Notice is hereby given that, pursuant to the Paperwork Reduction 
Act of 1995 (44 U.S.C. 3501 et seq.), the Securities and Exchange 
Commission (``Commission'') is soliciting comments on the existing 
collection of information summarized below. The Commission plans to 
submit this existing collection of information to the Office of 
Management and Budget (``OMB'') for approval.
    The Commission is required under Section 342 of the Dodd Frank Wall 
Street and Reform Act to develop standards and processes for ensuring 
the fair inclusion of minority-owned and women-owned businesses in all 
of the Commission's business activities. To help implement this 
requirement, the Office of Minority and Women Inclusion (OMWI) 
developed and maintains an electronic Supplier Diversity Business 
Management System (SDBMS) to collect up-to-date business information 
and capabilities statements from diverse suppliers interested in doing 
business with the Commission. This information allows the Commission to 
update and more effectively manage its current internal repository. It 
also allows the Commission to measure the effectiveness of its 
technical assistance and outreach efforts, and target areas where 
additional program efforts are necessary.
    The Commission invites comment on SDBMS. Information is collected 
in SDBMS via web-based, e-filed, dynamic form-based technology. The 
company point of contact completes a profile consisting of basic 
contact data and information on the capabilities of the business. The 
profile includes a series of questions, some of which are based on the 
data that the individual enters. Drop-down lists are included where 
appropriate to increase ease of use.
    Title of Collection: Supplier Diversity Business Management System.
    Type of Review: Request for Extension.
    Estimated Number of Respondents Annually: 300.
    Estimated Burden Hours per Respondent: 30 minutes.
    Estimated Total Annual Burden Hours: 150 hours.
    Request for Comments: The comments submitted in response to this 
notice will be summarized and included in the request for OMB approval. 
All comments will become a matter of public record. Written comments 
are invited on: (a) whether this collection of information is necessary 
for the proper performance of the functions of the agency, including 
whether the information will have practical utility; (b) the accuracy 
of the agency's estimate of the burden imposed by the collection of 
information; (c) ways to enhance the quality, utility, and clarity of 
the information collected; and (d) ways to minimize the burden of the 
collection of information on respondents, including through the use of 
automated collection techniques or other forms of information 
technology. Consideration will be given to comments and suggestions 
submitted by April 1, 2024.
    An agency may not conduct or sponsor, and a person is not required 
to respond to, a collection of information under the PRA unless it 
displays a currently valid OMB control number.
    Please direct your written comments to David Bottom, Director/Chief 
Information Officer, Securities and Exchange Commission, c/o John 
Pezzullo, 100 F Street NE, Washington, DC 20549 or send an email to:
