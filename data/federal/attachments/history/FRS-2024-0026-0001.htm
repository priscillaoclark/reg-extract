Final Approval Under OMB Delegated Authority of the Extension for Three

    Collection title: Recordkeeping and Disclosure Requirements 
Associated with Regulation H (Securities Transactions by State Member 
Banks).
    Collection identifier: FR H-3.
    OMB control number: 7100-0196.
    General description of collection: Section 15C of the Securities 
Exchange Act of 1934, establishes federal regulation of brokers and 
dealers of government securities, including banks and other financial 
institutions, and directs those brokers and dealers to keep certain 
records.\1\ These requirements are implemented for state member banks 
(SMBs) by sections 208.34(c), (d), and (g) of the Board's Regulation H, 
which require that non-exempt SMBs \2\ effecting securities 
transactions for customers establish and maintain a system of records 
of these transactions, furnish confirmations of transactions to 
customers that disclose certain information, and establish written 
policies and procedures relating to securities trading.
---------------------------------------------------------------------------

    \1\ 15 U.S.C. 78o-5.
    \2\ The requirements of section 208.34 of Regulation H apply to 
all state member banks that effect more than 500 government 
securities brokerage transactions per year, unless the institution 
has filed a written notice, or is required to file notice, with the 
Board that it acts as a government securities broker or a government 
securities dealer. These requirements also do not apply to 
activities of foreign branches of SMBs; activities of nonmember, 
non-insured trust company subsidiaries of bank holding companies; or 
activities that are subject to regulations promulgated by the 
Municipal Securities Rulemaking Board. In addition, SMBs with an 
annual average of less than 200 securities transactions for 
customers over the prior three calendar years (exclusive of 
transactions in U.S. government and agency obligations) are exempt 
from these Regulation H recordkeeping and disclosure requirements. 
See 12 CFR 208.34(a)(1)(i)-(iv).
---------------------------------------------------------------------------

    Frequency: Event-generated, quarterly.
    Respondents: SMBs, SMB officers/employees.
    Total estimated number of respondents: 3,368.
    Total estimated annual burden hours: 100,774.\3\

including more detailed burden estimates, can be found in the OMB 
Supporting Statement posted at <a href="https://www.federalreserve.gov/apps/reportingforms/home/review">https://www.federalreserve.gov/apps/reportingforms/home/review</a>. On the page displayed at the link, you
