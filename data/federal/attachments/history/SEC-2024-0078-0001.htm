    Pursuant to section 19(b)(1) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 
(the ``Act''),\1\ and Rule 19b-4 thereunder,\2\ notice is hereby given 
that on January 2, 2024, Cboe EDGX Exchange, Inc. (the ``Exchange'' or 
``EDGX'') filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission (the 
``Commission'') the proposed rule change as described in Items I and

I. Self-Regulatory Organization's Statement of the Terms of Substance 
of the Proposed Rule Change

    Cboe EDGX Exchange, Inc. (the ``Exchange'' or ``EDGX Options'') 
proposes to amend its Fee Schedule. The text of the proposed rule 
change is provided in Exhibit 5.
    The text of the proposed rule change is also available on the 
Exchange's website (<a href="http://markets.cboe.com/us/options/regulation/rule_filings/edgx/">http://markets.cboe.com/us/options/regulation/rule_filings/edgx/</a>), at the Exchange's Office of the Secretary, and at 
the Commission's Public Reference Room.

II. Self-Regulatory Organization's Statement of the Purpose of, and 
Statutory Basis for, the Proposed Rule Change

    In its filing with the Commission, the Exchange included statements 
concerning the purpose of and basis for the proposed rule change and 
discussed any comments it received on the proposed rule change. The 
text of these statements may be examined at the places specified in 
Item IV below. The Exchange has prepared summaries, set forth in 
sections A, B, and C below, of the most significant aspects of such 
statements.

A. Self-Regulatory Organization's Statement of the Purpose of, and 
Statutory Basis for, the Proposed Rule Change

1. Purpose
    The Exchange proposes to amend its fee schedule for its equity 
options platform (``EDGX Options'') relating to logical connectivity 
fees.
    By way of background, the Exchange offers a variety of logical 
ports, which provide users with the ability within the Exchange's 
System to accomplish a specific function through a connection, such as 
order entry, data receipt or access to information. The Exchange 
currently assesses, among other things, the following logical port 
connectivity fees on a monthly basis: $500 per port for Logical Ports; 
\3\ $500 per port for Multicast PITCH Spin Server Ports (``Spin 
Ports'') and GRP Ports; \4\ and $600 per port for Ports with Bulk 
Quoting Capabilities \5\ (``Bulk Ports''). The Exchange proposes to 
increase the monthly fees for the forgoing ports to the following 
rates: $750 per port for Logical Ports, Spin Ports and GRP Ports and 
$1,000 per port for Bulk Ports. The Exchange notes the proposed fee 
change better enables it to continue to maintain and improve its market 
technology and services and also notes that the proposed fee amount, 
even as amended, continues to be in line with, or even lower than, 
amounts assessed by other exchanges for similar connections, including 
the Exchange's affiliated options exchanges.\6\
---------------------------------------------------------------------------

    \3\ Logical Ports include FIX and BOE ports (used for order 
entry), drop logical port (which grants users the ability to receive 
and/or send drop copies) and ports that are used for receipt of 
certain market data feeds.
    \4\ Spin Ports and GRP Ports are used to request and receive a 
retransmission of data from the Exchange's Multicast PITCH data 
feeds.
    \5\ Bulk Quoting Capabilities Ports provide users with the 
ability to submit and update multiple bids and offers in one message 
through logical ports enabled for bulk-quoting.
    \6\ See, e.g., Cboe C2 Options Exchange Fee Schedule, Options 
Logical Port Fees, Cboe BZX Options Exchange Fee Schedule, Options 
Logical Port Fees and Cboe Exchange Fees Schedule, Logical 
Connectivity Fees; see also The Nasdaq Stock Market Options Pricing 
Schedule, Section 3 Nasdaq Options Market--Ports and Other Services.

---------------------------------------------------------------------------

2. Statutory Basis
    The Exchange believes the proposed rule change is consistent with 
the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 (the ``Act'') and the rules and 
regulations thereunder applicable to the Exchange and, in particular, 
the requirements of section 6(b) of the Act.\7\ Specifically, the 
Exchange believes the proposed rule change is consistent with the 
section 6(b)(5) \8\ requirements that the rules of an exchange be 
designed to prevent fraudulent and manipulative acts and practices, to 
promote just and equitable principles of trade, to foster cooperation 
and coordination with persons engaged in regulating, clearing, 
settling, processing information with respect to, and facilitating 
transactions in securities, to remove impediments to and perfect the 
mechanism of a free and open market and a national market system, and, 
in general, to protect investors and the public interest. Additionally, 
the Exchange believes the proposed rule change is consistent with the 
section 6(b)(5) \9\ requirement that the rules of an exchange not be 
designed to permit unfair discrimination between customers, issuers, 
brokers, or dealers. The Exchange also believes the proposed rule 
change is consistent with section 6(b)(4) \10\ of the Act, which 
requires that Exchange rules provide for the equitable allocation of 
reasonable dues, fees, and other charges among its Members and other 
persons using its facilities.

    \9\ Id.
    \10\ 15 U.S.C. 78f(b)(4).
---------------------------------------------------------------------------

    The Exchange believes the proposed fee is reasonable as it is still 
in line with, or even lower than, amounts assessed by other exchanges 
for similar connections.\11\ Indeed, the Exchange believes assessing 
fees that are a lower rate than fees assessed by other exchanges for 
analogous connectivity (which were similarly adopted via the rule 
filing process and filed with the Commission) is reasonable. 
Additionally, the Exchange believes the proposed fee increase is 
reasonable in light of anticipated upgrades to the Exchange's matching 
engines, which is expected to be completed in the first quarter of 
2024.
---------------------------------------------------------------------------

    \11\ See, e.g., Cboe C2 Options Exchange Fee Schedule, Options 
Logical Port Fees, Cboe BZX Options Exchange Fee Schedule, Options 
Logical Port Fees and Cboe Exchange Fees Schedule, Logical 
Connectivity Fees see also The Nasdaq Stock Market Options Pricing 
Schedule, Section 3 Nasdaq Options Market--Ports and Other Services.
---------------------------------------------------------------------------

    The Exchange also notes market participants may continue to choose 
the method of connectivity based on their specific needs, and no 
broker-dealer is required to become a Member of, let alone connect 
directly to, the Exchange. There is also no regulatory requirement that 
any market participant connect to any one particular exchange. 
Moreover, direct connectivity is not a requirement to participate on 
the Exchange. The Exchange also believes substitutable products and 
services are available to market participants, including, among other 
things, other options exchanges to which a market participant may 
connect in lieu of the Exchange, indirect connectivity to the Exchange 
via a third-party reseller of connectivity, and/or trading of any 
options product, such as within the Over-the-Counter (OTC) markets, 
which do not require connectivity to the Exchange. Indeed, there are 
currently 17 registered options exchanges that trade options (13 of 
which are not affiliated with Cboe), some of which have similar or 
lower connectivity fees.\12\ Based on publicly available information, 
no single options exchange has more than approximately 17% of the 
market share.\13\ Further, low barriers to entry mean that new 
exchanges may rapidly enter the market and offer additional substitute 
platforms to further compete with the Exchange and the products it 
offers. For example, there are 4 exchanges that have been added in the 
U.S. options markets in the last 5 years (i.e., Nasdaq MRX, LLC, MIAX 
Pearl, LLC, MIAX Emerald LLC, and most recently MEMX LLC), with a fifth 
options exchange anticipated to added in 2024 (MIAX Sapphire, LLC).

(December 20, 2023), available at <a href="https://markets.cboe.com/us/options/market_statistics/">https://markets.cboe.com/us/options/market_statistics/</a>.
---------------------------------------------------------------------------

    As for market participants that determine to continue to maintain 
membership or to join the Exchange for business purposes, those 
business reasons presumably result in revenue capable of covering the 
proposed fee. Further, for such market participants that choose to 
connect to the Exchange, the Exchange believes the proposed fees 
continue to provide flexibility with respect to how to connect to the 
Exchange based on each market participants' respective business needs. 
For example, the amount and type of logical ports are determined by 
factors relevant and specific to each market participant, including its 
business model, costs of connectivity, how its business is segmented 
and allocated and volume of messages sent to the Exchange. Moreover, 
the Exchange notes that it does not have unlimited system capacity and 
the proposed fees are also designed to encourage market participants to 
be efficient with their respective logical port usage. There is also no 
requirement that any market participant maintain a specific number of 
logical ports and a market participant may choose to maintain as many 
or as few of such ports as each deems appropriate.
    As noted above, there is no regulatory requirement that any market 
participant connect to any one options exchange, nor that any market 
participant connect at a particular connection speed or act in a 
particular capacity on the Exchange, or trade any particular product 
offered on an exchange. Moreover, membership is not a requirement to 
participate on the Exchange. Indeed, the Exchange is unaware of any one 
options exchange whose membership includes every registered broker-
dealer. By way of example, while the Exchange has 51 members that trade 
options, Cboe BZX has 61 members that trade options, and Cboe C2 has 52 
Trading Permit Holders (``TPHs'') (i.e., members). There is also no 
firm that is a Member of EDGX Options only. Further, based on 
previously publicly available information regarding a sample of the 
Exchange's competitors, NYSE American Options has 71 members,\14\ and 
NYSE Arca Options has 69 members,\15\ MIAX Options has 46 members \16\ 
and MIAX Pearl Options has 40 members.\17\ Accordingly, excessive fees 
would simply serve to reduce demand for these products, which market 
participants are under no regulatory obligation to utilize.

---------------------------------------------------------------------------

    The Exchange also believes that the proposed fee change is not 
unfairly discriminatory because it would be assessed uniformly across 
all market participants that purchase the respective logical ports. All 
Members have the option to select any connectivity option, and there is 
no differentiation among Members with regard to the fees charged for 
the services offered by the Exchange.

B. Self-Regulatory Organization's Statement on Burden on Competition

    The Exchange does not believe that the proposed rule change will 
impose any burden on competition that is not necessary or appropriate 
in furtherance

[[Page 3959]]

of the purposes of the Act. The Exchange believes the proposed fee 
change will not impact intramarket competition because it will apply to 
all similarly situated market participants equally (i.e., all market 
participants that choose to purchase the relevant logical ports).
    The Exchange believes the proposed fees will not impact intermarket 
competition because they are also in line with, or even lower than some 
fees for similar connectivity on other exchanges, and therefore may 
stimulate intermarket competition by attracting additional firms to 
connect to the Exchange or at least should not deter interested 
participants from connecting directly to the Exchange. Further, if the 
changes proposed herein are unattractive to market participants, the 
Exchange can, and likely will, see a decline in usage of these ports as 
a result. The Exchange operates in a highly competitive market in which 
market participants can determine whether or not to connect directly to 
the Exchange based on the value received compared to the cost of doing 
so. Indeed, market participants have numerous alternative venues that 
they may participate on and direct their order flow, including 13 (soon 
to be 14) non-Cboe affiliated options markets, as well as off-exchange 
venues, where competitive products are available for trading. Moreover, 
the Commission has repeatedly expressed its preference for competition 
over regulatory intervention in determining prices, products, and 
services in the securities markets. Specifically, in Regulation NMS, 
the Commission highlighted the importance of market forces in 
determining prices and SRO revenues and, also, recognized that current 
regulation of the market system ``has been remarkably successful in 
promoting market competition in its broader forms that are most 
important to investors and listed companies.'' \18\ The fact that this 
market is competitive has also long been recognized by the courts. In 
NetCoalition v. Securities and Exchange Commission, the D.C. Circuit 
stated as follows: ``[n]o one disputes that competition for order flow 
is `fierce.' . . . As the SEC explained, `[i]n the U.S. national market 
system, buyers and sellers of securities, and the broker-dealers that 
act as their order-routing agents, have a wide range of choices of 
where to route orders for execution'; [and] `no exchange can afford to 
take its market share percentages for granted' because `no exchange 
possesses a monopoly, regulatory or otherwise, in the execution of 
order flow from broker dealers'. . . .''.\19\ Accordingly, the Exchange 
does not believe its proposed change imposes any burden on competition 
that is not necessary or appropriate in furtherance of the purposes of 
the Act.
