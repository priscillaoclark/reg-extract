SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION: 
    Title: Gross Collection of Exchange-Set Margins for Omnibus 
Accounts (OMB Control No. 3038-0026). This is a request for extension 
of a currently approved information collection.
    Abstract: Commission Regulation 1.58 requires futures commission 
merchants to collect exchange-set margin for omnibus accounts on a 
gross, rather than a net, basis. The regulation provides that the 
carrying FCM need not collect margin for positions traded by a person 
through an omnibus account in excess of the amount that would be 
required if the same person, instead of trading through an omnibus 
account, maintained its own account with the carrying FCM. To prevent 
abuse of this exception to the regulation, a carrying FCM must maintain 
a written representation from the originating FCM or foreign broker 
that the particular positions held in the omnibus account are part of a 
hedge or spread transaction. This collection of information is 
necessary in order to provide documentation that can be inspected with 
regard to questions of proper compliance with gross margining 
requirements. This rule is promulgated pursuant to the Commission's 
rulemaking authority contained in Sections 4c, 4d, 4f, 4g and 8a of the 
Commodity Exchange Act, 7 U.S.C. 6c, 6d, 6f, 6g and 12a.
    An agency may not conduct or sponsor, and a person is not required 
to respond to, a collection of information unless it displays a 
currently valid OMB control number. The Federal Register notice with a 
60-day comment period soliciting comments on this collection of 
information was published on November 17, 2023 (88 FR 80284) (``60-Day 
Notice''). The Commission did not receive any relevant comments on the 
60-Day Notice.
    Burden Statement: The Commission is revising its estimate of the 
burden due to the reduced number of futures commission merchants in the 
industry. The respondent burden for this collection is estimated to be 
as follows:
    Respondents/Affected Entities: 52.
    Estimated Total Annual Responses: 208.
    Estimated Total Annual Burden Hours: 17 hours.
    Frequency of collection: On occasion.
    There are no capital costs or operating and maintenance costs 
associated with this collection.

(Authority: 44 U.S.C. 3501 et seq.)

    Dated: January 23, 2024.
Robert Sidman,
Deputy Secretary of the Commission.
