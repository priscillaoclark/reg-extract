SECURITIES AND EXCHANGE COMMISSION

[SEC File No. 270-668, OMB Control No. 3235-0751]


Proposed Collection; Comment Request; Extension: Rule 18a-6

Upon Written Request, Copies Available From: Securities and Exchange 
Commission, Office of FOIA Services, 100 F Street NE, Washington, DC 
20549-2736

    Notice is hereby given that pursuant to the Paperwork Reduction Act 
of 1995 (``PRA'') (44 U.S.C. 3501 et seq.), the Securities and Exchange 
Commission (``Commission'') is soliciting comments on the existing 
collection of information provided for in Rule 18a-6 (17 CFR 240.18a-
6), under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 (15 U.S.C. 78a et seq.). 
The Commission plans to submit this existing collection of information 
to the Office of Management and Budget (``OMB'') for extension and 
approval.
    Rule 18a-6, which is modeled on Rule 17a-4, establishes record 
maintenance and preservation requirements for stand-alone and bank 
security-based swap dealers (``SBSDs'') and major security-based swap 
participants (``MSBSPs'') (collectively, ``SBS entities''). 
Specifically, Rule 18a-6 prescribes the period of time the records 
required to be made and kept current under Rule 18a-5 must be preserved 
by stand-alone SBSDs and MSBSPs and the manner in which the records 
must be preserved. Rule 18a-6 also identifies additional types of 
records that must be preserved (e.g., written communications and 
agreements relating to the firm's business) if the record is made or 
received by the SBS entity.
    The Commission estimates that the total hour burden under Rule 18a-
6 is approximately 15,626 burden hours per year, and the total cost 
burden is approximately $1,349,098 per year.
    Written comments are invited on: (a) whether the proposed 
collection of information is necessary for the proper performance of 
the functions of the Commission, including whether the information 
shall have practical utility; (b) the accuracy of the Commission's 
estimates of the burden of the proposed collection of information; (c) 
ways to enhance the quality, utility, and clarity of the information 
collected; and (d) ways to minimize the burden of the collection of 
information on respondents, including through the use of automated 
collection techniques or other forms of information technology. 
Consideration will be given to comments and suggestions submitted by 
May 20, 2024.
    An agency may not conduct or sponsor, and a person is not required 
to respond to, a collection of information unless it displays a 
currently valid OMB control number.
    Please direct your written comments to: David Bottom, Director/
Chief Information Officer, Securities and Exchange Commission, c/o John 
Pezzullo, 100 F Street NE, Washington, DC 20549, or send an email to:

Sherry R. Haywood,
Assistant Secretary.
