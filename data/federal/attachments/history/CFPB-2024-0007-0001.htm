SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION: 
    Title of Collection: Consumer Complaint Survey.
    OMB Control Number: 3170-00XX.
    Type of Review: New information collection.
    Affected Public: Individuals or households.
    Estimated Number of Respondents: 13,200.
    Estimated Total Annual Burden Hours: 6,600.
    Abstract: The Dodd-Frank Wall Street Reform and Consumer Protection 
Act charges the CFPB with researching, analyzing, and reporting on 
topics relating to the CFPB's mission including consumer behavior, 
consumer awareness, and developments in markets for consumer financial 
products and services. To improve its understanding of consumers and 
institutional actors in financial markets, the CFPB makes use of data 
collected through the complaint process. The CFPB seeks to enhance the 
utility of these data by better understanding the broader population of 
consumers who experience issues with their financial products and 
services.
    The CFPB proposes to collect data with two new surveys intended to 
identify factors that influence a consumer's decision to use the 
complaint process. The initial pilot survey will focus on consumers who 
have experienced issues with their credit cards and will include a 
sample of people who have used the CFPB's complaint process, and 
another sample of people who experienced similar issues but did not 
file a complaint with the CFPB. This design (known as a case-control 
study) will allow us to identify key factors that are associated with 
submitting regulatory complaints.
    The pilot survey will inform a second survey which will focus on a 
broader range of products and services. The second survey will (to the 
extent feasible) cover additional products about which consumers can 
submit complaints to the CFPB including (but not limited to) mortgages, 
vehicle loans, bank accounts, and debts owed to third-party debt 
collectors. Both surveys will collect data about factors that may play 
a role in consumer's decision to submit a complaint. These include 
information about their use of a given product, the problems they 
encountered when using a given product, their attitudes and perceptions 
towards the product and its offeror, as well as demographic 
information.
    Request for Comments: Comments are invited on: (a) Whether the 
collection of information is necessary for the proper performance of 
the functions of the CFPB, including whether the information will have 
practical utility; (b) The accuracy of the CFPB's estimate of the 
burden of the collection of information, including the validity of the 
methods and the assumptions used; (c) Ways to enhance the quality, 
utility, and clarity of the information to be collected; and (d) Ways 
to minimize the burden of the collection of information on respondents, 
including through the use of automated collection techniques or other 
forms of information technology. Comments submitted in response to this 
notice will be summarized and/or included in the request for OMB's 
approval. All comments will become a matter of public record.

Anthony May,
Paperwork Reduction Act Officer, Consumer Financial Protection Bureau.
