SECURITIES AND EXCHANGE COMMISSION

[SEC File No. 270-563, OMB Control No. 3235-0626]


Proposed Collection; Comment Request; Extension: Rule 17g-3

Upon Written Request, Copies Available From: Securities and Exchange 
Commission, Office of FOIA Services. 100 F Street NE, Washington, DC 
20549-2736.

    Notice is hereby given that pursuant to the Paperwork Reduction Act 
of 1995 (44 U.S.C. 3501 et seq.), the Securities and Exchange 
Commission (``Commission'') is soliciting comments on the existing 
collection of information provided for in Rule 17g-3 (17 CFR 240.17g-3) 
under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 (15 U.S.C. 78a et seq.). The 
Commission plans to submit this existing collection of information to 
the Office of Management and Budget for extension and approval.
    Rule 17g-3 contains certain reporting requirements for NRSROs. 
Specifically, NRSROs are required to file with the Commission, on an 
annual basis, financial reports containing specified financial 
statements, certain financial condition reports, and a report on the 
internal control structure. NRSROs are also required to furnish a 
report of the number of credit rating actions taken during the most 
recently completed fiscal year. Currently, there are 10 credit rating 
agencies registered as NRSROs with the Commission. Based on staff 
experience, the Commission estimates that the total burden for 
respondents to comply with Rule 17g-3 is 3,650 hours. In addition, the 
Commission estimates an industry-wide annual external cost to NRSROs of 
$350,000 to comply with Rule 17g-3, reflecting costs to engage the 
services of independent public accountants and outside counsel.
    Written comments are invited on: (a) whether the proposed 
collection of information is necessary for the proper performance of 
the functions of the Commission, including whether the information 
shall have practical utility; (b) the accuracy of the Commission's 
estimates of the burden of the proposed collection of information; (c) 
ways to enhance the quality, utility, and clarity of the information on 
respondents; and (d) ways to minimize the burden of the collection of 
information on respondents, including through the use of automated 
collection techniques or other forms of information technology. 
Consideration will be given to comments and suggestions submitted by 
April 8, 2024.
    An agency may not conduct or sponsor, and a person is not required 
to respond to, a collection of information unless it displays a 
currently valid OMB control number. Please direct your written comments 
to: Dave Bottom, Director/Chief Information Officer, Securities and 
Exchange Commission, c/o John Pezzullo, 100 F St NE, Washington, DC 
20549 or send an email to: <a href="/cdn-cgi/l/email-protection#431311021c0e222a2f212c3b033026206d242c35"><span class="__cf_email__" data-cfemail="37676576687a565e5b55584f7744525419505841">[email&#160;protected]</span></a>.

    Dated: February 2, 2024.
Sherry R. Haywood,
Assistant Secretary.
