I. Self-Regulatory Organization's Statement of the Terms of Substance 
of the Proposed Rule Change

    Cboe EDGX Exchange, Inc. (the ``Exchange'' or ``EDGX'') proposes to 
amend its Fee Schedule. The text of the proposed rule change is 
provided in Exhibit 5.
    The text of the proposed rule change is also available on the 
Exchange's website (<a href="http://markets.cboe.com/us/options/regulation/rule_filings/edgx/">http://markets.cboe.com/us/options/regulation/rule_filings/edgx/</a>), at the Exchange's Office of the Secretary, and at 
the Commission's Public Reference Room.

II. Self-Regulatory Organization's Statement of the Purpose of, and 
Statutory Basis for, the Proposed Rule Change

    In its filing with the Commission, the Exchange included statements 
concerning the purpose of and basis for the proposed rule change and 
discussed any comments it received on the proposed rule change. The 
text of these statements may be examined at the places specified in 
Item IV below. The Exchange has prepared summaries, set forth in 
sections A, B, and C below, of the most significant aspects of such 
statements.

A. Self-Regulatory Organization's Statement of the Purpose of, and 
Statutory Basis for, the Proposed Rule Change

1. Purpose
    The Exchange proposes to amend its Fee Schedule applicable to its 
equities trading platform (``EDGX Equities'') by modifying the rates 
associated with the Remove Volume Tiers. The Exchange proposes to 
implement these changes effective March 1, 2024.
    The Exchange first notes that it operates in a highly competitive 
market in which market participants can readily direct order flow to 
competing venues if they deem fee levels at a particular venue to be 
excessive or incentives to be insufficient. More specifically, the 
Exchange is only one of 16 registered equities exchanges, as well as a 
number of alternative trading systems and other off-exchange venues 
that do not have similar self-regulatory responsibilities under the 
Securities Exchange Act of 1934 (the ``Act''), to which market 
participants may direct their order flow. Based on publicly available 
information,\3\ no single registered equities exchange has more than 
16% of the market share. Thus, in such a low-concentrated and highly 
competitive market, no single equities exchange possesses significant 
pricing power in the execution of order flow. The Exchange in 
particular operates a ``Maker-Taker'' model whereby it pays rebates to 
members that add liquidity and assesses fees to those that remove 
liquidity. The Exchange's Fee Schedule sets forth the standard rebates 
and rates applied per share for orders that provide and remove 
liquidity, respectively. Currently, for orders in securities priced at 
or above $1.00, the Exchange provides a standard rebate of $0.00160 per 
share for orders that add liquidity and assesses a fee of $0.0030 per 
share for orders that remove liquidity.\4\ For orders in securities 
priced below $1.00, the Exchange provides a standard rebate of $0.00003 
per share for orders that add liquidity and assesses a fee of 0.30% of 
the total dollar value for orders that remove liquidity.\5\ 
Additionally, in response to the competitive environment, the Exchange 
also offers tiered pricing which provides Members opportunities to 
qualify for higher rebates or reduced fees where certain volume 
criteria and thresholds are met. Tiered pricing provides an incremental 
incentive for Members to strive for higher tier levels, which provides 
increasingly higher benefits or discounts for satisfying increasingly 
more stringent criteria.

---------------------------------------------------------------------------

Remove Volume Tiers
    Under footnote 1 of the Fee Schedule, the Exchange currently offers 
various Add/Remove Volume Tiers. In particular, the Exchange offers two 
Remove Volume Tiers that each provide a reduced fee for Members' 
qualifying orders yielding fee codes BB,\6\ N \7\ and W \8\ where a 
Member reaches certain add volume-based criteria. Currently, the 
Exchange assesses a reduced fee of $0.00275 per share in securities at 
or above $1.00 and 0.28% of dollar value for securities priced below 
$1.00 for orders appended with fee codes BB, N, or W that satisfy the 
criteria of Remove Volume Tier 1 and 2. The Exchange now proposes to 
increase the reduced fee to $0.00285 per share in securities at or 
above $1.00 for orders appended with fee codes BB, N, or W that satisfy 
the criteria of Remove Volume Tiers 1 and 2. There is no proposed 
change in the reduced fee assessed to securities priced below $1.00. 
The purpose of increasing the fee associated with the Remove Volume 
Tiers in securities priced at or above $1.00 is for business and 
competitive reasons, as the Exchange believes that increasing such fee 
as proposed would decrease the Exchange's expenditures with respect to 
transaction pricing in a manner that is still consistent with the 
Exchange's overall pricing philosophy of encouraging added liquidity.
---------------------------------------------------------------------------

    \6\ Fee code BB is appended to orders that remove liquidity from 
EDGX in Tape B securities.
    \7\ Fee code N is appended to orders that remove liquidity from 
EDGX in Tape C securities.
    \8\ Fee code W is appended to orders that remove liquidity from 
EDGX in Tape A securities.
---------------------------------------------------------------------------

2. Statutory Basis
    The Exchange believes the proposed rule change is consistent with 
the Act and the rules and regulations thereunder applicable to the 
Exchange and, in particular, the requirements of Section 6(b) of the 
Act.\9\ Specifically, the Exchange believes the proposed rule change is 
consistent with the Section

[[Page 19621]]

6(b)(5) \10\ requirements that the rules of an exchange be designed to 
prevent fraudulent and manipulative acts and practices, to promote just 
and equitable principles of trade, to foster cooperation and 
coordination with persons engaged in regulating, clearing, settling, 
processing information with respect to, and facilitating transactions 
in securities, to remove impediments to and perfect the mechanism of a 
free and open market and a national market system, and, in general, to 
protect investors and the public interest. Additionally, the Exchange 
believes the proposed rule change is consistent with the Section 
6(b)(5) \11\ requirement that the rules of an exchange not be designed 
to permit unfair discrimination between customers, issuers, brokers, or 
dealers as well as Section 6(b)(4) \12\ as it is designed to provide 
for the equitable allocation of reasonable dues, fees and other charges 
among its Members and other persons using its facilities.

---------------------------------------------------------------------------

    As described above, the Exchange operates in a highly competitive 
market in which market participants can readily direct order flow to 
competing venues if they deem fee levels at a particular venue to be 
excessive or incentives to be insufficient. The Exchange believes that 
its proposal to modify the reduced fee associated with Remove Volume 
Tiers 1 and 2 reflects a competitive pricing structure designed to 
incentivize market participants to direct their order flow to the 
Exchange, which the Exchange believes would enhance market quality to 
the benefit of all Members. In particular, the Exchange believes its 
proposal to modify the reduced fee associated with Remove Volume Tiers 
1 and 2 is reasonable, equitable, and consistent with the Act because 
such change is designed to decrease the Exchange's expenditures with 
respect to transaction pricing in order to offset some of the costs 
associated with the Exchange's current pricing structure, which 
provides various rebates for liquidity-adding orders, and the 
Exchange's operations generally, in a manner that is consistent with 
the Exchange's overall pricing philosophy of encouraging added 
liquidity. The proposed increased fee of $0.00285 per share is 
reasonable and appropriate because while it is slightly higher than the 
existing fee, it remains lower than other fees assessed by competing 
Exchanges in order to remove liquidity.\13\ The Exchange further 
believes that the proposed increase to the fee associated with Remove 
Volume Tiers 1 and 2 is not unfairly discriminatory because it applies 
to all Members equally, in that all Members will be assessed the higher 
fee upon satisfying the criteria associated with Remove Volume Tiers 1 
and 2.
---------------------------------------------------------------------------

    \13\ See e.g., Nasdaq Fee Schedule, Add and Remove Rates and 
MIAX Pearl Equities Fee Schedule, Remove Volume Tiers. Orders that 
remove liquidity on Nasdaq are assessed a fee of $0.0030 while 
orders that satisfy the criteria of the Remove Volume Tier on MIAX 
Pearl Equities are assessed a fee of $0.00290.
---------------------------------------------------------------------------

B. Self-Regulatory Organization's Statement on Burden on Competition

    The Exchange does not believe that the proposed rule change will 
impose any burden on competition that is not necessary or appropriate 
in furtherance of the purposes of the Act. Rather, as discussed above, 
the Exchange believes that the proposed changes would encourage the 
submission of additional order flow to a public exchange, thereby 
promoting market depth, execution incentives and enhanced execution 
opportunities, as well as price discovery and transparency for all 
Members. As a result, the Exchange believes that the proposed changes 
further the Commission's goal in adopting Regulation NMS of fostering 
competition among orders, which promotes ``more efficient pricing of 
individual stocks for all types of orders, large and small.''
    The Exchange believes the proposed rule changes do not impose any 
burden on intramarket competition that is not necessary or appropriate 
in furtherance of the purposes of the Act. Particularly, the proposed 
change to the reduced fee associated with Remove Volume Tiers 1 and 2 
does not impose an unnecessary burden as all Members will be subject to 
the higher fee assessed to orders that satisfy the criteria of Remove 
Volume Tiers 1 and 2. The Exchange does not believe the proposed 
changes burden competition, but rather, enhances competition as it is 
intended to increase the competitiveness of EDGX by amending existing 
pricing incentives in order to attract order flow and incentivize 
participants to increase their participation on the Exchange. Greater 
overall order flow, trading opportunities, and pricing transparency 
benefits all market participants on the Exchange by enhancing market 
quality and continuing to encourage Members to send orders, thereby 
contributing towards a robust and well-balanced market ecosystem.
    Next, the Exchange believes the proposed rule changes does not 
impose any burden on intermarket competition that is not necessary or 
appropriate in furtherance of the purposes of the Act. As previously 
discussed, the Exchange operates in a highly competitive market. 
Members have numerous alternative venues that they may participate on 
and direct their order flow, including other equities exchanges, off-
exchange venues, and alternative trading systems. Additionally, the 
Exchange represents a small percentage of the overall market. Based on 
publicly available information, no single equities exchange has more 
than 16% of the market share.\14\ Therefore, no exchange possesses 
significant pricing power in the execution of order flow. Indeed, 
participants can readily choose to send their orders to other exchange 
and off-exchange venues if they deem fee levels at those other venues 
to be more favorable. Moreover, the Commission has repeatedly expressed 
its preference for competition over regulatory intervention in 
determining prices, products, and services in the securities markets. 
Specifically, in Regulation NMS, the Commission highlighted the 
importance of market forces in determining prices and SRO revenues and, 
also, recognized that current regulation of the market system ``has 
been remarkably successful in promoting market competition in its 
broader forms that are most important to investors and listed 
companies.'' \15\ The fact that this market is competitive has also 
long been recognized by the courts. In NetCoalition v. Securities and 
Exchange Commission, the D.C. Circuit stated as follows: ``[n]o one 
disputes that competition for order flow is `fierce.' . . . As the SEC 
explained, `[i]n the U.S. national market system, buyers and sellers of 
securities, and the broker-dealers that act as their order-routing 
agents, have a wide range of choices of where to route orders for 
execution'; [and] `no exchange can afford to take its market share 
percentages for granted' because `no exchange possesses a monopoly, 
regulatory or otherwise, in the execution of order flow from broker 
dealers'. . . .''.\16\ Accordingly, the Exchange does not believe its 
proposed fee change imposes any burden on competition that is not 
necessary or appropriate in furtherance of the purposes of the Act.
