SECURITIES AND EXCHANGE COMMISSION

[SEC File No. 270-777, OMB Control No. 3235-0729]


Proposed Collection; Comment Request; Extension: Form N-CEN

Upon Written Request, Copies Available From: Securities and Exchange 
Commission, Office of FOIA Services, 100 F Street NE, Washington, DC 
20549-2736.

    Notice is hereby given that, pursuant to the Paperwork Reduction 
Act of 1995 (44 U.S.C. 3501 et seq.), the Securities and Exchange 
Commission (the ``Commission'') is soliciting comments on the 
collection of information summarized below. The Commission plans to 
submit this existing collection of information to the Office of 
Management and Budget for extension and approval.
    The title for the collection of information is ``Form N-CEN under 
the Investment Company Act of 1940.'' Form N-CEN is used to collect 
annual, census-type information for registered funds. Filers must 
submit this report electronically using the Commission's electronic 
filing system ``(EDGAR'') in Extensible Markup Language (``XML'') 
format. The purpose of Form N-CEN is to satisfy the filing and 
disclosure requirements of Section 30 of the Investment Company Act, 
and of rule 30a-1 thereunder.
    We estimate that the average annual hour burden to complete the 
generally applicable items on Form N-CEN response will be 18 hours per 
year. We estimate that the aggregate annual hour burden to complete the 
generally applicable items will be 59,490 hours per year. We therefore 
estimate that filers would have total average annualized paperwork 
related expenses related to complete the generally applicable items of 
$605,520 for reports on Form N-CEN.
    The requirements of this collection of information are mandatory. 
Responses will not be kept confidential. An agency may not conduct or 
sponsor, and a person is not required to respond to a collection of 
information unless it displays a currently valid control number.
    Written comments are invited on: (a) whether the proposed 
collection of information is necessary for the proper performance of 
the functions of the Commission, including whether the information 
shall have practical utility; (b) the accuracy of the Commission's 
estimate of the burden of the collection of information; (c) ways to 
enhance the

quality, utility, and clarity of the information collected; and (d) 
ways to minimize the burden of the collection of information on 
respondents, including through the use of automated collection 
techniques or other forms of information technology. Consideration will 
be given to comments and suggestions submitted by March 25, 2024.
    An agency may not conduct or sponsor, and a person is not required 
to respond to, a collection of information under the PRA unless it 
displays a currently valid OMB control number.
    Please direct your written comments to: David Bottom, Chief 
Information Officer, Securities and Exchange Commission, c/o John 
Pezzullo, 100 F Street NE, Washington, DC 20549 or send an email to:

Assistant Secretary.
