Board is directed to take every reasonable step to solicit comment. In 
determining whether to approve a collection of information, the Board 
will consider all comments received from the public and other agencies.
    During the comment period for this proposal, a copy of the proposed 
PRA OMB submission, including the draft reporting form and 
instructions, supporting statement (which contains more detail about 
the information collection and burden estimates than this notice), and 
other documentation, will be made available on the Board's public

Request for Comment on Information Collection Proposal

    The Board invites public comment on the following information 
collection, which is being reviewed under authority delegated by the 
OMB under the PRA. Comments are invited on the following:
    a. Whether the proposed collection of information is necessary for 
the proper performance of the Board's functions, including whether the 
information has practical utility;
    b. The accuracy of the Board's estimate of the burden of the 
proposed information collection, including the validity of the

maintenance, and purchase of services to provide information.
    At the end of the comment period, the comments and recommendations 
received will be analyzed to determine the extent to which the Board 
should modify the proposal.

Proposal Under OMB Delegated Authority To Extend for Three Years, With 
Revision, the Following Information Collection

    Collection title: Government Securities Dealers Reports.
    Collection identifier: FR 2004.
    OMB control number: 7100-0003.
    General description of collection: This information collection is 
comprised of the:
    <bullet> Weekly Report of Dealer Positions (FR 2004A),
    <bullet> Weekly Report of Cumulative Dealer Transactions (FR 
2004B),
    <bullet> Weekly Report of Dealer Financing and Fails (FR 2004C),
    <bullet> Weekly Report of Specific Issues (FR 2004SI),
    <bullet> Daily Report of Specific Issues (FR 2004SD),

[[Page 5540]]

    <bullet> Supplement to the Daily Report of Specific Issues (FR 
2004SD ad hoc),
    <bullet> Daily Report of Dealer Activity in Treasury Financing (FR 
2004WI),
    <bullet> Settlement Cycle Report of Dealer Fails and Transaction 
Volumes: Class A (FR 2004FA),
    <bullet> Settlement Cycle Report of Dealer Fails and Transaction 
Volumes: Class B (FR 2004FB),
    <bullet> Settlement Cycle Report of Dealer Fails and Transaction 
Volumes: Class C (FR 2004FC), and
    <bullet> Settlement Cycle Report of Dealer Fails and Transaction 
Volumes (FR 2004FM).
    The Federal Reserve Bank of New York, on behalf of the Federal 
Reserve System, collects data from primary dealers in the U.S. 
government securities market. Filing of these data is required to 
obtain the benefit of primary dealer status. The Federal Reserve uses 
these data to (1) monitor the condition of the U.S. government 
securities market in its Treasury market surveillance and analysis of 
the market and (2) assist and support the U.S. Department of the 
Treasury (Treasury) in its role as fiscal agent for Treasury financing 
operations. In addition, these data are used in the analysis of broad 
financial conditions and a range of financial stability issues.
    Proposed revisions: Since the last clearance, a new type of repo 
financing called ``sponsored general collateral repo'' has gained 
significant popularity among clients of primary dealers. Such type of 
financing is not separately listed in the current FR 2004C. To improve 
our ability to track the usage of this product by primary dealers, the 
Board proposes to revise the FR 2004C for each asset category by adding 
three columns to separately capture sponsored general collateral 
Triparty Repo financing by maturity tenors. The proposed revisions 
would be effective with the first applicable as of date, June 5, 2024.
    Frequency: Weekly, monthly, and event-generated.
    Respondents: Primary government security dealers.
    Total estimated number of respondents: 24.
    Total estimated change in burden: 1,310.
    Total estimated annual burden hours: 35,189.\1\

including more detailed burden estimates, can be found in the OMB 
Supporting Statement posted at <a href="https://www.federalreserve.gov/apps/reportingforms/home/review">https://www.federalreserve.gov/apps/reportingforms/home/review</a>. On the page displayed at the link, you 
can find the OMB Supporting Statement by referencing the collection 
identifier, FR 2004.

    Board of Governors of the Federal Reserve System, January 23, 
2024.

Deputy Associate Secretary of the Board.
