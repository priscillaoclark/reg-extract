Final Approval Under OMB Delegated Authority of the Extension for Three 
Years, Without Revision, of the Following Information Collection

    Collection title: Disclosure Requirements Associated with the 
Consumer Financial Protection Bureau's (CFPB) Regulation DD.
    Collection identifier: FR DD.
    OMB control number: 7100-0271.
    General description of collection: The Truth in Savings Act (TISA) 
was contained in the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation Improvement 
Act of 1991. The FR DD is the Board's information collection associated 
with the CFPB's Regulation DD, which implements TISA to assist 
consumers in comparing deposit accounts offered by institutions, 
principally through the disclosure of fees, the annual percentage 
yield, and other account terms.
    Frequency: The FR DD is triggered by specific events, and 
disclosures must be provided to consumers within the time periods 
established by TISA and Regulation DD. The Board currently estimates 
the frequency of disclosure as monthly, as more granular information 
(i.e., number of accounts subject to Regulation DD) is not readily 
available.
    Respondents: Except those that are supervised by the CFPB, the FR 
DD panel comprises state member banks, branches of foreign banks (other 
than federal branches and insured state branches of foreign banks), 
commercial lending companies owned or controlled by foreign banks, and 
organizations operating under section 25 of the Federal Reserve Act.
    Total estimated number of respondents: 770.
    Total estimated annual burden hours: 25,410.\1\

identifier, FR DD.
---------------------------------------------------------------------------

    Current actions: On August 18, 2023, the Board published an initial 
notice in the Federal Register (88 FR 56627) requesting public comment 
for 60 days on the extension, without revision, of the FR DD. The 
comment period for this notice expired on October 17, 2023. The Board 
did not receive any comments.

    Board of Governors of the Federal Reserve System, March 4, 2024.
