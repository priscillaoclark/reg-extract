SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION: On December 13, 2023, the Commission 
approved an NPRM proposing to require that futures commission 
merchants, swap dealers, and major swap participants establish, 
document, implement, and maintain an Operational Resilience Framework 
(ORF) reasonably designed to identify, monitor, manage, and assess 
risks relating to information and technology security, third-party 
relationships, and emergencies or other significant disruptions to 
normal business operations.\2\ The framework would include three 
components--an information and technology security program, a third-
party relationship program, and a business continuity and disaster 
recovery plan--supported by broad requirements relating to governance, 
training, testing, and recordkeeping. The proposed rule would also 
require certain notifications to the Commission and customers or 
counterparties. The Commission further proposed guidance relating to 
the management of risks stemming from third-party relationships.

    The ORF NPRM was published on the Commission's website on December 
18, 2023, making it available for public comment through March 2, 2024, 
for a total comment period of 75 days.\3\ In response to a request from 
commenters, the Commission is extending the comment period for the ORF 
NPRM by an additional 30 days to April 1, 2024, for a total comment 
period of 105 days.\4\ This extension of the comment period will allow 
interested persons additional time to analyze the proposal and prepare 
their comments.
