Source: FDIC.
Note: The annual burden estimate for a given collection is calculated in two steps. First, the total number of
  annual responses is calculated as the whole number closest to the product of the annual number of respondents
  and the annual number of responses per respondent. Then, the total number of annual responses is multiplied by
  the time per response and rounded to the nearest hour to obtain the estimated annual burden for that
  collection. This rounding ensures the annual burden hours in the table are consistent with the values recorded
  in the OMB's regulatory tracking system.

    General Description of Collection: Regulation B (12 CFR part 1002), 
issued by the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau (``CFPB''), 
prohibits creditors from discriminating against applicants on any bases 
specified by the Equal Credit Opportunity Act; imposes reporting, 
record keeping and disclosure requirements; establishes guidelines for 
gathering and evaluating credit information; and requires creditors to 
give applicants certain written notices.
    The information collection is being revised to include 10 new 
information collection requirements created by subpart B, (sections 
1002.101-1002.114),\1\ which addresses lending to small businesses. The 
total estimated annual burden for this information collection is 
1,184,019 hours, which represents an increase of 734,884 hours relative 
to the estimate of 449,135 reported by the OMB in 2021. The increase is 
primarily attributable to the inclusion of 10 new information 
collections introduced by subpart B, (sections 1002.101-1002.114) of 
the final rule issued by the CFPB in May 2023.

Protection Bureau, ``Small Business Lending Under the Equal Credit 
Opportunity Act'' at 88 FR 35150 (May 31, 2023).

    General Description of Collection: Section 214 of the FACT Act 
requires financial institutions that wish to share information about

have the opportunity to opt out of such marketing solicitations. The 
disclosure notices and consumer responses thereto comprise the elements 
of this collection of information. There is no change in the method or 
substance of the collection.

    OMB Number: 3064-0194.

Financial Company (CFC); or (2) a bridge financial company (BFC) which 
requires the approval of the FDIC, as receiver for the predecessor CFC 
and as the sole shareholder of the BFC (e.g., the BFC's sale of a 
significant business line).

Source: FDIC.

    General Description of Collection: The Covered Financial Company 
(CFC) Asset Purchaser Eligibility implements the statutory requirement 
that assets held by the FDIC in the course of liquidating any covered 
financial company not be sold to persons who contributed in specified 
ways to the demise of a covered financial company. The FDIC implemented 
this requirement in its regulations at 12 CFR 380.13. Prospective 
purchasers are required to complete and submit a Purchaser Eligibility 
Certification (PEC) to the FDIC. The PEC is a self-certification by a 
prospective purchaser that it does not fall into any of the categories 
of individuals or entities that are prohibited by statute or regulation 
from purchasing assets of a CFC. The PEC will be required of any 
individual or entity that is a potential purchaser of assets from the 
FDIC, whether in its corporate capacity or as a conservator or 
receiver, for (1) a CFC; or (2) a Bridge Financial Company (BFC).
    The FDIC is increasing the total burden associated with this 
collection from 5 hours to 165 hours. The estimate for the number of 
respondents has increased from 10 to 66. The responses per respondent 
is unchanged from the 2021 submission. The estimate for hours per 
response represents a 1.5-hour increase from the 2021 submission. This 
increase is due to a change in calculation methodology.

Request for Comment

    Comments are invited on: (a) Whether the collection of information 
is necessary for the proper performance of the FDIC's functions, 
including whether the information has practical utility; (b) the 
accuracy of the estimates of the burden of the information collection, 
including the validity of the methodology and assumptions used; (c) 
ways to enhance the quality, utility, and clarity of the information to 
be collected; and (d) ways to minimize the burden of the collection of 
information on respondents, including through the use of automated 
collection techniques or other forms of information technology. All 
comments will become a matter of public record.
