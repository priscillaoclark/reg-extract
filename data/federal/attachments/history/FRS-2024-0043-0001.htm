will consider all comments received from the public and other agencies.
    During the comment period for this proposal, a copy of the proposed 
PRA OMB submission, including the draft reporting form and 
instructions, supporting statement (which contains more detail about 
the information collection and burden estimates than this notice), and 
other documentation, will be made available on the Board's public

Request for Comment on Information Collection Proposal

    The Board invites public comment on the following information 
collection, which is being reviewed under authority delegated by the 
OMB under the PRA. Comments are invited on the following:
    a. Whether the proposed collection of information is necessary for 
the proper performance of the Board's functions, including whether the 
information has practical utility;
    b. The accuracy of the Board's estimate of the burden of the 
proposed information collection, including the validity of the 
methodology and assumptions used;
    c. Ways to enhance the quality, utility, and clarity of the 
information to be collected;
    d. Ways to minimize the burden of information collection on 
respondents, including through the use of automated collection 
techniques or other forms of information technology; and

maintenance, and purchase of services to provide information.
    At the end of the comment period, the comments and recommendations

Proposal Under OMB Delegated Authority To Extend for Three Years, 
Without Revision, Following Information Collection

    Collection title: Recordkeeping Requirements Associated with 
Regulation F.
    Collection identifier: FR F.
    OMB control number: 7100-0331.
    General description of collection: The Board's Regulation F--
Limitations on Interbank Liabilities (12 CFR part 206) establishes 
limits on depository institutions' credit exposure to individual 
correspondents in order to mitigate the risk that the failure of a 
correspondent would pose to an insured depository institution.\1\ 
Section 206.3 of Regulation F requires insured depository institutions 
to establish and maintain policies and procedures designed to prevent 
excessive exposure to correspondents.
---------------------------------------------------------------------------

    \1\ Correspondent means a U.S. depository institution or a 
foreign bank to which a bank has exposure but does not include a 
commonly controlled correspondent. 12 CFR 206.2(c).
---------------------------------------------------------------------------

    Frequency: This information collection contains recordkeeping 
requirements. The creation of written policies and procedures 
concerning interbank liabilities is a mandatory one-time requirement. 
Subsequent changes to these policies and procedures would be on 
occasion, and they must be reviewed and approved by the depository 
institution's board of directors at least annually. The policies and 
procedures must be maintained, as amended.
    Respondents: All depository institutions insured by the Federal 
Deposit Insurance Corporation (FDIC).\2\
---------------------------------------------------------------------------

    \2\ The Board takes burden under the Paperwork Reduction Act 
with respect to all such entities.
---------------------------------------------------------------------------

    Total estimated number of respondents: 4,655.
    Total estimated annual burden hours: 4,753.\3\
---------------------------------------------------------------------------

    \3\ More detailed information regarding this collection, 
including more detailed burden estimates, can be found in the OMB 
Supporting Statement posted at <a href="https://www.federalreserve.gov/apps/reportingforms/home/review">https://www.federalreserve.gov/apps/reportingforms/home/review</a>. On the page displayed at the link, you 
can find the OMB Supporting Statement by referencing the collection 
identifier, FR F.
