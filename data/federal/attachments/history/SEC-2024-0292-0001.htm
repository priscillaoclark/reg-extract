Proposed Collection; Comment Request; Extension: Rule 18a-8

    Upon Written Request, Copies Available From: Securities and 
Exchange Commission, Office of FOIA

[[Page 15916]]

Services, 100 F Street NE, Washington, DC 20549-2736.
    Notice is hereby given that pursuant to the Paperwork Reduction Act 
of 1995 (``PRA'') (44 U.S.C. 3501 et seq.), the Securities and Exchange 
Commission (``Commission'') is soliciting comments on the existing 
collection of information provided for in Rule 18a-8 (17 CFR 240.18a-
8), under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 (15 U.S.C. 78a et seq.). 
The Commission plans to submit this existing collection of information 
to the Office of Management and Budget (``OMB'') for extension and 
approval.
    Exchange Act Rule 18a-8 (17 CFR 240.18a-8) specifies the 
circumstances under which stand-alone security-based swap dealers 
(``SBSDs''), stand-alone major security-based swap participants 
(``MSBSPs''), bank SBSDs, and bank MSBSPs must notify the Commission 
about their financial or operational condition, as well as the form 
that the notice must take.
    The Commission estimates that the total hour burden under Rule 18a-
8 is approximately 5 burden hours per year, and the total cost burden 
is approximately $0 per year. There has been no change in the estimated 
total hour and cost burdens since the last approval of this information 
collection.
    Written comments are invited on: (a) Whether the proposed 
collection of information is necessary for the proper performance of 
the functions of the Commission, including whether the information 
shall have practical utility; (b) the accuracy of the Commission's 
estimates of the burden of the proposed collection of information; (c) 
ways to enhance the quality, utility, and clarity of the information 
collected; and (d) ways to minimize the burden of the collection of 
information on respondents, including through the use of automated 
collection techniques or other forms of information technology. 
Consideration will be given to comments and suggestions submitted by 
May 6, 2024.
    An agency may not conduct or sponsor, and a person is not required 
to respond to, a collection of information unless it displays a 
currently valid OMB control number.
    Please direct your written comments to: David Bottom, Director/
Chief Information Officer, Securities and Exchange Commission, c/o John 
Pezzullo, 100 F Street NE, Washington, DC 20549, or send an email to:

Sherry R. Haywood,
Assistant Secretary.
