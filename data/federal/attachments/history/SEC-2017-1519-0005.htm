SECURITIES AND EXCHANGE COMMISSION

[SEC File No. 270-213, OMB Control No. 3235-0220]


Submission for OMB Review; Comment Request; Extension: Rule 30b2-
1

Upon Written Request, Copies Available From: Securities and Exchange 
Commission, Office of FOIA Services, 100 F Street NE, Washington, DC 
20549-2736

    Notice is hereby given that, pursuant to the Paperwork Reduction 
Act of 1995 (44 U.S.C. 3501 et seq.), the Securities and Exchange 
Commission (the ``Commission'') has submitted to the Office of 
Management and Budget (``OMB'') a request for extension of the 
previously approved collection of information discussed below.
    Rule 30b2-1 (17 CFR 270.30b2-1) under the Investment Company Act of 
1940 (15 U.S.C. 80a-1 et seq.) (the ``Investment Company Act'') 
requires a registered management investment company (``fund'') to (1) 
file a report with the Commission on Form N-CSR (17 CFR 249.331 and 
274.128) not later than 10 days after the transmission of any report 
required to be transmitted to shareholders under rule 30e-1 under the 
Investment Company Act, and (2) file with the Commission a copy of 
every periodic or interim report or similar communication containing 
financial statements that is transmitted by or on behalf of such fund 
to any class of such fund's security holders and that is not required 
to be filed with the Commission under (1), not later than 10 days after 
the transmission to security holders. The purpose of the collection of 
information required by rule 30b2-1 is to meet the disclosure 
requirements of the Investment Company Act and certification 
requirements of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act of 2002 (Pub. L. 107-204, 116 
Stat. 745 (2002)) and to provide investors with information necessary 
to evaluate an interest in the fund.
    The Commission estimates that there are 2,728 funds, with a total 
of approximately 13,449 portfolios, that are governed by the rule. For 
purposes of this analysis, the burden associated with the requirements 
of rule 30b2-1 has been included in the collection of information 
requirements of rule 30e-1 (17 CFR 270.30e-1) and Form N-CSR, rather 
than the rule. The rule 30b2-1 information collection, however, imposes 
a one hour burden for administrative purposes and we are maintaining 
that one hour burden.
    The collection of information under rule 30b2-1 is mandatory. The 
information provided under rule 30b2-1 is not kept confidential. An 
agency may not conduct or sponsor, and a person is not required to 
respond to, a collection of information unless it displays a currently 
valid OMB control number.
    The public may view background documentation for this information 
collection at the following website: <a href="http://www.reginfo.gov">www.reginfo.gov</a>. Find this 
particular information collection by selecting ``Currently under 30-day 
Review--Open for Public Comments'' or by using the search function. 
Written comments and recommendations for the proposed information 
collection should be sent within 30 days of publication of this notice 
by March 8, 2024 to (i) <a href="/cdn-cgi/l/email-protection#cf828d97e180828de180869d8ee19c8a8c90abaabca490a0a9a9a6acaabd8fa0a2ade1aaa0bfe1a8a0b9"><span class="__cf_email__" data-cfemail="a1ece3f98feeece38feee8f3e08ff2e4e2fec5c4d2cafecec7c7c8c2c4d3e1ceccc38fc4ced18fc6ced7">[email&#160;protected]</span></a> and 
(ii) David Bottom, Director/Chief Information Officer, Securities and 
Exchange Commission, c/o John Pezzullo, 100 F Street NE, Washington, DC 
20549, or by sending an email to: <a href="/cdn-cgi/l/email-protection#1d4d4f5c42507c74717f72655d6e787e337a726b"><span class="__cf_email__" data-cfemail="154547544a58747c79777a6d556670763b727a63">[email&#160;protected]</span></a>.

    Dated: February 1, 2024.
Sherry R. Haywood,
Assistant Secretary.
