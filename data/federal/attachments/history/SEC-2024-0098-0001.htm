---------------------------------------------------------------------------

A. Statement of Purpose

    On September 1, 2023, the Commission ordered the SROs to act 
jointly in developing and filing with the Commission by October 23, 
2023, a proposed new single NMS plan to govern the public dissemination 
of real-time consolidated equity market data for NMS stocks.\7\ The 
SROs are filing the proposed Plan, as directed in the Amended Order. 
Following the implementation timelines discussed in Section A.3 below, 
the Plan would replace (1) the Consolidated Tape Association Plan 
(``CTA Plan''), (2) the Consolidated Quotation Plan (``CQ Plan''), and 
(3) the Joint Self-Regulatory Organization Plan Governing the 
Collection, Consolidation, and Dissemination of Quotation and 
Transaction Information for Nasdaq-Listed Securities Traded on 
Exchanges on an Unlisted Trading Privileges Basis (``UTP Plan''). The 
SROs propose that the Plan be in the form of a limited liability 
company agreement for a new company, CT Plan LLC (the ``Company''), 
with each SRO being a ``Member'' of the Company.
---------------------------------------------------------------------------

    \7\ See Amended Order, supra note 4.
---------------------------------------------------------------------------

    In addition to the provisions required by the Amended Order, the 
SROs have included the following additional provisions.
    The SROs have included in Section 5.3 that the Operating Committee 
does not need to establish Processor Selection Procedures if the 
Operating Committee initially selects the CQ Plan and CTA Plan's 
processor and the UTP Plan's processor to provide the same services to 
the Company that are currently provided under the CQ Plan, CTA Plan, 
and UTP Plan. Because the focus of the Amended Order is the selection 
of a new independent Administrator rather than new Processors, the SROs 
believe it is reasonable for the Operating Committee to have the option 
of continuing with the current processors without having to go through 
an extensive procedure for selecting the processors. The SROs believe 
that this option also allows for quicker implementation of the Plan by 
allowing the Operating Committee to focus on the selection of the new 
Administrator.
    Additionally, at the request of SEC Staff, the SROs have included a 
provision in Section 7.1 that, in the event of a Regulatory Halt and 
the relevant Processor is unable to disseminate notice of the 
Regulatory Halt, notice of the Regulatory Halt may be made via an 
alternate Processor, if available.
2. Governing or Constituent Documents
    Not applicable.
3. Implementation of Plan
    As set forth in the proposed Plan, and because the Members have 
already formed the Company as a limited liability company pursuant to 
the Delaware Limited Liability Company Act by filing a certificate of 
formation (the ``Certificate'') with the Delaware Secretary of State, 
the SROs propose that the Plan will become effective on the date (the 
``Effective Date'') when approved by the Commission pursuant to Rule 
608 of Regulation NMS as an NMS plan.
    The SROs propose that the Plan would become operative after the 
steps set forth in Exhibit F of the proposed Plan are completed. 
Generally, the SROs believe there are six workstreams associated with 
the implementation of the Plan:
    (1) Setting up the Plan's governance;
    (2) Developing Plan fees, policies, and data subscriber agreements;
    (3) Selecting the new Administrator;
    (4) Contract negotiations with the new Administrator;
    (5) Administrator setup; and
    (6) Retirement of the CTA Plan, CQ Plan, and UTP Plan.
    Within Exhibit F, the SROs have included the various steps 
comprising each workstream along with the timelines for completing each 
step. As identified in Exhibit F, some of the steps can be performed in 
parallel, and others have dependencies that need to be completed before 
they can begin. For example, a new Administrator cannot begin to set up 
operations until after the process to select such Administrator has 
been completed and the Plan has negotiated and executed a contract and 
related service level agreement with the selected Administrator. 
Likewise, the SROs believe that the fees and the policies of the 
proposed Plan--which cannot be determined until both an Operating 
Committee and Advisory Committee are convened--will drive the scope of 
the services that an Administrator will need to provide, which could 
impact the RFP responses of prospective bidders to become the 
Administrator. For example, if the Operating Committee decides to use a 
direct bill model, which is currently used by the CQ Plan and CTA Plan, 
the scope of the work of the Administrator would be materially 
different than if the Operating Committee determines to proceed with an 
indirect bill model, which is currently used by the UTP Plan. Other 
aspects of the potential fees and policies of the proposed Plan, such 
as whether there will be differences in professional and non-
professional device fees, whether to provide an option to charge fees 
based on use of quote meter, or whether the current non-display use 
reporting will continue, will likewise have a material impact on the 
scope of services that the Administrator would be required to provide.
    While the SROs will work expeditiously to complete the various 
steps outlined in Exhibit F, the timelines in Exhibit F are estimates 
based on the experience of the SROs and the current administrators. As 
a result, it is possible that the steps may take shorter or longer than 
estimated. Consequently, as set forth in Section 14.1, in the event a 
workstream listed in Exhibit F takes shorter or, due to factors outside 
the Operating Committee's reasonable control, takes longer than 
expected, the timelines for contingent steps shall be adjusted 
accordingly to account for such change. In such instances, the 
Operating Committee will include the adjustment in its written progress 
report to the Commission in accordance with Section 14.2. The SROs 
believe that such an approach is reasonable since although the 
timelines

[[Page 5004]]

contained in Exhibit F are based on the SROs' and current 
administrators' experience, the ability to shorten or, in certain 
circumstances, lengthen the timeline reflected in Exhibit F is 
necessary due to factors outside the Operating Committee's reasonable 
control.
    For example, the proposed timeline for the Request for Proposal 
(``RFP'') process to select a new Administrator does not take into 
account the potential need for additional rounds of communications from 
bidders. It is not unusual in an RFP bidding process to have multiple 
rounds of communications from bidders. For example, the OPRA RFP 
process in 2019 was projected to take four months and ended up taking 
14 months to provide time for the bidders to respond to questions from 
the OPRA Plan.
    Additionally, the SROs have budgeted four months for negotiations 
with the selected administrator to execute a contract. While the SROs 
recognize that the key terms of the services to be provided will be 
part of the RFP process, the actual contract negotiations cannot begin 
until an administrator is selected. The SROs note that it took 
approximately ten months to negotiate a new contract with the UTP 
Processor following the 2014 RFP process. While the new Operating 
Committee will be committed to negotiate in good faith, the SROs cannot 
anticipate all possible outcomes when negotiating at arms-length with a 
third party. Such negotiations could be more streamlined than 
anticipated and take shorter than estimated or could be protracted due 
to disagreements between the Operating Committee and the new 
Administrator as to terms that might not be covered in the RFP process.
    Further, the SROs have set what they consider to be an aggressive 
timeline for the Administrator to set up operations. Assuming the new 
Administrator commits to such a timeline (which will be one of the 
elements of the RFP), the SROs note that there are dependencies outside 
of the control of either the Operating Committee and the new 
Administrator. Specifically, all vendors will need to be onboarded to 
the new Administrator before the new CT Plan can begin operations. The 
SROs note that when the UTP Plan repapered its customers, the process 
took over twelve months. Currently, there are over 600 vendors that 
take CQ/CTA and UTP data, and all those vendors would need to be 
onboarded so that there will be no disruption in service of 
consolidated data. If all 600+ vendors quickly complete the onboarding 
process, the onboarding process could take shorter than estimated; 
however, a few vendors delaying their onboarding could extend the 
entire process if a material number of data subscribers would be 
impacted.
    The above examples are non-exhaustive, and the SROs are unable to 
predict all issues that might arise in the implementation process. As a 
result, the SROs have included the ability to shorten or lengthen the 
timelines set forth in Exhibit F. In order to lengthen the timelines, 
the SROs have included a requirement that any decision to lengthen the 
timeline must be made by an affirmative vote of the Operating Committee 
pursuant to Section 4.3(b) and must be based on a reasonable 
determination that the timeline needs to be extended. Additionally, as 
stated above, the Operating Committee will include the adjustment in 
its written progress report to the Commission in accordance with 
Section 14.2.
4. Development and Implementation Phases
    Until the Operative Date, the SROs will continue to operate 
pursuant to the CQ Plan, CTA Plan, and UTP Plan with respect to the 
public dissemination of real-time consolidated equity market data for 
NMS stocks rather than the Plan.
5. Analysis of Impact on Competition
    The SROs believe the proposed Plan complies with the Amended Order. 
The proposed Plan incorporates the existing substantive provisions of 
the CTA Plan, CQ Plan and UTP Plan, which have been approved by the 
Commission, together with the governance modifications required by the 
Commission's Amended Order.
6. Written Understanding or Agreements Relating to Interpretation of, 
or Participation in, Plan
    Not applicable.
7. Approval of Amendment of the Plan
    Not applicable.
8. Terms and Conditions of Access
    The Plan provides that any entity registered as a national 
securities exchange or national securities association under the 
Exchange Act may become a Member by: (i) providing written notice to 
the Company, (ii) executing a joinder to the Plan, at which time 
Exhibit A of the Plan shall be amended to reflect the addition of such 
exchange or association as a Member, (iii) paying a Membership Fee to 
the Company, and (iv) executing a joinder to any other agreements to 
which all of the other Members have been made party in connection with 
being a Member.
9. Method of Determination and Imposition, and Amount of Fees and 
Charges
    Not applicable.
10. Method and Frequency of Processor Evaluation
    Not applicable
11. Dispute Resolution
    The Plan does not include provisions regarding resolution of 
disputes between or among the Members.

III. Solicitation of Comments

    The Commission seeks comment on the proposed CT Plan. Interested 
persons are invited to submit written data, views, and comments 
concerning the foregoing, including whether the proposal is consistent 
with the Act and the rules thereunder, as well as with the Amended 
Order. In addition to the specific questions set forth below, the 
Commission asks commenters to consider generally whether the proposed 
CT Plan is appropriately structured, and whether its provisions are 
appropriately drafted, to support the ``prompt, accurate, reliable, and 
fair collection, processing, distribution, and publication of

the purposes of the Act; \9\
---------------------------------------------------------------------------

    \9\ See 17 CFR 242.608(b)(2)
---------------------------------------------------------------------------

    3. Whether modifications to the proposed CT Plan, or conditions to

respectively, or this Agreement, as and when due, (i) each Member shall

return any such money or property to any Person; provided, however, 
that a Member shall be required to return to the Company any money or 
property distributed to it in clear and manifest accounting or similar 
error or as otherwise provided in Section 3.7(b). However, if any court

this Agreement, any Member is obligated to make any such payment, such 
obligation shall be the obligation of such Member and not of the 
Operating Committee.
    (d) No Member (unless duly authorized by the Operating Committee) 
has the authority or power to represent, act for, sign for or bind the 
Company or to make any expenditure on behalf of the Company; provided, 
however, that the Tax Matters Partner may represent, act for, sign for 
or bind the Company as permitted under Sections 10.2 and 10.3 of this 
Agreement.
    (e) To the fullest extent permitted by law, no Member shall, in its

Company or to any other Member other than the duties expressly set 
forth in this Agreement.

``SRO Applicant Observer''). Each SRO Applicant may designate an 
alternate individual or individuals who shall be authorized to act as 
the SRO Applicant Observer on behalf of the SRO Applicant in the 
absence of the designated SRO Applicant Observer. If the SRO 
Applicant's Form 1 petition or Section 19(b)(1) filing is withdrawn, 
returned, or is otherwise not actively pending with the Commission for 
any reason, then the SRO Applicant will no longer be eligible to have 
an SRO Applicant Observer attend Operating Committee meetings.
    (c) Notwithstanding anything to the contrary herein, (i) a national 
securities exchange that has ceased operations as a Market (or has yet 
to commence operation as a Market) and that is a Non-Affiliated SRO 
will not be permitted to designate a Voting Representative and (ii) an 
SRO Group in which all national securities exchanges have ceased 
operations as a Market (or have yet to commence operation as a Market) 
will not be permitted to designate a Voting Representative. Such SRO 
Group or Non-Affiliated SRO may attend the Operating Committee as an 
observer but may not attend the Executive Session of the Operating 
Committee. In the event such an SRO Group or Non-Affiliated SRO does 
not commence operation as a Market for six months after first attending 
an Operating Committee meeting, such SRO Group or Non-Affiliated SRO 
may no longer attend the Operating Committee until it commences/re-
commences operation as a Market.

Section 4.3 Action of Operating Committee.

    (a) Each Voting Representative shall be authorized to cast one vote 
on behalf of the SRO Group or Non-Affiliated SRO that he or she 
represents, provided, however, that each Voting Representative 
representing an SRO Group or Non-Affiliated SRO whose combined market 
center(s) have consolidated equity market share of more than fifteen 
(15) percent during four of the six calendar months preceding an 
Operating Committee vote shall be authorized to cast two votes. For 
purposes of this Section 4.3(a), ``consolidated equity market share'' 
means the average daily dollar equity trading volume of Eligible 
Securities of an SRO Group or Non-Affiliated SRO as a percentage of the 
average daily dollar equity trading volume of all of the SRO Groups and 
Non-Affiliated SROs, as reported under this Agreement or under the CQ, 
CTA, and UTP Plans. For the avoidance of doubt, FINRA shall not be 
considered to operate a market center within the meaning of this 
Section 4.3(a) solely by virtue of facilitating quoting on the FINRA 
Alternative Display Facility or trade reporting of Eligible Securities 
through the FINRA/Nasdaq Trade Reporting Facility Carteret, the FINRA/
Nasdaq Trade Reporting Facility Chicago, the FINRA/NYSE Trade Reporting 
Facility, or any other trade reporting facility that FINRA may operate 
from time to time in affiliation with a registered national securities 
exchange to provide a mechanism for FINRA Participants to report 
transactions in Eligible Securities effected otherwise than on an 
exchange.
    (b) All actions of the Operating Committee will require an 
affirmative vote of not less than (2/3rd) two-thirds of all votes 
allocated in the manner described in Section 4.3(a) to Voting 
Representatives who are eligible to vote on such action.
    (c) Notwithstanding Section 4.3(b), the following actions will 
require only a majority vote of the Operating Committee:
    (i) the selection of members of the Advisory Committee pursuant to 
Section 4.7;
    (ii) the decision to enter Executive Session pursuant to Section 
4.4(g), except for matters considered pursuant to Section 4.4(g)(i)(E);
    (iii) the decision to discuss a matter in a legal subcommittee 
pursuant to Section 4.8(d); and
    (iv) decisions concerning the operation of the Company as an LLC as 
specified in Section 10.3 and Section 11.2.

Section 4.4 Meetings of the Operating Committee.

    (a) Subject to Section 4.4(g), meetings of the Operating Committee 
may be attended by each Voting Representative, Member Observers, SRO 
Applicant Observers, Advisory Committee members, SEC staff, and other 
persons as deemed appropriate by the Operating Committee. Meetings 
shall be held at such times and locations as shall from time to time be 
determined by the Operating Committee. Member Observers shall be 
entitled to attend and participate in any discussion at any such 
meeting, unless attendance or participation would be inconsistent with 
the provisions of Section 4.11(b), but shall not be entitled to vote on 
any matter.

[[Page 5012]]

    (b) Special meetings of the Operating Committee may be called by 
the Chair on at least 24 hours' notice to each Voting Representative 
and all persons eligible to attend Operating Committee meetings.
    (c) Any action requiring a vote can be taken at a meeting only if a 
quorum of all Voting Representatives is present. A quorum is equal to 
the minimum votes necessary to obtain approval under Section 4.3(b), 
i.e., Voting Representatives reflecting 2/3rd of Operating Committee 
votes eligible to vote on such action.
    (i) Any Voting Representative recused from voting on a particular 
action (i) mandatorily pursuant to Section 4.10(b) or (ii) upon a 
Voting Representative's voluntary recusal, shall not be considered in 
the numerator or denominator of the calculations in paragraph (c) for 
determining whether a quorum is present.
    (ii) A Voting Representative is considered present at a meeting 
only if such Voting Representative is either in physical attendance at 
the meeting or participating by conference telephone or other 
electronic means that enables each Voting Representative to hear and be 
heard by all others present at the meeting.
    (d) A summary of any action sought to be resolved at a meeting 
shall be sent to each Voting Representative entitled to vote on such 
matter at least one week prior to the meeting via electronic mail, 
portal notification, or regular U.S. or private mail (or if one week is 
not practicable, then with as much time as may be reasonably 
practicable under the circumstances); provided, however, that this 
requirement to provide a summary of any action prior to a meeting may 
be waived by the vote of the percentage of the Committee required to 
vote on any particular matter, under Section 4.3 above.
    (e) Beginning with the first quarterly meeting of the Operating 
Committee following the Operative Date, the Chair of the Operating 
Committee shall be elected for a one-year term from the constituent 
Voting Representatives (and an election for the Chair shall be held 
every year). Subject to the requirements of Section 4.3 hereof, the 
Chair shall have the authority to enter into contracts on behalf of the 
Company and otherwise bind the Company, but only as directed by the 
Operating Committee. The Chair shall designate a Person to act as 
Secretary to record the minutes of each meeting. The location of 
meetings shall be in a location capable of holding the number of 
attendees of such meetings, or such other locations as may from time to 
time be determined by the Operating Committee.
    (i) To elect a Chair, the Operating Committee will elicit 
nominations for those individuals to be considered for Chair.
    (ii) In the event that no nominated Person is elected by an 
affirmative vote of the Operating Committee pursuant to Section 4.3, 
the Person(s) with the lowest number of votes will be eliminated from 
consideration. The Operating Committee will repeat this process until a 
Person is elected by affirmative vote of the Operating Committee 
pursuant to Section 4.3. In the event two candidates remain and neither 
is elected by an affirmative vote of the Operating Committee pursuant 
to Section 4.3, the Person receiving the most votes from Voting 
Representatives will be elected.
    (f) Meetings may be held by conference telephone or other 
electronic means that enables each Voting Representative to hear and be 
heard by all others present at the meeting.
    (g) Voting Representatives, Member Observers, SEC Staff, and other 
persons as deemed appropriate by a majority vote of the Voting 
Representatives may meet in Executive Session of the Operating 
Committee to discuss an item of business that falls within the topics 
identified in subsection (i) below and for which it is appropriate to 
exclude the Advisory Committee. A request to create an Executive 
Session must be included on the written agenda for an Operating 
Committee meeting, along with the clearly stated rationale as to why 
such item to be discussed would be appropriate for Executive Session. 
The creation of an Executive Session will be by a majority vote of 
Voting Representatives with votes allocated pursuant to Section 
4.3(a)(1). The Executive Session shall only discuss the topic for which 
it was created and shall be disbanded upon fully discussing the topic.
    (i) Items for discussion within an Executive Session should be 
limited to the following topics as:
    (A) Any topic that requires discussion of Highly Confidential 
Information;
    (B) Vendor or Subscriber Audit Findings;
    (C) Litigation matters;
    (D) Responses to regulators with respect to inquiries, 
examinations, or findings; and
    (E) Other discrete matters approved by the Operating Committee.
    (ii) The mere fact that a topic is controversial or a matter of 
dispute does not, by itself, make a topic appropriate for Executive 
Session. The minutes for an Executive Session shall include the reason 
for including any item in Executive Session.
    (iii) Requests to discuss a topic in Executive Session must be 
included on the written agenda for the Operating Committee meeting, 
along with the clearly stated rationale for each topic as to why such 
discussion is appropriate for Executive Session. Such rationale may be 
that the topic to be discussed falls within the list provided in 
subparagraph (g)(i).

Section 4.5 Certain Transactions.

    The fact that a Member or any of its Affiliates is directly or 
indirectly interested in or connected with any Person employed by the 
Company to render or perform a service, or from which or to whom the 
Company may buy or sell any property, shall not prohibit the Company 
from employing or dealing with such Person.

Section 4.6 Company Opportunities.

    (a) Each Member, its Affiliates, and each of their respective 
equity holders, controlling persons and employees may have business 
interests and engage in business activities in addition to those 
relating to the Company. Neither the Company nor any Member shall have 
any rights by virtue of this Agreement in any business ventures of any 
such Person.
    (b) Each Member expressly acknowledges that (i) the other Members 
are permitted to have, and may presently or in the future have, 
investments or other business relationships with Persons engaged in the 
business of the Company other than through the Company (an ``Other 
Business''), (ii) the other Members have and may develop strategic 
relationships with businesses that are and may be competitive or 
complementary with the Company, (iii) the other Members shall not be 
obligated to recommend or take any action that prefers the interests of 
the Company or any Member over its own interests, (iv) none of the 
other Members will be prohibited by virtue of their ownership of equity 
in the Company or service on the Operating Committee (or body 
performing similar duties) from pursuing and engaging in any such 
activities, (v) none of the other Members will be obligated to inform 
or present to the Company any such opportunity, relationship, or 
investment, (vi) such Member will not acquire or be entitled to any 
interest or participation in any Other Business as a result of the 
participation therein of any of the other Members, and (vii) the 
involvement of another Member in any Other Business in and of itself 
will not constitute a conflict of interest by such

[[Page 5013]]

Person with respect to the Company or any of the Members.

Section 4.7 Advisory Committee.

    (a) Formation. Notwithstanding any other provision of this Plan, an 
Advisory Committee to the Plan shall be formed and shall function in 
accordance with the provisions set forth in this section.
    (b) Composition. Members of the Advisory Committee shall be 
selected for two year terms as follows:
    (i) Operating Committee Selections. By affirmative vote of a 
majority of the Members entitled to vote, the Operating Committee shall 
select at least one representative from each of the following 
categories to be members of the Advisory Committee: (A) an 
institutional investor; (B) a broker-dealer with a predominantly retail 
investor customer base; (C) a broker-dealer with a predominantly

dealer, or investment adviser with third-party clients; (E) an issuer 
of NMS stock that is not affiliated or associated with a Member,

a Retail Representative. The Operating Committee shall not select any 
person employed by or affiliated with any Member or its affiliates or 
facilities.
    (ii) Member Selections. Each Member shall have the right to select 
one member of the Advisory Committee. A Member shall not select any

facilities.
    (c) Function. Members of the Advisory Committee shall have the 
right to submit their views to the Operating Committee on Plan matters, 
prior to a decision by the Operating Committee on such matters. Such 
matters shall include, but not be limited to, any new or modified 
product, fee, contract, or pilot program that is offered or used 
pursuant to the Plan.
    (d) Not Members of the Company. For the sake of clarity, members of 
the Advisory Committee are not Members of the Company.

Section 4.8 Subcommittees.

    (a) Subject to Section 4.1, the Operating Committee shall have the 
power and right, but not the obligation, to create and disband 
subcommittees of the Operating Committee and to determine the duties, 
responsibilities, powers, and composition of such subcommittees. 
Subcommittee chairs will be selected by the Operating Committee from 
Voting Representatives. Notwithstanding the foregoing, the Operating 
Committee may not delegate to a subcommittee those administrative 
functions to be performed by the Administrator.
    (b) Except as provided in Section 4.8(d), the Secretary or designee 
shall prepare minutes of all subcommittee meetings and such minutes 
will be made available to the Operating Committee and members of the 
Advisory Committee.
    (c) Voting Representatives, the Advisory Committee, Member 
Observers, SEC Staff, and other persons as deemed appropriate by the

the Voting Representatives may meet in a subcommittee to discuss an 
item that exclusively affects the Members with respect to: (1) 
litigation matters or responses to regulators with respect to 
inquiries, examinations, or findings; and (2) other discrete legal 
matters approved by the Operating Committee. The Secretary shall 
prepare the minutes of such subcommittee's meetings, and such minutes 
shall include, (i) attendance at the meeting; (ii) the subject matter 
of each item discussed; (iii) sufficient non-privileged information to 
identify the rationale for referring the matter to the legal 
subcommittee, and (iv) the privilege or privileges claimed with respect 
to that item. Such minutes will be made available only to the Voting 
Representatives, Member Observers, and other persons deemed appropriate 
by a majority vote of the Operating Committee.

Section 4.9 Officers.

    (a) Except as provided in Section 4.4(e), the Operating Committee 
may (but need not), from time to time, designate and appoint one or 
more persons as an Officer of the Company. Other than the Chair, no 
Officer need be a Voting Representative. Any Officers so designated 
shall have such authority and perform such duties as the Operating 
Committee may, from time to time, delegate to them. Any such delegation 
may be revoked at any time by the Operating Committee. The Operating 
Committee may assign titles to particular Officers. Each Officer shall 
hold office until such Officer's successor shall be duly designated or 
until such Officer's death, resignation, or removal as provided in this 
Agreement. Any number of offices may be held by the same individual. 
Officers shall not be entitled to receive salary or other compensation, 
unless approved by the Operating Committee.
    (b) Any Officer may resign at any time. Such resignation shall be 
made in writing and shall take effect at the time specified in the 
notice, or if no time be specified, at the time of its receipt by the 
Operating Committee. The acceptance of a resignation shall not be 
necessary to make it effective.
    (c) Any Officer may be removed at any time upon the majority vote 
of the Members.

Section 4.10 Commission Access to Information and Records.

    Nothing in this Agreement shall be interpreted to limit or impede 
the rights of the Commission or SEC staff to access information and 
records of the Company or any of the Members (including their 
employees) pursuant to U.S. federal securities laws and the rules and 
regulations promulgated thereunder.

Section 4.11 Disclosure of Potential Conflicts of Interest; Recusal.

    (a) Disclosure Requirements. The Members (including any Member 
Observers), the Processors, the Administrator, and each service 
provider or subcontractor engaged in Company business (including the 
audit of Subscribers' data usage) that has access to Restricted or 
Highly Confidential information (for purposes of this section, 
``Disclosing Parties'') shall complete the applicable questionnaire to 
provide the required disclosures set forth in subsection (c) below to 
disclose all material facts necessary to identify potential conflicts 
of interest. The Operating Committee, a Member, Processors, or 
Administrator may not use a service provider or subcontractor on 
Company business unless that service provider or subcontractor has 
agreed in writing to provide the disclosures required by this section 
and has submitted completed disclosures to the Administrator prior to 
starting work. If state laws, rules, or regulations, or applicable 
professional ethics rules or standards of conduct, would act to 
restrict or prohibit a Disclosing Party from making any particular 
required disclosure, a Disclosing Party shall refer to such law, rule, 
regulation, or professional ethics rule or standard and include in 
response to that disclosure the basis for its inability to provide a 
complete response. This does not relieve the Disclosing Party from 
disclosing any information it is not restricted from providing.
    (i) A potential conflict of interest may exist when personal, 
business, financial,

[[Page 5014]]

or employment relationships could be perceived by a reasonable 
objective observer to affect the ability of a person to be impartial.
    (ii) Updates to Disclosures. Following a material change in the 
information disclosed pursuant to Section 4.11(a), a Disclosing Party 
shall promptly update its disclosures. Additionally, a Disclosing Party 
shall update annually any inaccurate information prior to the Operating 
Committee's first quarterly meeting of a calendar year.
    (iii) Public Dissemination of Disclosures. The Disclosing Parties 
shall provide the Administrator with its disclosures and any required 
updates. The Administrator shall ensure that the disclosures are 
promptly posted to the Company's website.
    (iv) The Company will arrange for Disclosing Parties that are not 
Members or members of the Advisory Committee to comply with the 
required disclosures and recusals under this Section 4.11 and Exhibit B 
in their respective agreements with either the Company, a Member, the 
Administrator, or the Processors.
    (b) Recusal.
    (i) A Disclosing Party that is a Member may not appoint as its 
Voting Representative, alternate Voting Representative, or a Member 
Observer a person that is responsible for or involved with the 
procurement for, or development, modeling, pricing, licensing 
(including all functions related to monitoring or ensuring a 
subscriber's compliance with the terms of the license contained in its 
data subscription agreement and all functions relating to the auditing 
of subscriber data usage and payment), or sale of PDP offered to 
customers of the CT Feeds if the person has a financial interest 
(including compensation) that is tied directly to the Disclosing 
Party's market data business or the procurement of market data and if 
that compensation would cause a reasonable objective observer to expect 
the compensation to affect the impartiality of the representative.
    (ii) A Disclosing Party (including its representative(s), 
employees, and agents) will be recused from participating in Company 
activities if it has not submitted a required disclosure form or the 
Operating Committee votes that its disclosure form is materially 
deficient. The recusal will be in effect until the Disclosing Party 
submits a sufficiently complete disclosure form to the Administrator.
    (iii) A Disclosing Party, including its representative(s), and its 
Affiliates and their representative(s), are recused from voting on 
matters in which it or its Affiliate (i) is seeking a position or 
contract with the Company or (ii) have a position or contract with the 
Company and whose performance is being evaluated by the Company.
    (iv) All recusals, including a person's determination of whether to 
voluntarily recuse himself or herself, shall be reflected in the 
meeting minutes.
    (c) Required Disclosures. As part of the disclosure regime, the 
Members, the Processors, the Administrator, members of the Advisory 
Committee, and service providers and subcontractors must respond to 
questions that are tailored to elicit responses that disclose the 
potential conflicts of interest as set forth in Exhibit B.

Section 4.12 Confidentiality Policy.

    All Covered Persons are subject to the Confidentiality Policy set 
forth in Exhibit C to the Plan. The Company will arrange for Covered 
Persons that are not Voting Representatives, Member Observers, or 
members of the Advisory Committee to comply with the Confidentiality 
Policy under their respective agreements with either the Company, a 
Member, the Administrator, or the Processors.

Article V.

THE PROCESSORS; INFORMATION; INDEMNIFICATION

Section 5.1 General Functions of the Processors.

    Subject to the general direction of the Operating Committee, as 
more fully set forth in the agreement to be entered into between the 
Company and the Processors (the ``Processor Services Agreements''), the 
Company shall require the Processors to perform certain processing 
functions on behalf of the Company. Among other things, the Company 
shall require the Processors to collect from the Members, and 
consolidate and disseminate to Vendors and Subscribers, Transaction 
Reports and Quotation Information in Eligible Securities in a manner 
designed to assure the prompt, accurate, and reliable collection, 
processing, and dissemination of information with respect to all 
Eligible Securities in a fair and non-discriminatory manner.

Section 5.2 Evaluation of the Processors.

    The Processors' performance of their functions under the Processor 
Services Agreements shall be subject to review at any time as 
determined by a vote of the Operating Committee pursuant to Section 
4.3; provided, however, that a review shall be conducted at least once 
every two calendar years but not more frequently than once each 
calendar year (unless the Processors have materially defaulted in their 
obligations under the Processor Services Agreements and such default 
has not been cured within the applicable cure period set forth in the 
Processor Services Agreements, in which event such limitation shall not 
apply). The Operating Committee may review the Processors at staggered 
intervals.

Section 5.3 Process for Selecting New Processors.

    (a) No later than upon the termination or withdrawal of a Processor 
or the expiration of a Processor Services Agreement with a Processor, 
the Operating Committee shall establish procedures for selecting a new 
Processor (the ``Processor Selection Procedures''). The Operating 
Committee, as part of the process of establishing Processor Selection 
Procedures, may solicit and consider the timely comment of any entity 
affected by the operation of this Agreement. The Operating Committee 
will not need to establish Processor Selection Procedures if the 
Operating Committee initially selects the CQ Plan and CTA Plan's 
processor and the UTP Plan's processor to provide the same services to 
the Company that are currently provided under the CQ Plan, CTA Plan, 
and UTP Plan.
    (b) The Processor Selection Procedures shall be established by the 
affirmative vote of the Operating Committee pursuant to Section 4.3, 
and shall set forth, at a minimum:
    (i) the entity that will:
    (A) draft the Operating Committee's request for proposal for bids 
on a new Processor;
    (B) assist the Operating Committee in evaluating bids for the new 
Processor; and
    (C) otherwise provide assistance and guidance to the Operating 
Committee in the selection process;
    (ii) the minimum technical and operational requirements to be 
fulfilled by the Processor;
    (iii) the criteria to be considered in selecting the Processor; and
    (iv) the entities (other than Voting Representatives) that are 
eligible to comment on the selection of the Processor.

Section 5.4 Transmission of Information to Processors by Members.

    (a) Quotation Information.
    (i) Each Member shall, during the time it is open for trading, be 
responsible for promptly collecting and transmitting to the Processors 
accurate Quotation Information in Eligible Securities through any means 
set forth in the Processor Services Agreements to

[[Page 5015]]

ensure that the Company complies with its obligations under the 
Processor Services Agreements.
    (ii) Quotation Information shall include:
    (A) identification of the Eligible Security, using the Listing 
Market's symbol;
    (B) the price bid and offered, together with size;
    (C) for FINRA, the FINRA Participant along with the FINRA 
Participant's market participant identification or Member from which 
the quotation emanates;
    (D) appropriate timestamps;
    (E) identification of quotations that are not firm; and
    (F) through appropriate codes and messages, withdrawals and similar 
matters.
    (iii) In addition, Quotation Information shall include:
    (A) in the case of a national securities exchange, the reporting 
Member's matching engine publication timestamp; or
    (B) in the case of FINRA, the quotation publication timestamp that 
FINRA's bidding or offering member reports to FINRA's quotation 
facility in accordance with FINRA rules. In addition, if FINRA's 
quotation facility provides a proprietary feed of its quotation 
information, then the quotation facility shall also furnish the 
Processors with the time of the quotation as published on the quotation 
facility's proprietary feed. FINRA shall convert any quotation times 
reported to it to nanoseconds and shall furnish such times to the 
Processors in nanoseconds since Epoch.
    (h) Transaction Reports.
    (i) Each Member shall, during the time it is open for trading, be 
responsible for promptly transmitting to the Processor Transaction 
Reports in Eligible Securities executed in its Market by means set 
forth in the Processor Services Agreements.
    (ii) Transaction Reports shall include:
    (A) identification of the Eligible Security, using the Listing 
Market's symbol;
    (B) the number of shares in the transaction;
    (C) the price at which the shares were purchased or sold;
    (D) the buy/sell/cross indicator;
    (E) appropriate timestamps;
    (F) the Market of execution; and
    (G) through appropriate codes and messages, late or out-of-sequence 
trades, corrections, and similar matters.
    (iii) In addition, Transaction Reports shall include the time of 
the transaction as identified in the Member's matching engine 
publication timestamp. However, in the case of FINRA, the time of the 
transaction shall be the time of execution that a FINRA member reports 
to a FINRA trade reporting facility in accordance with FINRA rules. In 
addition, if the FINRA trade reporting facility provides a proprietary 
feed of trades reported by the trade reporting facility to the 
Processor, then the FINRA trade reporting facility shall also furnish 
the Processors with the time of the transmission as published on the 
facility's proprietary feed. The FINRA trade reporting facility shall 
convert times that its members report to it to nanoseconds and shall 
furnish such times to the Processors in nanoseconds since Epoch.
    (iv) Each Member shall (a) transmit all Transaction Reports in 
Eligible Securities to the Processors as soon as practicable, but not 
later than 10 seconds, after the time of execution, (b) establish and 
maintain collection and reporting procedures and facilities reasonably 
designed to comply with this requirement, and (c) designate as ``late'' 
any last sale price not collected and reported in accordance with the 
above-referenced procedures or as to which the Member has knowledge 
that the time interval after the time of execution is significantly 
greater than the time period referred to above. The Members shall seek 
to reduce the time period for reporting last sale prices to the 
Processors as conditions warrant.
    (v) The following types of transactions are not required to be 
reported to the Processors pursuant to this Agreement:
    (A) transactions that are part of a primary distribution by an 
issuer or of a registered secondary distribution or of an unregistered 
secondary distribution;
    (B) transactions made in reliance on section 4(a)(2) of the 
Securities Act of 1933;
    (C) transactions in which the buyer and the seller have agreed to 
trade at a price unrelated to the current market for the security 
(e.g., to enable the seller to make a gift);
    (D) the acquisition of securities by a broker-dealer as principal 
in anticipation of making an immediate exchange distribution or 
exchange offering on an exchange;
    (E) purchases of securities pursuant to a tender offer;
    (F) purchases or sales of securities effected upon the exercise of 
an option pursuant to the terms thereof or the exercise of any other 
right to acquire securities at a pre-established consideration 
unrelated to the current market; and
    (G) transfers of securities that are expressly excluded from trade 
reporting under FINRA rules.
    (c) The following symbols shall be used to denote the applicable 
Member:

    (d) Indemnification.
    (i) Each Member agrees, severally and not jointly, to indemnify and 
hold harmless and defend the Company, each other Member, the 
Processors, the Administrator, the Operating Committee, and each of 
their respective directors, officers, employees, agents, and Affiliates 
(each, an ``Member Indemnified Party'') from and against any and all 
loss, liability, claim, damage, and expense whatsoever incurred or 
threatened against such Member Indemnified Party as a result of a 
system error or disruption at such Member's Market affecting any 
Transaction Reports, Quotation Information, or other information 
reported to the Processors by such Member and disseminated by the 
Processors to Vendors and Subscribers. This indemnity shall be in 
addition to any liability that the indemnifying Member may otherwise 
have.
    (ii) Promptly after receipt by a Member Indemnified Party of notice 
of the commencement of any action, such Member Indemnified Party will, 
if it intends to make a claim in respect thereof against an 
indemnifying Member, notify the indemnifying Member in writing of the 
commencement thereof; provided, however, that the failure to so notify 
the indemnifying Member will only relieve the indemnifying Member from 
any liability which it may have to any Member Indemnified Party to the 
extent such indemnifying Member is actually prejudiced by such failure. 
In case any such action is brought against any Member Indemnified Party 
and it

[[Page 5016]]

promptly notifies an indemnifying Member of the commencement thereof, 
the indemnifying Member will be entitled to participate in, and, to the 
extent that it elects (jointly with any other indemnifying Member 
similarly notified), to assume and control the defense thereof with 
counsel chosen by it. After notice from the indemnifying Member of its 
election to assume the defense thereof, the indemnifying Member will 
not be liable to such Indemnified Party for any legal or other expenses 
subsequently incurred by such Member Indemnified Party in connection 
with the defense thereof but the Member Indemnified Party may, at its 
own expense, participate in such defense by counsel chosen by it 
without, however, impairing the indemnifying Member's control of the 
defense. If the indemnifying Member has assumed the defense in 
accordance with the terms hereof, the indemnifying Member may enter 
into a settlement or consent to any judgment without the prior written 
consent of the Member Indemnified Party if (i) such settlement or 
judgment involves monetary damages only, all of which will be fully 
paid by the indemnifying Member and without admission of fault or 
culpability on behalf of any Member Indemnified Party, and (ii) a term 
of the settlement or judgment is that the Person or Persons asserting 
such claim unconditionally and irrevocably release all Member 
Indemnified Parties from all liability with respect to such claim; 
otherwise, the consent of the Member Indemnified Party shall be 
required in order to enter into any settlement of, or consent to the 
entry of a judgment with respect to, any claim (which consent shall not 
be unreasonably withheld, delayed, or conditioned).

Section 5.5 Operational Issues.

    (a) Each Member shall be responsible for collecting and validating 
quotes and last sale reports within its own system prior to 
transmitting this data to the Processors.
    (b) Each Member may utilize a dedicated Member line into the 
Processors to transmit Transaction Reports and Quotation Information to 
the Processors.
    (c) Whenever a Member determines that a level of trading activity 
or other unusual market conditions prevent it from collecting and 
transmitting Transaction Reports or Quotation Information to the 
Processor, or where a trading halt or suspension in an Eligible 
Security is in effect in its Market, the Member shall promptly notify 
the Processors of such condition or event and shall resume collecting 
and transmitting Transaction Reports and Quotation Information to it as 
soon as the condition or event is terminated. In the event of a system 
malfunction resulting in the inability of a Member or its members to 
transmit Transaction Reports or Quotation Information to the 
Processors, the Member shall promptly notify the Processors of such 
event or condition. Upon receiving such notification, the Processors 
shall take appropriate action, including either closing the quotation 
or purging the system of the affected quotations.

Article VI.

THE ADMINISTRATOR

Section 6.1 General Functions of the Administrator.

    Subject to the general direction of the Operating Committee, as 
more fully set forth in the agreement entered into between the Company 
and the Administrator (the ``Administrative Services Agreement''), the 
Administrator shall perform administrative functions on behalf of the 
Company including recordkeeping; administering Vendor and Subscriber 
contracts; administering Fees, including billing, collection, and 
auditing of Vendors and Subscribers; administering Distributions; tax 
functions of the Company; the preparation of the Company's audited 
financial reports; and support of Company governance.

Section 6.2 Independence of the Administrator.

    The Administrator may not be owned or controlled by a corporate 
entity that, either directly or via another subsidiary, offers for sale 
its own PDP.

Section 6.3 Evaluation of the Administrator.

    The Administrator's performance of its functions under the 
Administrative Services Agreement shall be subject to review at any 
time as determined by an affirmative vote of the Operating Committee 
pursuant to Section 4.3; provided, however, that a review shall be 
conducted at least once every two calendar years but not more 
frequently than once each calendar year (unless the Administrator has 
materially defaulted in its obligations under the Administrative 
Services Agreement and such default has not been cured within the 
applicable cure period set forth in the Administrative Services 
Agreement, in which event such limitation shall not apply). The 
Operating Committee shall appoint a subcommittee or other Persons to 
conduct the review. The Company shall require the reviewer to provide 
the Operating Committee with a written report of its findings and to 
make recommendations (if necessary), including with respect to the 
continuing operation of the Administrator. The Administrator shall be 
required to assist and participate in such review. The Operating 
Committee shall notify the Commission of any recommendations it may 
approve as a result of the review of the Administrator and shall supply 
the Commission with a copy of any reports that may be prepared in 
connection therewith.

Section 6.4 Process for Selecting New Administrator.

    Prior to the Operative Date, upon the termination or withdrawal of 
the Administrator, or upon the expiration of the Administrative 
Services Agreement, the Operating Committee shall establish procedures 
for selecting a new Administrator (the ``Administrator Selection 
Procedures''). The Operating Committee, as part of the process of 
establishing Administrator Selection Procedures, may solicit and 
consider the timely comment of any entity affected by the operation of 
this Agreement. The Administrator Selection Procedures shall be 
established by the Operating Committee pursuant to Section 4.3, and 
shall set forth, at a minimum:
    (a) the entity that will:
    (i) draft the Operating Committee's request for proposal for bids 
on a new Administrator;
    (ii) assist the Operating Committee in evaluating bids for the new 
Administrator; and
    (iii) otherwise provide assistance and guidance to the Operating 
Committee in the selection process.
    (b) the minimum technical and operational requirements to be 
fulfilled by the Administrator;
    (c) the criteria to be considered in selecting the Administrator; 
and
    (d) the entities (other than Voting Representatives) that are 
eligible to comment on the selection of the Administrator.

Article VII.

REGULATORY MATTERS

Section 7.1 Regulatory and Operational Halts.

    (a) Operational Halts. A Member shall notify the Processors if it 
has concerns about its ability to collect and transmit quotes, orders, 
or last sale prices, or where it has declared an Operational Halt or 
suspension of trading in one or more Eligible Securities, pursuant to 
the procedures adopted by the Operating Committee.
    (b) Regulatory Halts.
    (i) The Primary Listing Market may declare a Regulatory Halt in 
trading for

[[Page 5017]]

any security for which it is the Primary Listing Market:
    (A) as provided for in the rules of the Primary Listing Market;
    (B) if it determines there is a SIP Outage, Material SIP Latency, 
or Extraordinary Market Activity; or
    (C) in the event of national, regional, or localized disruption 
that necessitates a Regulatory Halt to maintain a fair and orderly 
market.
    (ii) In making a determination to declare a Regulatory Halt under 
subparagraph (b)(i), the Primary Listing Market will consider the 
totality of information available concerning the severity of the issue, 
its likely duration, and potential impact on Member Firms and other 
market participants and will make a good-faith determination that the 
criteria of subparagraph (b)(i) have been satisfied and that a 
Regulatory Halt is appropriate. The Primary Listing Market will 
consult, if feasible, with the affected Trading Center(s), the other 
Members, or the Processors, as applicable, regarding the scope of the 
issue and what steps are being taken to address the issue. Once a 
Regulatory Halt under subparagraph (b)(i) has been declared, the 
Primary Listing Market will continue to evaluate the circumstances to 
determine when trading may resume in accordance with the rules of the 
Primary Listing Market.
    (c) Initiating a Regulatory Halt.
    (i) The start time of a Regulatory Halt is when the Primary Listing 
Market declares the halt, regardless of whether an issue with 
communications impacts the dissemination of the notice.
    (ii) If a Processor is unable to disseminate notice of a Regulatory 
Halt or the Primary Listing Market is not open for trading, the Primary 
Listing Market will take reasonable steps to provide notice of a 
Regulatory Halt, which shall include both the type and start time of 
the Regulatory Halt, by dissemination through:
    (A) PDP;
    (B) posting on a publicly-available Member website;
    (C) system status messages; or
    (D) a notification via an alternate Processor, if available.
    (iii) Except in exigent circumstances, the Primary Listing Market 
will not declare a Regulatory Halt retroactive to a time earlier than 
the notice of such halt.
    (iv) Resumption of Trading After Regulatory Halts Other Than SIP 
Halts. The Primary Listing Market will declare a resumption of trading 
when it makes a good-faith determination that trading may resume in a 
fair and orderly manner and in accordance with its rules.
    (v) For a Regulatory Halt that is initiated by another Member that 
is a Primary Listing Market, a Member may resume trading after the 
Member receives notification from the Primary Listing Market that the 
Regulatory Halt has been terminated.
    (d) Resumption of Trading After SIP Halt.
    (i) The Primary Listing Market will determine the SIP Halt Resume 
Time. In making such determination, the Primary Listing Market will 
make a good-faith determination and consider the totality of 
information to determine whether resuming trading would promote a fair 
and orderly market, including input from the Processors, the other 
Members, or the operator of the system in question (as well as any 
Trading Center(s) to which such system is linked), regarding 
operational readiness to resume trading. The Primary Listing Market 
retains discretion to delay the SIP Halt Resume Time if it believes 
trading will not resume in a fair and orderly manner.
    (ii) The Primary Listing Market will terminate a SIP Halt with a 
notification that specifies a SIP Halt Resume Time. The Primary Listing 
Market shall provide a minimum notice of a SIP Halt Resume Time, as 
specified by the rules of the Primary Listing Market, during which 
period market participants may enter quotes and orders in the affected 
securities. During Regular Trading Hours, the last SIP Halt Resume Time 
before the end of Regular Trading Hours shall be an amount of time as 
specified by the rules of the Primary Listing Market. The Primary 
Listing Market may stagger the SIP Halt Resume Times for multiple 
symbols in order to reopen in a fair and orderly manner.
    (iii) During Regular Trading Hours, if the Primary Listing Market 
does not open a security within the amount of time as specified by the 
rules of the Primary Listing Market after the SIP Halt Resume Time, a 
Member may resume trading in that security. Outside Regular Trading 
Hours, a Member may resume trading immediately after the SIP Halt 
Resume Time.
    (e) Member to Halt Trading During Regulatory Halt. A Member will 
halt trading for any security traded on its Market if the Primary 
Listing Market declares a Regulatory Halt for the security.
    (f) Communications. Whenever, in the exercise of its regulatory 
functions, the Primary Listing Market for an Eligible Security 
determines it is appropriate to initiate a Regulatory Halt, the Primary 
Listing Market will notify all other Members and the affected 
Processors of such Regulatory Halt as well as provide notice that a 
Regulatory Halt has been lifted using such protocols and other 
emergency procedures as may be mutually agreed to between the Members 
and the Primary Listing Market. The affected Processors shall 
disseminate to Members notice of the Regulatory Halt (as well as notice 
of the lifting of a Regulatory Halt) (i) through the CT Feeds or (ii) 
any other means the affected Processors, in its sole discretion, 
considers appropriate. Each Member shall be required to continuously 
monitor these communication protocols established by the Operating 
Committee and the Processors during market hours, and the failure of a 
Member to do so shall not prevent the Primary Listing Market from 
initiating a Regulatory Halt in accordance with the procedures 
specified herein.

Section 7.2 Hours of Operation of the System.

    (a) Quotation Information shall be entered, as applicable, by 
Members as to all Eligible Securities in which they make a market 
during Regular Trading Hours on all days the Processors are in 
operation. Transaction Reports shall be entered for executions that 
occur from 9:30 a.m. until 4:00:00 p.m. ET by Members as to all 
Eligible Securities in which they execute transactions during Regular 
Trading Hours on all days the Processors are in operation.
    (b) Members that execute transactions in Eligible Securities 
outside of Regular Trading Hours, shall report such transactions as 
follows:
    (i) transactions in Eligible Securities executed from 4:00 a.m. up 
to 9:30:00 a.m. ET (or as otherwise designated by a Member as an 
execution occurring outside of Regular Trading Hours) and after 4:00:00 
p.m. until 8:00 p.m. ET, shall be designated with an appropriate 
indicator to denote their execution outside normal market hours;
    (ii) transactions in Eligible Securities executed after 8:00 p.m. 
and before 12:00 a.m. (midnight) shall be reported to the Processors 
between the hours of 4:00 a.m. and 8:00 p.m. ET on the next business 
day (T+1), and shall be designated ``as/of'' trades to denote their 
execution on a prior day, and be accompanied by the time of execution;
    (iii) transactions in Eligible Securities executed between 12:00 
a.m. (midnight) and 4:00 a.m. ET shall be transmitted to the Processors 
between 4:00 a.m. and 9:30 a.m. ET, on trade date, shall be designated 
with an appropriate indicator to denote their execution outside normal 
market hours, and shall be accompanied by the time of execution; and

[[Page 5018]]

    (iv) transactions reported pursuant to this Section 7.3 shall be 
included in the calculation of total trade volume for purposes of 
determining Net Distributable Operating Revenue, but shall not be 
included in the calculation of the daily high, low, or last sale.
    (c) Late trades shall be reported in accordance with the rules of 
the Member in whose Market the transaction occurred and can be reported 
between the hours of 4:00 a.m. and 8:00 p.m. ET.
    (d) The Processors shall collect, process and disseminate Quotation 
Information in Eligible Securities at other times between 4:00 a.m. and 
9:30 a.m. ET, and after 4:00 p.m. ET, when any Member or FINRA 
Participant is open for trading, until 8:00 p.m. ET (the ``Additional 
Period''); provided, however, that the National Best Bid and Offer 
quotation will not be disseminated before 4:00 a.m. or after 8:00 p.m. 
ET. Members that enter Quotation Information or submit Transaction 
Reports to the Processors during the Additional Period shall do so for 
all Eligible Securities in which they enter quotations.

Article VIII.

CAPITAL CONTRIBUTIONS; CAPITAL ACCOUNTS

Section 8.1 Capital Accounts.

    (a) A separate capital account (``Capital Account'') shall be 
established by the Company and maintained by the Administrator for each 
Member in accordance with section 704(b) of the Code and Treasury 
Regulation section 1.704-1(b)(2)(iv). There shall be credited to each 
Member's Capital Account (i) the Capital Contributions (at fair market 
value in the case of contributed property) made by such Member (which 
shall be deemed to be zero for the initial Members), (ii) allocations 
of Company profits and gain (or items thereof) to such Member pursuant 
to Section 9.2 and (iii) any recaptured tax credits, or portion 
thereof, to the extent such increase to the tax basis of a Member's 
interest in the Company may be allowed pursuant to the Code. Each 
Member's Capital Account shall be decreased by (x) the amount of 
distributions (at fair market value in the case of property distributed 
in kind) to such Member, (y) allocations of Company losses to such 
Member (including expenditures which can neither by capitalized nor 
deducted for tax purposes, organization and syndication expenses not 
subject to amortization and loss on sale or disposition of the 
Company's assets, whether or not disallowed under sections 267 or 707 
of the Code) pursuant to Section 9.2 and (z) any tax credits, or 
portion thereof, as may be required to be charged to the tax basis of a 
Membership Interest pursuant to the Code. Capital Accounts shall not be 
adjusted to reflect a Member's share of liabilities under section 752 
of the Code.
    (b) The fair market value of contributed, distributed, or revalued 
property shall be agreed to by the Operating Committee or, if there is 
no such agreement, by an appraisal.
    (c) The foregoing provisions and the other provisions of this 
Agreement relating to the maintenance of Capital Accounts are intended 
to comply with Treasury Regulation section 1.704-1(b) promulgated under 
section 704(b) of the Code, and shall be interpreted and applied in a 
manner consistent with such Treasury Regulations.

Section 8.2 Additional Capital Contributions.

    Except with the approval of the Operating Committee or as otherwise 
provided in this Section 8.2, no Member shall be obligated or permitted 
to make any additional contribution to the capital of the Company. The 
Members agree to make additional Capital Contributions from time to 
time as appropriate in respect of reasonable administrative and other 
reasonable expenses of the Company.

Section 8.3 Distributions.

    Except as set forth in this Section 8.3 and Section 11.2, and 
subject to the provisions of Section 13.1, Distributions shall be made 
to the Members at the times and in the aggregate amounts set forth in 
Exhibit D. Notwithstanding any provisions to the contrary contained in 
this Agreement, the Company shall not make a Distribution to a Member 
on account of its interest in the Company if such Distribution would 
violate Section 18-607 of the Delaware Act or other Applicable Law. 
Distributions may be made in cash or, if determined by the Operating 
Committee, in-kind. The Operating Committee may reserve amounts for 
anticipated expenses or contingent liabilities of the Company. In the 
event that additional Capital Contributions are called for, and any 
Member fails to provide the full amount of such additional Capital 
Contributions as set forth in the relevant resolution of the Operating 
Committee, any Distributions to be made to such defaulting Member shall 
be reduced by the amount of any required but unpaid Capital 
Contribution due from such Member.

Article IX.

ALLOCATIONS

Section 9.1 Calculation of Profits and Losses.

    To the fullest extent permitted by Applicable Law, the profits and 
losses of the Company shall be determined for each fiscal year in a 
manner consistent with GAAP.

Section 9.2 Allocation of Profits and Losses.

    (a) Except as otherwise set forth in this Section 9.2, for Capital 
Account purposes, all items of income, gain, loss, and deduction shall 
be allocated among the Members in accordance with Exhibit D.
    (b) For federal, state and local income tax purposes, items of 
income, gain, loss, deduction, and credit shall be allocated to the 
Members in accordance with the allocations of the corresponding items 
for Capital Account purposes under this Section 9.2, except that items 
with respect to which there is a difference between tax and book basis 
will be allocated in accordance with Section 704(c) of the Code, the 
Treasury Regulations thereunder and Treasury Regulations Section 1.704-
1(b)(4)(i).
    (c) Notwithstanding any provision set forth in this Section 9.2, no 
item of deduction or loss shall be allocated to a Member to the extent 
the allocation would cause a negative balance in such Member's Capital 
Account (after taking into account the adjustments, allocations and 
distributions described in Treasury Regulations Sections 1.704-
1(b)(2)(ii)(d)(4), (5) and (6)) that exceeds the amount that such 
Member would be required to reimburse the Company pursuant to this 
Agreement or Applicable Law.
    (d) In the event any Member unexpectedly receives any adjustments, 
allocations, or distributions described in Treasury Regulations 
Sections 1.704-1(b)(2)(ii)(d)(4), (5) and (6), items of the Company's 
income and gain shall be specially allocated to such Member in an 
amount and manner sufficient to eliminate as quickly as possible any 
deficit balance in its Capital Account created by such adjustments, 
allocations or distributions in excess of that permitted under Section 
9.2(c). Any special allocations of items of income or gain pursuant to 
this Section 9.2(d) shall be taken into account in computing subsequent 
allocations pursuant to this Section 9.2 so that the net amount of any 
items so allocated and all other items allocated to each Member 
pursuant to this Section 9.2 shall, to the extent possible, be equal to 
the net

[[Page 5019]]

amount that would have been allocated to each such Member pursuant to 
the provisions of this Section 9.2 if such unexpected adjustments, 
allocations or distributions had not occurred.

Article X.

RECORDS AND ACCOUNTING; REPORTS

Fiscal Year.
    (b) All matters concerning accounting procedures shall be 
determined by the Operating Committee.

Section 10.2 Tax Status; Returns.

    (a) It is the intent of this Company and the Members that this

    (b) The Partnership Representative shall use reasonable efforts to 
inform each Member of all significant matters that may come to its 
attention by giving notice thereof and to forward to each Member copies 
of all significant written communications it may receive in such 
capacity. The Partnership Representative shall consult with the Members 
before taking any material actions with respect to tax matters, 
including actions relating to (i) an IRS examination of the Company 
commenced under Section 6231(a) of the Code, (ii) a request for 
administrative adjustment filed by the Company under Section 6227 of 
the Code, (iii) the filing of a petition for readjustment under Section 
6234 of the Code with respect to a final notice of partnership 
adjustment, (iv) the appeal of an adverse judicial decision, and (v) 
the compromise, settlement, or dismissal of any such proceedings.
    (c) The Partnership Representative shall not compromise or settle 
any tax audit or litigation affecting the Members without the approval 
of a majority of Members. Any material proposed action, inaction, or 
election to be taken by the Partnership Representative, including the 
election under Section 6226(a)(1) of the Code, shall require the prior 
approval of a majority of Members.

the Company shall terminate.

Article XII.

EXCULPATION AND INDEMNIFICATION

Section 12.1 Exculpation.

    Each Member, by and for itself, each of its Affiliates and each of 
its and their respective equity holders, directors, officers, 
controlling persons, partners, employees, successors and assigns, 
hereby acknowledges and agrees that it is the intent of the Company and 
each Member that the liability of each Member and each individual 
currently or formerly serving as an SRO Voting Representative (each, an 
``Exculpated Party'') be limited to the maximum extent permitted by 
Applicable Law or as otherwise expressly provided herein. In accordance 
with the foregoing, the Members hereby acknowledge and agree that:
    (a) To the maximum extent permitted by Applicable Law or as 
otherwise expressly provided herein, no present or former Exculpated 
Party or any of such Exculpated Party's Affiliates, heirs, successors, 
assigns, agents or representatives shall be liable to the Company or 
any Member for any loss suffered in connection with a breach of any 
fiduciary duty, errors in judgment or other acts or omissions by such 
Exculpated Party; provided, however, that this provision shall not 
eliminate or limit the liability of such Exculpated Party for (i) acts 
or omissions which involve gross negligence, willful misconduct or a 
knowing violation of law, or (ii) as provided in Section 5.4(d) hereof, 
losses resulting from such Exculpated Party's Transaction Reports, 
Quotation Information or other information reported to the Processors 
by such Exculpated Party (collectively ``Non-Exculpated Items''). Any 
Exculpated Party may consult with counsel and accountants in respect of

[[Page 5020]]

Company affairs, and provided such Person acts in good faith reliance 
upon the advice or opinion of such counsel or accountants, such Person 
shall not be liable for any loss suffered in reliance thereon.
    (b) Notwithstanding anything to the contrary contained herein, 
whenever in this Agreement or any other agreement contemplated herein 
or otherwise, an Exculpated Party is permitted or required to take any 
action or to make a decision in its ``sole discretion'' or 
``discretion'' or that it deems ``necessary,'' or ``necessary or 
appropriate'' or under a grant of similar authority or latitude, the 
Exculpated Party may, insofar as Applicable Law permits, make such 
decision in its sole discretion (regardless of whether there is a 
reference to ``sole discretion'' or ``discretion''). The Exculpated 
Party (i) shall be entitled to consider such interests and factors as 
it desires (including its own interests), (ii) shall have no duty or 
obligation (fiduciary or otherwise) to give any consideration to any 
interest of or factors affecting the Company or the Members, and (iii) 
shall not be subject to any other or different standards imposed by 
this Agreement, or any other agreement contemplated hereby, under any 
Applicable Law or in equity.

Section 12.2 Right to Indemnification.

    (a) Subject to the limitations and conditions provided in this 
Article XII and to the fullest extent permitted by Applicable Law, the 
Company shall indemnify each Company Indemnified Party for Losses as a 
result of the Company Indemnified Party being a Party to a Proceeding. 
Notwithstanding the foregoing, no such indemnification shall be 
available in the event the Company is a claimant against the Company 
Indemnified Party.
    (b) Indemnification under this Article XII shall continue as to a 
Company Indemnified Party who has ceased to serve in the capacity that 
initially entitled such Company Indemnified Party to indemnity 
hereunder; provided, however, that the Company shall not be obligated 
to indemnify a Company Indemnified Party for the Company Indemnified 
Party's Non-Exculpated Items.
    (c) The rights granted pursuant to this Article XII shall be deemed 
contract rights, and no amendment, modification, or repeal of this 
Article XII shall have the effect of limiting or denying any such 
rights with respect to actions taken or Proceedings arising prior to 
any amendment, modification, or repeal. It is expressly acknowledged 
that the indemnification provided in this Article XII could involve 
indemnification for negligence or under theories of strict liability.
    (d) The Company shall be the primary obligor in respect of any 
Company Indemnified Party's claim for indemnification, for advancement 
of expenses, or for providing insurance, subject to this Article XII. 
The obligation, if any, of any Member or its Affiliates to indemnify, 
to advance expenses to, or provide insurance for any Company 
Indemnified Party shall be secondary to the obligations of the Company

IMPLEMENTATION

Section 14.1 Implementation Timeline.

    The steps to implement the Plan and timelines for completing these 
various steps are set forth in Exhibit F. The timeline shall begin when 
the Plan is approved by the Commission, and such approval is published 
on the Commission's website. The steps to implement the Plan have been 
organized into multiple workstreams, some of which can be performed in 
parallel, and others have dependencies that need to be completed before 
they can begin. In the Exhibit F, the Company has identified such 
dependencies, some of which are outside the control of the Operating 
Committee. In the event a workstream listed in Exhibit F takes shorter 
or, due to factors outside the Operating Committee's reasonable 
control, takes longer than expected, the timelines for contingent steps 
shall be adjusted accordingly to account for such change. Any 
lengthening of the timeline must be made by an affirmative vote of the 
Operating Committee pursuant to Section 4.3(b) and must be based on a 
reasonable determination that the timeline needs to be extended. In 
such instances, the Operating Committee will include the adjustment in 
its written progress report to the Commission in accordance with 
Section 14.2.

[[Page 5022]]

Section 14.2 Written Progress Reports to Commission.

    (a) Beginning three months after the formation of the Operating 
Committee and continuing every three months until the Operative Date, 
the Operating Committee will provide written progress reports to the 
Commission every three months.
    (b) The written progress reports will contain the actions 
undertaken to date by the Operating Committee and a detailed 
description of the progress made toward completing each of the steps 
listed in Exhibit F. The Operating Committee will make such progress 
reports available on the CQ Plan and CTA Plan's and UTP Plan's 
websites, and on the Plan's website, when available after the selection 
of the Administrator.

Section 14.3 Transition From CQ Plan, CTA Plan, and UTP Plan.

    (a) Until the Operative Date, the Members will continue to operate 
pursuant to the CQ Plan, CTA Plan, and UTP Plan with respect to the 
public dissemination of real-time consolidated equity market data for 
Eligible Securities rather than this Agreement.
    (b) As of the Operative Date, the Members shall conduct, through 
the Company, the Processor and Administrator functions related to the 
public dissemination of real-time consolidated equity market data for 
Eligible Securities required by the Commission to be performed by the 
Members under the Exchange Act. The Members shall file an amendment to 
the CQ Plan, CTA Plan, and UTP Plan to cease their operation as of the 
Operative Date.
    IN WITNESS WHEREOF, the undersigned Members have executed this 
Agreement as of the day and year first above written.

Confidentiality Policy

    (a) Purpose and Scope.
    (i) The purpose of this Confidentiality Policy is to provide 
guidance to the Operating Committee, and all subcommittees thereof, 
regarding the confidentiality of any data or information (in physical 
or electronic form) generated by, accessed by, or transmitted to the 
Operating Committee or any subcommittee, as well as discussions 
occurring at a meeting of the Operating Committee or any subcommittee.
    (ii) This Policy applies to all Covered Persons. All Covered 
Persons must adhere to the principles set out in this Policy and all 
Covered Persons that are natural persons may not receive Company data 
and information until they affirm in writing that they have read this 
Policy and undertake to abide by its terms.
    (iii) Covered Persons may not disclose Restricted, Highly 
Confidential, or Confidential information except as consistent with 
this Policy and directed by the Operating Committee.
    (iv) The Administrator and Processors will establish written 
confidential information policies that provide for the protection of 
information under their control and the control of their Agents, 
including policies and procedures that provide systemic controls for 
classifying, declassifying, redacting, aggregating, anonymizing, and 
safeguarding information, that is in addition to, and not less than, 
the protection afforded herein. Such policies will be reviewed and 
approved by the Operating Committee pursuant to Section 4.3, publicly 
posted, and made available to the Operating Committee for review and 
approval every two years thereafter or when changes are made, whichever 
is sooner.
    (v) Information will be classified solely based on its content.

[[Page 5024]]

    (b) Procedures.
    (i) General
    (A) The Administrator and Processors will be the custodians of all 
documents discussed by the Operating Committee and will be responsible 
for maintaining the classification of such documents pursuant to this 
Policy.
    (B) The Administrator may, under delegated authority, designate 
documents as Restricted, Highly Confidential, or Confidential, which 
will be determinative unless altered by an affirmative vote of the 
Operating Committee pursuant to Section 4.3.
    (C) The Administrator will ensure that all Restricted, Highly 
Confidential, or Confidential documents are properly labeled and, if 
applicable, electronically safeguarded.
    (D) All contracts between the Company and its Agents shall require 
Company information to be treated as Confidential Information that may 
not be disclosed to third parties, except as necessary to effect the 
terms of the contract or as required by law, and shall incorporate the 
terms of this Policy, or terms that are substantially equivalent or 
more restrictive, into the contract.
    (ii) Procedures Concerning Restricted Information
    (A) Disclosure of Restricted Information
    (1) Except as provided below, Covered Persons in possession of 
Restricted Information are prohibited from disclosing it to others.
    (2) Covered Persons in possession of Restricted Information are 
prohibited from disclosing it to others, including Agents, except where 
authorized to do so by the Operating Committee. Any authorization to 
disclose Restricted Information must identify the Covered Persons or 
third party authorized to receive the Restricted Information, and such 
disclosure must be in furtherance of the interests of the plan. Any 
authorization must be granted on a case-by-case basis, unless the 
Operating Committee grants standing approval to allow disclosure of 
specified recurring information to identified Covered Persons. Any 
Covered Person or third party receiving or having access to Restricted 
Information pursuant to this subparagraph must segregate such 
information, retain it in confidence, and use it only in a manner 
consistent with the terms of this Policy.
    (3) Covered Persons may disclose Restricted Information to the 
staff of the SEC or as otherwise required by Applicable Law, or to 
other Covered Persons as expressly provided for by this Policy.
    (B) If the Administrator determines that it is appropriate to share 
a customer's financial information with the Operating Committee or a 
subcommittee thereof, the Administrator will first anonymize the 
information by redacting the customer's name and any other information 
that may lead to the identification of the customer.
    (C) The Administrator may disclose the identity of a customer that 
is the subject of Restricted Information in Executive Session only if 
the Administrator determines in good faith that it is necessary to 
disclose the customer's identity in order to obtain input or feedback 
from the Operating Committee or a subcommittee thereof about a matter 
of importance to the Company. In such an event, the Administrator will 
change the designation of the information at issue from ``Restricted 
Information'' to ``Highly Confidential Information,'' and its use will 
be governed by the procedures for Highly Confidential Information in 
subparagraph (iii) below.
    (iii) Procedures Concerning Highly Confidential Information
    (A) Disclosure of Highly Confidential Information:
    (1) Highly Confidential Information may be disclosed in Executive 
Session of the Operating Committee or to the subcommittee established 
pursuant to Section 4.7(c). Covered Persons in possession of Highly 
Confidential Information are prohibited from disclosing it to others, 
including Agents, except as provided below. This prohibition does not 
apply to disclosures to the staff of the SEC or as otherwise required 
by law (such as those required to receive the information to ensure the 
Member complies with its regulatory obligations).
    (2) An SRO Voting Representative may disclose certain Highly 
Confidential Information to officers or employees of a Member who have 
direct or supervisory responsibility for the Member's participation in 
the Plan, or with agents for the Member supporting the Member's 
participation in the Plan, provided that such information may not be 
used in the procurement for, or development, modeling, pricing, 
licensing, or sale of, PDP. The types of Highly Confidential 
Information permitted to be shared under this subparagraph shall 
consist of (i) the Plan's contract negotiations with the Processor(s) 
or Administrator; (ii) communications with, and work product of, 
counsel to the Plan; and (iii) information concerning personnel matters 
that affect the employees of the Member or of the Plan. Any Covered 
Person receiving or having access to Restricted Information pursuant to 
this subparagraph must segregate such information, retain it in 
confidence, and use it only in a manner consistent with the terms of 
this Policy. Any SRO Voting Representative who discloses Highly 
Confidential Information pursuant to this subparagraph shall maintain a 
log documenting each instance of such disclosure, including the 
information shared, the persons receiving the information, and the date 
the information was shared.
    (3) Highly Confidential Information may be disclosed to the staff 
of the SEC, unless it is protected by the Attorney-Client Privilege or 
the Work Product Doctrine. Any disclosure of Highly Confidential 
Information to the staff of the SEC will be accompanied by a FOIA 
Confidential Treatment request.
    (4) Highly Confidential Information may be disclosed, as required 
by Applicable Law.
    (5) The Operating Committee may authorize the disclosure of 
specified Highly Confidential Information to identified third parties 
that are acting as Agents. Any authorization must be granted on a case-
by-case basis, unless the Operating Committee grants standing approval 
to allow disclosure of specified recurring information to identified 
Covered Persons. Any Covered Person or third party receiving or having 
access to Highly Confidential Information pursuant to this subparagraph 
must segregate such information, retain it in confidence, and use it 
only in a manner consistent with the terms of this Policy.
    (5) Apart from the foregoing, the Operating Committee has no power 
to authorize any other disclosure of Highly Confidential Information.
    (B) In the event that a Covered Person is determined by an 
affirmative vote of the Operating Committee pursuant to this Policy to 
have disclosed Highly Confidential Information, the Operating Committee 
will determine the appropriate remedy for the breach based on the facts 
and circumstances of the event. For an SRO Voting Representative or 
Member Observer, remedies include a letter of complaint submitted to 
the SEC, which may be made public by the Operating Committee. For a 
member of the Advisory Committee, remedies include removal of that 
member of the Advisory Committee.
    (iv) Procedures Concerning Confidential Information
    (A) Confidential Information may be disclosed during a meeting of 
the Operating Committee or any subcommittee thereof. Additionally, a 
Covered Person may disclose

[[Page 5025]]

Confidential Information to other persons who need to receive such 
information to fulfill their responsibilities to the Plan, including 
oversight of the Plan. The recipient must segregate the information, 
retain it in confidence, and use it only in a manner consistent with 
the terms of this policy. A Covered Person also may disclose 
Confidential Information to the staff of the SEC, as authorized by the 
Operating Committee as described below, or as may be otherwise required 
by law.
    (B) The Operating Committee may authorize the disclosure of 
Confidential Information by an affirmative vote of the Operating 
Committee pursuant to Section 4.3. Any authorization must be granted on 
a case-by-case basis, unless the Operating Committee grants standing 
approval to allow disclosure of specified recurring information to 
identified Covered Persons. Any Covered Person or third party receiving 
or having access to Confidential Information pursuant to this 
subparagraph must segregate such information, retain it in confidence, 
and use it only in a manner consistent with the terms of this Policy. 
Notwithstanding the foregoing, the Operating Committee will not 
authorize the disclosure of Confidential Information that is generated 
by a Member or member of the Advisory Committee and designated by such 
Member or member of the Advisory Committee as Confidential, unless such 
Member or member of the Advisory Committee consents to the disclosure.
    (C) Members of the Advisory Committee may be authorized by the 
Operating Committee to disclose particular Confidential Information 
only in furtherance of the interests of the Company, to enable them to 
consult with industry representatives or technical experts, provided 
that the members of the Advisory Committee take any steps requested by 
the Operating Committee to prevent further dissemination of that 
Confidential Information, including providing the individual(s) 
consulted with a copy of this Policy and requesting that person to 
maintain the confidentiality of such information in a manner consistent 
with this policy.
    (D) A Covered Person that is a representative of a Member may be 
authorized by the Operating Committee to disclose particular 
Confidential Information to other employees or agents of the Member or 
its affiliates only in furtherance of the interests of the Company as 
needed for such Covered Person to perform his or her function on behalf 
of the Company. A copy of this Policy will be made available to 
recipients of such information who are employees or agents of a Member 
or its affiliates that are not Covered Persons, who will be required to 
abide by this Confidentiality Policy.
    (E) A Covered Person may disclose their own individual views and 
statements that may otherwise be considered Confidential Information 
without obtaining authorization of the Operating Committee, provided 
that in so disclosing, the Covered Person is not disclosing the views 
or statements of any other Covered Person or Member that are considered 
Confidential Information.
    (F) A person that has reason to believe that Confidential 
Information has been disclosed by another without the authorization of 
the Operating Committee or otherwise in a manner inconsistent with this 
Policy may report such potential unauthorized disclosure to the Chair 
of the Operating Committee. In addition, a Covered Person that 
discloses Confidential Information without the authorization of the 
Operating Committee will report such disclosure to the Chair of the 
Operating Committee. Such self-reported unauthorized disclosure of 
Confidential Information will be recorded in the minutes of the meeting 
of the Operating Committee and will contain: (a) the name(s) of the 
person(s) who disclosed such Confidential Information, and (b) a 
description of the Confidential Information disclosed. The name(s) of 
the person(s) who disclosed such Confidential Information will also be 
recorded in any publicly available summaries of Operating Committee 
minutes.

EXHIBIT D

Distributions

Cost Allocation and Revenue Sharing

    (a) Payments. In accordance with Paragraph (l) of this Exhibit D, 
each Member will receive an annual payment (if any) for each calendar 
year that is equal to the sum of the Member's Trading Shares and 
Quoting Shares (each as defined below), in each Eligible Security for 
such calendar year. In the event that total Net Distributable Operating 
Income (as defined below) is negative for a given calendar year, each 
Member will receive an annual bill for such calendar year to be 
determined according to the same formula (described in this paragraph) 
for determining annual payments to the Members. Unless otherwise stated 
in this agreement, a year shall run from January 1st to December 31st 
and quarters shall end on March 31st, June 30th, September 30th, and 
December 31st. The Company shall cause the Administrator to provide the 
Members with written estimates of each Member's percentage of total 
volume within five business days of the end of each calendar month.
    (b) Security Income Allocation. The ``Security Income Allocation'' 
for an Eligible Security shall be determined by multiplying (i) the Net 
Distributable Operating Income under this Agreement for the calendar 
year by (ii) the Volume Percentage for such Eligible Security (the 
``Initial Allocation''), and then adding or subtracting any amounts 
specified in the reallocation set forth below.
    (c) Volume Percentage. The ``Volume Percentage'' for an Eligible 
Security shall be determined by dividing (A) the square root of the 
dollar volume of Transaction Reports disseminated by the Processors in 
such Eligible Security during the calendar year by (B) the sum of the 
square roots of the dollar volume of Transaction Reports disseminated 
by the Processors in each Eligible Security during the calendar year.
    (d) Cap on Net Distributable Operating Income. If the Initial 
Allocation of Net Distributable Operating Income in accordance with the 
Volume Percentage of an Eligible Security equals an amount greater than 
$4.00 multiplied by the total number of qualified Transaction Reports 
in such Eligible Security during the calendar year, the excess amount 
shall be subtracted from the Initial Allocation for such Eligible 
Security and reallocated among all Eligible Securities in direct 
proportion to the dollar volume of Transaction Reports disseminated by 
the Processors in Eligible Securities during the calendar year. A 
Transaction Report with a dollar volume of $5,000 or more shall 
constitute one qualified Transaction Report. A Transaction Report with 
a dollar volume of less than $5,000 shall constitute a fraction of a 
qualified Transaction Report that equals the dollar volume of the 
Transaction Report divided by $5,000.
    (e) Trading Share. The ``Trading Share'' of a Member in an Eligible 
Security shall be determined by multiplying (i) an amount equal to 
fifty percent of the Security Income Allocation for the Eligible 
Security by (ii) the Member's Trade Rating in the Eligible Security.
    (f) Trade Rating. A Member's ``Trade Rating'' in an Eligible 
Security shall be determined by taking the average of (A) the Member's 
percentage of the total dollar volume of Transaction Reports 
disseminated by the Processors in the

[[Page 5026]]

Eligible Security during the calendar year, and (B) the Member's 
percentage of the total number of qualified Transaction Reports 
disseminated by the Processors in the Eligible Security during the 
calendar year.
    (g) Quoting Share. The ``Quoting Share'' of a Member in an Eligible 
Security shall be determined by multiplying (A) an amount equal to 
fifty percent of the Security Income Allocation for the Eligible 
Security by (B) the Member's Quote Rating in the Eligible Security.
    (h) Quote Rating. A Member's ``Quote Rating'' in an Eligible 
Security shall be determined by dividing (A) the sum of the Quote 
Credits earned by the Member in such Eligible Security during the 
calendar year by (B) the sum of the Quote Credits earned by all Members 
in such Eligible Security during the calendar year.
    (i) Quote Credits. A Member shall earn one ``Quote Credit'' for 
each second of time (with a minimum of one full second) multiplied by 
dollar value of size that an automated best bid (offer) transmitted by 
the Member to the Processors during regular trading hours is equal to 
the price of the National Best Bid and Offer in the Eligible Security 
and does not lock or cross a previously displayed ``automated 
quotation'' (as defined under Rule 600 of Regulation NMS). The dollar 
value of size of a quote shall be determined by multiplying the price 
of a quote by its size.
    (j) Net Distributable Operating Income. The ``Net Distributable 
Operating Income'' for any particular calendar year shall mean:
    (i) all cash revenues, funds and proceeds received by the Company 
during such calendar year (other than Capital Contributions by the 
Members or amounts paid pursuant to Section 3.7(b) of this Agreement), 
including all revenues from (A) the CT Feeds, which includes the 
dissemination of information with respect to Eligible Securities to 
foreign marketplaces, and (B) FINRA quotation data and last sale 
information for securities classified as OTC Equity Securities under 
FINRA's Rule 6400 Series (the ``FINRA OTC Data'') ((A) and (B) 
collectively, the ``Data Feeds''), and (C) any Membership Fees; less
    (ii) 6.25% of the revenue received by the Company during such 
calendar year attributable to the segment of the Data Feeds reflecting 
the dissemination of information with respect to Network C Securities 
and FINRA OTC Data (but, for the avoidance of doubt, not including 
revenue attributable to the segment of the Data Feeds reflecting the 
dissemination of information with respect to Network A Securities and 
Network B Securities), which amount shall be paid to FINRA as 
compensation for the FINRA OTC Data; \1\ less
---------------------------------------------------------------------------

    \1\ All costs associated with collecting, consolidating, 
validating, generating, and disseminating the FINRA OTC Data are 
borne directly by FINRA and not the Company and the Members.
---------------------------------------------------------------------------

    (iii) reasonable working capital reserves and reasonable reserves 
for contingencies for such calendar year, as determined by the 
Operating Committee, and all costs and expenses of the Company during 
such calendar year, including:
    (A) all amounts payable during such calendar year to the 
Administrator pursuant to the Administrative Services Agreement or this 
Agreement;
    (B) all amounts payable during such calendar year to the Processors 
pursuant to the Processor Services Agreements or this Agreement; and
    (C) all amounts payable during such calendar year to third-party 
service providers engaged by or on behalf of the Company.
    (k) Initial Eligibility. At the time a Member implements a 
Processor-approved electronic interface with the Processors, the Member 
will become eligible to receive revenue.
    (l) Quarterly Distributions. The Company shall cause the 
Administrator to provide Members with written estimates of each 
Member's quarterly Net Distributable Operating Income within 45 
calendar days of the end of the quarter, and estimated quarterly 
payments or billings shall be made on the basis of such estimates. All 
quarterly payments or billings shall be made to each eligible Member 
within 45 days following the end of each calendar quarter in which the 
Member is eligible to receive revenue; provided, that each quarterly 
payment or billing shall be reconciled against a Member's cumulative 
year-to-date payment or billing received to date and adjusted 
accordingly; further, provided, that the total of such estimated 
payments or billings shall be reconciled at the end of each calendar 
year and, if necessary, adjusted by March 31st of the following year. 
Interest shall be included in quarterly payments and in adjusted 
payments made on March 31st of the following year. Such interest shall 
accrue monthly during the period in which revenue was earned and not 
yet paid and will be based on the 90-day Treasury bill rate in effect 
at the end of the quarter in which the payment is made. Monthly 
interest shall start accruing 45 days following the month in which it 
is earned and accrue until the date on which the payment is made.
    (m) Itemized Statements. In conjunction with calculating estimated 
quarterly and reconciled annual payments under this Exhibit D, the 
Company shall cause the Administrator to submit to the Members a 
quarterly itemized statement setting forth the basis upon which Net 
Distributable Operating Income was calculated. Such Net Distributable 
Operating Income shall be adjusted annually based solely on the 
quarterly itemized statement audited pursuant to the annual audit. The 
Company shall cause the Administrator to pay or bill Members for the 
audit adjustments within thirty days of completion of the annual audit. 
Upon the affirmative vote of Voting Representatives pursuant to Section 
4.3, the Company shall cause the Administrator to engage an independent 
auditor to audit the Administrator's costs or other calculation(s).
