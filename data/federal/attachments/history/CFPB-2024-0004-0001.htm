SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION: 
    Title of Collection: Auto Finance Data Project.
    OMB Control Number: 3170-00XX.
    Type of Review: New information collection.
    Affected Public: Auto finance companies.
    Estimated Number of Respondents: 4,000.
    Estimated Total Annual Burden Hours: 1,375.
    Abstract: The Dodd-Frank Wall Street Reform and Consumer Protection 
Act charges the CFPB with monitoring for risks to consumers in the 
offering or provision of consumer financial products or services, 
including developments in markets for such products or services. The 
CFPB has previously researched and documented significant gaps in 
available auto finance data which culminated in the initial Auto 
Finance Data Pilot project launched in February 2023. The data 
collected as part of the Auto Finance Data Pilot project both confirmed 
the benefit of additional data collection to fully carry out the CFPB's 
mission, to fulfill the CFPB's mandate to monitor the auto finance 
market for risks to consumers, and to inform the way the CFPB would 
propose to collect data in the future. The CFPB proposes to collect 
data in two separate processes.
    The CFPB proposes to collect a set of data annually from lenders 
that originate greater than 20,000 auto loans in the previous calendar 
year. This data collection would mirror that which was collected in the 
Auto Finance Data Pilot. The CFPB also proposes to collect a set of 
data annually from lenders that originate greater than 500 loans and 
fewer than 20,000 loans in the previous calendar year. This data 
collection would annually collect information on the number of vehicles 
repossessed and the number of loan modifications.
    Request for Comments: Comments are invited on: (a) Whether the 
collection of information is necessary for the proper performance of 
the functions of the CFPB, including whether the information will have 
practical utility; (b) The accuracy of the CFPB's estimate of the 
burden of the collection of information, including the validity of the 
methods and the assumptions used; (c) Ways to enhance the quality, 
utility, and clarity of the information to be collected; and (d) Ways 
to minimize the burden of the collection of information on respondents, 
including through the use of automated collection techniques or other 
forms of information technology. Comments submitted in response to this 
notice will be summarized and/or included in the request for OMB's 
approval. All comments will become a matter of public record.

Anthony May,
Paperwork Reduction Act Officer, Consumer Financial Protection Bureau.
