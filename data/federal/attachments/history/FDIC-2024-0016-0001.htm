    General Description of Collection: Section 32 of the FDIA (12 
U.S.C. 1831i) requires an insured depository institution or depository 
institution holding company under certain circumstances to notify the 
appropriate federal banking agency of the proposed addition of any 
individual to the board of directors or the employment of any 
individual as a senior executive officer of such institution at least 
30 days before such addition or employment becomes effective. Section 
32 of the FDIA also provides that the FDIC may disapprove an 
individual's service as a director or senior executive officer of 
certain state nonmember banks or state savings associations if, upon 
assessing

[[Page 17468]]

the individual's competence, experience, character, and integrity, it 
is determined that the individual's service would not be in the best 
interest of the depositors of the institution or the public. The 
Interagency Notice of Change in Director or Senior Executive Officer, 
with the information contained in the Interagency Biographical and 
Financial Report (described above) as an attachment, is used by the 
FDIC to collect information relevant to assess the individual's 
competence, experience, character, and integrity. There is no change in 
the methodology or substance of this information collection. The 
reduction in estimated annual burden (from 214 hours in 2021 to 124 
hours currently) is due to the decrease in the estimated number of 
annual responses.

    General Description of Collection: The Prompt Corrective Action 
(PCA) provisions of section 38 of the Federal Deposit Insurance Act 
requires or permits the FDIC and other federal banking agencies to take 
certain supervisory actions when FDIC-insured institutions fall within 
certain capital categories. They also restrict or prohibit certain 
activities and require the submission of a capital restoration plan 
when an insured institution becomes undercapitalized. Various 
provisions of the statute and the FDIC's implementing regulations 
require the prior approval of the FDIC before an FDIC-supervised 
institution, or certain insured depository institutions, can engage in 
certain activities, or allow the FDIC to make exceptions to 
restrictions that would otherwise be imposed. This collection of 
information consists of the applications that are required to obtain 
the FDIC's prior approval to engage in these activities. There is no 
change in the methodology or substance of this information collection. 
The estimated burden remains unchanged from 2021.

Request for Comment

    Comments are invited on: (a) Whether the collections of information 
are necessary for the proper performance of the FDIC's functions, 
including whether the information has practical utility; (b) the 
accuracy of the estimates of the burden of the information collections, 
including the validity of the methodology and assumptions used; (c) 
ways to enhance the quality, utility, and clarity of the information to 
be collected; and (d) ways to minimize the burden of the collections of 
information on respondents, including through the use of automated 
collection techniques or other forms of information technology. All 
comments will become a matter of public record.

    Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation.

Assistant Executive Secretary.
