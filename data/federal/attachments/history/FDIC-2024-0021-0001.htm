    General Description of Collection: This collection consists of 
recordkeeping requirements for qualified financial contracts (QFCs) 
held by insured depository institutions in troubled condition. There is 
no change in the methodology or substance of this information 
collection. The decrease in the estimated annual burden (from 10,250 
hours in 2021 to 8,960 hours currently) is due to the decline in the 
estimated number of limited scope entities covered by Part 371.

Request for Comment

    Comments are invited on: (a) Whether the collections of information 
are necessary for the proper performance of the FDIC's functions, 
including whether the information has practical utility; (b) the 
accuracy of the estimates of the burden of the information collections, 
including the validity of the methodology and assumptions used; (c) 
ways to enhance the quality, utility, and clarity of the information to 
be collected; and (d) ways to minimize the burden of the collections of 
information on respondents, including through the use of automated 
collection techniques or other forms of information technology. All 
comments will become a matter of public record.

Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation.

    Dated at Washington, DC, on March 20, 2024.
