Source: FDIC.
Note: The estimated annual IC time burden is the product, rounded to the nearest hour, of the estimated annual
  number of responses and the estimated time per response for a given IC. The estimated annual number of
  responses is the product, rounded to the nearest whole number, of the estimated annual number of respondents
  and the estimated annual number of responses per respondent. This methodology ensures the estimated annual
  burdens in the table are consistent with the values recorded in OMB's consolidated information system.

    General Description of Collection: The FDIC proposes to use the 
Visitor Notification form to collect biographical, passport (for 
foreign nationals), and employment information from certain \1\ 
visitors to the FDIC in order to assess the risk to FDIC facilities and 
personnel. The FDIC will require certain visitors to FDIC facilities, 
including support staff and interpreters, to complete and submit the 
form. Interested members of the public may obtain a copy of the 
proposed Visitor Notification form at the following web page: <a href="https://www.fdic.gov/resources/regulations/federal-register-publications/2024/visitor-notification-form.pdf">https://www.fdic.gov/resources/regulations/federal-register-publications/2024/visitor-notification-form.pdf</a>.
