II. Clearing Agency's Statement of the Purpose of, and Statutory Basis 
for, the Proposed Rule Change

    In its filing with the Commission, the clearing agency included 
statements concerning the purpose of and basis for the proposed rule 
change and discussed any comments it received on the proposed rule 
change. The text of these statements may be examined at the places 
specified in Item IV below. The clearing agency has prepared summaries, 
set forth in sections A, B, and C below, of the most significant 
aspects of such statements.

(A) Clearing Agency's Statement of the Purpose of, and Statutory Basis 
for, the Proposed Rule Change

Purpose
    The proposed rule change would modify the Fee Guide to revise 
certain fees charged to Participants for (i) Participants Fund 
Maintenance; (ii) Underwriting Services; (iii) Asset Services; and (iv) 
Settlement Services, as described below.
Overview
    DTC operates a ``low cost'' pricing model and has in place 
procedures to control costs and to regularly review pricing levels 
against costs of operation. It reviews pricing levels against its costs 
of operation during the annual budget process. The budget is approved 
annually by the Board. DTC's fees are cost-based plus a low-margin 
markup, as approved by the Board or management (pursuant to authority 
delegated by the Board), as applicable. The markup is applied to 
recover development costs and operating expenses, and to accumulate 
capital sufficient to meet regulatory and economic requirements. When 
estimating expected revenues and costs, DTC typically uses historical, 
current, and expected usage and market trends to determine revenue 
outlook and apply current budgeted assumptions on costs.
    In addition to assessing the overall impact of fee changes at DTC, 
the Board also considers impacts of fee changes from an individual 
product/service category (e.g., Underwriting, Asset Services, 
Participants Fund Maintenance) perspective, taking cost and capital 
considerations relating to a given category into account. After 
evaluation of DTC's short-term and long-term financial position in 
consideration of expected Participant activity, revenues, cost of 
funding, market volatility, and the financial markets more broadly, DTC 
has determined that it should increase the overall amount it collects 
from Participants through fees. In this regard, the proposed rule 
change would increase certain fees relating to Participants Fund 
maintenance and Underwriting Services, and it would eliminate and 
consolidate other Asset Services fees included in the Fee Guide, to 
better align cost and revenue, as described below.
Participant Fund Maintenance Fee Increase
    DTC maintains a pool of funds used for liquidity purposes 
consisting of mandatory and voluntary contributions by Participants 
(``Participants Fund''). The Participants Fund creates liquidity and 
collateral resources to support the business of DTC and to cover losses 
and liabilities incident to that business. For this purpose, every 
Participant has a Required Participants Fund Deposit based on the 
Participant's activity at DTC. The Participants Fund is held in cash at 
DTC and is used in the event a Participant fails to settle.
    In support of maintaining the Participants Fund, DTC charges a 
Participants Fund Maintenance Fee, which is a monthly fee calculated, 
in arrears, as the product of (A) 0.25 percent and (B) the average of 
each Participant's Actual Participants Fund Deposit, as of the end of 
each day, for the month, multiplied by the number of days for that 
month and divided by 360.\8\ DTC proposes to increase the rate used to 
calculate the Participants Fund Maintenance Fee by 10 basis points from 
0.25 percent to 0.35 percent. DTC is proposing this increase in order 
to cover its costs for servicing the fund and to maintain the 
appropriate low-margin markup above costs.
---------------------------------------------------------------------------

    \8\ See Fee Guide, supra note 6 at 20.
---------------------------------------------------------------------------

    All 193 Participants are projected to incur a 40 percent increase 
to their

[[Page 976]]

individual Participants Fund Maintenance Fee as a result of the 
increase. Of these Participants, six would see an increase between 
$100,000 and $130,000; 27 would see an increase between $10,000 and 
$100,000; and 160 would see an increase of less than $10,000.
Underwriting Fee Increase
    DTC, through its Underwriting Department, serves the financial 
industry by making securities eligible for depository services. Through 
DTC, Participants have the ability to distribute new and secondary 
offerings quickly and economically by electronic book-entry delivery 
and settlement. These securities are then available for depository 
services.
    Due to decreasing issuance volumes since 2021, strategic 
investments in modernization, and continued inflationary headwinds, 
DTC's Underwriting fees, which have not changed in 10 years, are not 
covering its costs. DTC proposes to amend the Fee Guide to increase the 
Underwriting eligibility fees charged to Participants to better align 
costs and revenue.
    Specifically, DTC proposes to increase eligibility fees by 
approximately 20 percent across the following Underwriting fees (bold, 
underlined text indicates additions and bold, strikethrough text 
indicates deletions):
[GRAPHIC] [TIFF OMITTED] TN08JA24.000

    Sixty-five Participants would see an increase in Underwriting fees. 
Of these Participants, 14 would see an increase between $100,000 and 
$800,000; 26 would see an increase between $10,000 and $100,000; and 25 
would see an increase of less than $10,000.
Asset Services--Simplification and Consolidation of Fees
    Asset Services is comprised of diverse asset events outside of 
clearance and settlement. It encompasses over 1.3 million DTC-eligible 
equity and debt securities, and provides efficient and effective 
centralization, simplification, and automation in the handling of 
physical securities. It also processes principal, income, and corporate 
actions for these instruments.
    DTC conducted an extensive review of the current DTC Fee Schedule 
to ensure alignment with current practice and to streamline DTC's fee 
structure for a better client experience. The proposed changes to both 
eliminate and consolidate several Asset Services fees would improve 
customer billing transparency and provide clearer guidance on when fees 
are applied. The proposed changes also further reduce the complexity of 
tiered fee structures and eliminate fees for outdated and non-value-add 
services. These changes will not have a material impact on the total 
dollar amount of Asset Services fees charged to Participants.
    Specifically, the following entries in the Asset Services section 
of the Fee Guide would be revised (bold, underlined text indicates 
additions and bold, strikethrough text indicates deletions):

Guide would be revised (bold, underlined text indicates additions and 
bold strikethrough text indicates deletions):

Participant Outreach
    DTC has conducted ongoing outreach to each Participant in order to 
provide them with notice of the proposed changes and the anticipated 
impact for the Participant. The impact of the proposed changes was 
provided to Participants using year to date July 2023 annualized data. 
Participants asked clarifying questions but did not express concerns.
Implementation Timeframe
    DTC would implement this proposal on January 1, 2024. To that 
effect, a legend would be added to the Fee Guide stating there are 
changes that have become effective upon filing with the but have not 
yet been implemented. The

[[Page 980]]

proposed legend also would include a date on which such changes would 
be implemented and the file number of this proposal, and state that, 
once this proposal is implemented, the legend would automatically be 
removed from the Fee Guide.
2. Statutory Basis
    DTC believes this proposal is consistent with the requirements of 
the Act and the rules and regulations thereunder applicable to a 
registered clearing agency. Specifically, DTC believes the proposed 
changes to modify fees charged to Participants for (i) Participants 
Fund Maintenance; (ii) Underwriting Services; (iii) Asset Services; and 
(iv) Settlement Services, as described above, are consistent with 
Section 17A(b)(3)(D) of the Act,\9\ for the reasons described below. 
DTC also believes that the proposed changes to update the Fee Guide 
with the new fees are consistent with Rule 17Ad-22(e)(23)(ii),\10\ as 
promulgated under the Act, for the reasons described below.
---------------------------------------------------------------------------

    \9\ 15 U.S.C. 78q-1(b)(3)(D).
    \10\ 17 CFR.17Ad-22(e)(23)(ii).
---------------------------------------------------------------------------

    Section 17A(b)(3)(D) of the Act requires, inter alia, that the 
Rules provide for the equitable allocation of reasonable dues, fees, 
and other charges among Participants.\11\ DTC believes the proposed 
rule change to revise fees charged to Participants for (i) Participants 
Fund Maintenance; (ii) Underwriting Services; (iii) Asset Services; and 
(iv) Settlement Services, would provide for the equitable allocation of 
reasonable fees. Because all 193 Participants would see an increase in 
fees, and those increases are equally shared (e.g., in the case of the 
Participants Fund Maintenance with a consistent 40 percent increase per 
Participant) and directly proportional to the Participants' use of 
DTC's services (e.g., in the case of the Underwriting and Asset Service 
fees), DTC believes the fees continue to be equitably allocated.
---------------------------------------------------------------------------

    \11\ 15 U.S.C. 78q-1(b)(3)(D).
---------------------------------------------------------------------------

    DTC also believes that the proposed fees would continue to be 
reasonable under the described changes. As described above, DTC's fees 
are cost-based plus a low-margin markup. As such the proposed fee 
changes are simply designed to better align to the projected operating 
costs and expenses of DTC relating to its services. For this reason, 
DTC believes that the proposed fee changes, as described above, are 
reasonable and consistent with Section 17A(b)(3)(D) of the Act.\12\
---------------------------------------------------------------------------

    \12\ Id.
---------------------------------------------------------------------------

    Rule 17Ad-22(e)(23)(ii) under the Act \13\ requires DTC to 
establish, implement, maintain, and enforce written policies and 
procedures reasonably designed to provide sufficient information to 
enable participants to identify and evaluate the risks, fees, and other 
material costs they incur by participating in the covered clearing 
agency. The proposed fees would be clearly and transparently published 
in the Fee Guide, which is available on a public website,\14\ thereby 
enabling Participants to identify the fees and costs associated with 
participating in DTC. As such, DTC believes the proposed rule change is 
consistent with Rule 17Ad-22(e)(23)(ii) under the Act.\15\
---------------------------------------------------------------------------

    \13\ 17 CFR 240.17Ad-22(e)(23)(ii).
    \14\ See supra note 6.
    \15\ 17 CFR 240.17Ad-22(e)(23)(ii).
---------------------------------------------------------------------------

(B) Clearing Agency's Statement on Burden on Competition

    The proposed rule change may impact competition and that impact may 
be a burden because it would result in increased fees paid by 
Participants, as described above. However, DTC does not believe such a 
burden would be significant because the fees would be charged equally 
to all Participants that utilize DTC's services and would merely 
reflect the Participants' activity at DTC. Regardless, DTC believes any 
burden would be necessary and appropriate in furtherance of the 
purposes of the Act, as permitted by Section 17A(b)(3)(I) of the 
Act.\16\
---------------------------------------------------------------------------

    \16\ 15 U.S.C. 78q-1(b)(3)(I).
---------------------------------------------------------------------------

    DTC believes any such burden would be necessary because the 
proposed fee increases would better align the fees with DTC's 
associated costs, helping DTC to achieve and maintain its net income 
margin. Meanwhile, DTC also believes that any such burden would be 
appropriate because the fees would continue to be equitably and 
reasonably allocated among all Participants, as described above.

(C) Clearing Agency's Statement on Comments on the Proposed Rule Change 
Received From Members, Participants, or Others

this proposal. If any written comments are received, they would be
