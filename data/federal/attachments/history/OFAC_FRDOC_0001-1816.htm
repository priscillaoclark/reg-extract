DEPARTMENT OF THE TREASURY

Office of Foreign Assets Control

31 CFR Part 510


North Korea Sanctions Regulations

AGENCY: Office of Foreign Assets Control, Treasury.

ACTION: Final rule.

-----------------------------------------------------------------------

SUMMARY: The Department of the Treasury's Office of Foreign Assets 
Control (OFAC) is amending the North Korea Sanctions Regulations to 
modify a general license that authorizes certain transactions in 
support of specified humanitarian activities of nongovernmental 
organizations. Additionally, OFAC is adding general licenses to 
authorize the following: transactions related to the exportation and 
reexportation of items authorized by the U.S. Department of Commerce; 
the provision of certain agricultural commodities, medicine, and 
medical devices; and certain journalistic activities in North Korea.

DATES: This rule is effective February 16, 2024.

FOR FURTHER INFORMATION CONTACT: OFAC: Assistant Director for 
Licensing, tel.: 202-622-2480; Assistant Director for Regulatory 
Affairs, tel.: 202-622-4855; or Assistant Director for Compliance, 
tel.: 202-622-2490.

SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION:

Electronic Availability

    This document and additional information concerning OFAC are 
available on OFAC's website: <a href="http://www.treas.gov/ofac">www.treas.gov/ofac</a>.

Background

    On November 4, 2010, OFAC issued the North Korea Sanctions 
Regulations, 31 CFR part 510 (75 FR 67912, November 4, 2010) (the 
``Regulations''). Since then, OFAC has amended the Regulations several 
times. OFAC is now amending the general license at Sec.  510.512 of the 
Regulations, which authorizes certain transactions in support of 
specified humanitarian activities of nongovernmental organizations 
(NGOs) in North Korea, to broaden the activities and transactions 
authorized, including transactions with certain Government of North 
Korea entities that are necessary for the provision of services 
authorized by Sec.  510.512, and make other changes. As a condition of 
the general license, NGOs relying on the authorization must submit a 
report to the U.S. Department of State no fewer than 30 days before the 
commencement of their activity indicating that the NGO's activities 
have been approved by or notified to the Security Council Committee 
established pursuant to United Nations Security Council resolution 1718 
(2006), or that the NGO's activities do not require such an approval or 
notification. The U.S. Department of State may notify NGOs within the 
two-week period following submission of the report to inform them that 
their activities are not authorized by the NGO general license.
    Additionally, this rule adds three new general licenses to the 
Regulations. Section 510.520 authorizes transactions incident to the 
exportation or reexportation to North Korea of items (commodities, 
software, or technology) subject to the Export Administration 
Regulations, 15 CFR parts 730 through 774 (EAR), that have been 
licensed or otherwise authorized by the U.S. Department of Commerce 
under the EAR, including on a ``No License Required'' (NLR) basis due 
to the availability of an EAR license exception. Section 510.521 
authorizes the provision of certain agricultural commodities, medicine, 
and medical devices (excluding ``luxury goods'' as described in 15 CFR 
746.4(b)(1)) that are not subject to the EAR to North Korea. Section 
510.522 authorizes U.S. news reporting organizations and their 
employees to engage in certain journalistic activities in North Korea, 
which OFAC authorizes via specific license. Finally, this rule corrects 
a typographic error in the authority citation.

Public Participation

    Because this amendment of the Regulations involves a foreign 
affairs function, the provisions of Executive Order 12866 of September 
30, 1993, ``Regulatory Planning and Review'' (58 FR 51735, October 4, 
1993), as amended, and the Administrative Procedure Act (5 U.S.C. 553) 
requiring notice of proposed rulemaking, opportunity for public 
participation, and delay in effective date are inapplicable. Because no 
notice of proposed rulemaking is required for this rule, the Regulatory 
Flexibility Act (5 U.S.C. 601-612) does not apply.

Paperwork Reduction Act

    The collections of information related to the Regulations are 
contained in 31 CFR part 501 (the ``Reporting, Procedures and Penalties 
Regulations''). Pursuant to the Paperwork Reduction Act of 1995 (44 
U.S.C. 3507), those collections of information have been approved by 
the Office of Management and Budget under control number 1505-0164. An 
agency may not conduct or sponsor, and a person is not required to 
respond to, a collection of information unless the collection of 
information displays a valid control number.

authorized to process transfers of funds on behalf of U.S. or third-
country NGOs, including transfers of funds to or from North Korea, in 
support of the activities authorized by paragraph (a) of this section.
    (d) This section does not authorize the following transactions:

to an activity authorized in paragraph (a) of this section;
    (2) Partnerships or partnership agreements with any military, 
intelligence, or law enforcement entity owned or controlled by the

exempt or authorized.
    (e) NGOs relying on the authorization in paragraph (a) of this 
section must submit a report to the U.S. Department of State via email 
at <a href="/cdn-cgi/l/email-protection#296d797b6204676e66046e650467465d404f404a485d404647046d65695a5d485d4c074e465f"><span class="__cf_email__" data-cfemail="c387939188ee8d848cee848fee8dacb7aaa5aaa0a2b7aaacadee878f83b0b7a2b7a6eda4acb5">[email&#160;protected]</span></a> no fewer than 30 days before

    (5) The dates or duration of the activities.
    (2) U.S. Department of State confirmation. The U.S. Department of 
State may notify an NGO within the 2-week period following submission 
of the report described in this paragraph (e) to inform the NGO that it 
may not rely upon this section.
    (f) Specific licenses may be issued on a case-by-case basis to 
authorize NGOs or other entities to engage in other activities designed

removal of landmines and economic development projects to directly 
benefit the civilian population of North Korea.

person authorized thereunder from complying with any other 
applicable laws or regulations.

3. Add Sec.  510.520 to read as follows:

    (3) Purchasing, leasing, or renting North Korean-origin goods and

States;
    (4) Renting and using telecommunications facilities in North Korea 
and paying fees or taxes related to the dissemination of information

    (6) Paying for all expenses ordinarily incident and necessary to 
journalistic activities, including sales or employment taxes to the 
Government of North Korea.

    Note 1 to paragraph (a).  This section does not relieve any

license from the Department of Commerce is required to export or 
reexport any item (commodities, software, or technology) subject to 
the EAR to North Korea, except food and medicine designated as 
EAR99, unless a license exception applies.



[[Page 12236]]


    Note 2 to paragraph (a).  See Sec.  510.520 for a general 
license authorizing transactions ordinarily incident to the 
exportation or reexportation to North Korea of items that are 
licensed or otherwise authorized by the Department of Commerce.

    (b) For the purposes of this section, the term ``news reporting 
organization'' means an entity whose primary purpose is the gathering 
and dissemination of news to the general public.

    Note 3 to Sec.  510.522.  As of September 1, 2017, the U.S. 
Department of State has restricted the use of U.S. passports to 
travel into, in, or through North Korea. See 22 CFR 51.63. U.S. 
nationals who wish to travel to or within North Korea for the 
extremely limited purposes that are set forth in Federal regulations 
must apply for a passport with a special validation from the 
Department of State. See <a href="http://travel.state.gov">travel.state.gov</a> for additional details.
