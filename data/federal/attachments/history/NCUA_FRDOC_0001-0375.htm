SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION: 
    OMB Number: 3133-NEW.
    Title: NCUA Speaker and Chairman Request Forms.
    Type of Review: New collection.
    Abstract: The Federal Credit Union (FCU) Act of 1970 (12 U.S.C. 
1752) established the National Credit Union Administration (NCUA) as an 
independent agency, in control of regulating and supervising federal 
credit unions. This mission requires coordination and collaboration 
with credit unions, other federal agencies, and consumers to provide a 
safe and sound credit union system. As part of its collaboration 
efforts, the NCUA receives requests annually for NCUA leadership and 
staff to participate in speaking engagements at various events. This 
digital collection of information is necessary to ensure an efficient 
and timely process to schedule outreach and engagement with NCUA 
stakeholders. As a result of the requests received for speaking 
engagements, the NCUA has developed two forms, (1) the Speaker Request 
Form and, (2) the Chairman Request Form; and is requesting approval 
from the Office of Management and Budget (OMB) for a new information 
collection. The forms collect information regarding the requested 
speaking engagement to include, the host organization, the speaking 
topic, agenda, and additional event details. The information is used to 
determine if accepting the request will further NCUA's mission.
    NCUA published a 60-day notice on August 28, 2023 requesting 
comments under 88 FR 58621 and one comment was received. The commenter 
made four requests.
    (1) To streamline request forms including NCUA reevaluating the 
forms to ensure all fields are relevant. The NCUA reevaluated the 
request forms, and we think that NCUA is collecting necessary 
information. Because NCUA Board members and Senior Leaders have limited 
time to speak to external entities, NCUA needs comprehensive 
information on each request in order to evaluate and prioritize the 
events at which each NCUA official will speak.
    (2) The commenter asked that NCUA detail both in a written 
communication to credit unions and on its website exactly what is 
required to request a meeting with agency staff. NCUA considered this 
request. We believe that our website is fairly clear on what is 
required to request an NCUA Board and/or Senior Leader to speak. When 
``NCUA speaker requests'' was Googled, our forms appeared in the search 
result. As the commenter notes, the Chairman Speaker Request Form 
includes helpful information at the top of the form regarding meeting 
requests, specifically indicating which fields are required to be 
completed by a requester. We also understand that trade unions have 
spread the word about using NCUA's forms.
    (3) Provide status updates: The commenter indicated that it ``would 
be very helpful if the generic response regarding receipt of a request 
included contact information for a dedicated staff member who is 
responsible for shepherding such requests through the approval process. 
Additionally, periodic updates regarding the status of a request would 
be beneficial, particularly since many credit unions and credit union 
associations often plan in-person trips to DC that coincide with such 
meetings.'' The NCUA agrees and will provide a point of contact from an 
appropriate NCUA office based on the type of request.
    (4) To share aggregate information: The commenter indicated that it 
would be helpful to have general (aggregate) information regarding the 
number of meeting requests and meetings granted, including whether at 
the Board or staff level--and possibly even the department or division 
in which the staff member works as an addition to the NCUA's Annual 
Report. To the extent possible, NCUA attempts to honor as many speaking 
requests as the NCUA Chairman, the Board Members and other Senior 
leaders are able to accommodate based upon each of their demanding 
schedules.
    Estimated No. of Respondents: 175.
    Estimated No. of Responses per Respondent: 1.
    Estimated Total Annual Responses: 175.
    Estimated Burden Hours per Response: 0.25.
    Estimated Total Annual Burden Hours: 43.75.
    Request for Comments: Comments submitted in response to this notice 
will be summarized and included in the request for Office of Management 
and Budget approval. All comments will become a matter of public 
record. The public is invited to submit comments concerning: (a) 
whether the collection of information is necessary for the proper 
execution of the function of the agency, including whether the 
information will have practical utility; (b) the accuracy of the 
agency's estimate of the burden of the collection of information, 
including the validity of the methodology and assumptions used; (c) 
ways to enhance the quality, utility, and clarity of the information to 
be collected; and (d) ways to minimize the burden of the collection of 
the information on the respondents, including the use of automated 
collection techniques or other forms of information technology.

    By the National Credit Union Administration Board.
Melane Conyers-Ausbrooks,
Secretary of the Board.
