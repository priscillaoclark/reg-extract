Notification of Inflation Adjustments for Civil Money Penalties

AGENCY: Office of the Comptroller of the Currency, Treasury.

ACTION: Notification of monetary penalties 2024.

-----------------------------------------------------------------------

SUMMARY: This document announces changes to the Office of the 
Comptroller of the Currency's (OCC) maximum civil money penalties as 
adjusted for inflation. The inflation adjustments are required to 
implement the Federal Civil Penalties Inflation Adjustment Act of 1990, 
as amended by the Federal Civil Penalties Inflation Adjustment Act 
Improvements Act of 2015.

DATES: The adjusted maximum amount of civil money penalties in this 
document are applicable to penalties assessed on or after January 8, 
2024 for conduct occurring on or after November 2, 2015.

FOR FURTHER INFORMATION CONTACT: Lee Walzer, Counsel, Chief Counsel's 
Office, (202) 649-5490, Office of the Comptroller of the Currency.

SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION: This document announces changes to the 
maximum amount of each civil money penalty (CMP) within the OCC's 
jurisdiction to administer to account for inflation pursuant to the 
Federal Civil Penalties Inflation Adjustment Act of 1990 (the 1990 
Adjustment Act),\1\ as amended by the Federal Civil Penalties Inflation 
Adjustment Act Improvements Act of 2015 (the 2015 Adjustment Act).\2\ 
Under the 1990 Adjustment Act, as amended, federal agencies must make 
annual adjustments to the maximum amount of each CMP they administer. 
The Office of Management and Budget (OMB) is required to issue guidance 
to federal agencies no later than December 15 of each year providing an 
inflation adjustment multiplier (i.e., the inflation adjustment factor 
agencies must use) applicable to CMPs assessed in the following year. 
The agencies are required to publish their CMPs, adjusted pursuant to 
the multiplier provided by the OMB, by January 15 of the applicable 
year.
---------------------------------------------------------------------------

    \1\ Public Law 101-410, Oct. 5, 1990, 104 Stat. 890, codified at 
28 U.S.C. 2461 note.
    \2\ Public Law 114-74, Title VII, section 701(b), Nov. 2, 2015, 
129 Stat. 599, codified at 28 U.S.C. 2461 note.
---------------------------------------------------------------------------

    To the extent an agency codified a CMP amount in its regulations, 
the agency would need to update that amount by regulation. However, if 
an agency codified a formula for making the CMP adjustments, then 
subsequent adjustments can be made solely by notice.\3\ In 2018, the 
OCC published a final regulation that removed the CMP amounts from its 
regulations while updating the CMP amounts for inflation through the 
notice process.\4\
---------------------------------------------------------------------------

    \3\ See OMB Memorandum M-18-03, Implementation of the 2018 
Annual Adjustment Pursuant to the Federal Civil Penalties Inflation 
Adjustment Act Improvements Act of 2015, at 4, which permits 
agencies that have codified the formula to adjust CMPs for inflation 
to update the penalties through a notice rather than a regulation.
    \4\ 83 FR 1517 (Jan. 12, 2018) (final rule); 83 FR 1657 (Jan. 
12, 2018) (2018 CMP Notice).
---------------------------------------------------------------------------

    On December 19, 2023, the OMB issued guidance to affected agencies 
on implementing the required annual adjustment, which included the 
relevant inflation multiplier.\5\ The OCC has applied that multiplier 
to the maximum CMPs allowable in 2023 for national banks and Federal 
savings associations as listed in the 2023 CMP notice \6\ to calculate 
the maximum amount of CMPs that may be assessed by the OCC in 2024.\7\ 
There were no new statutory CMPs administered by the OCC during 2023.
---------------------------------------------------------------------------

    \5\ The inflation adjustment multiplier for 2024 is 1.03241. See 
OMB Memorandum M-24-07, Implementation of Penalty Inflation 
Adjustments for 2024, Pursuant to the Federal Civil Penalties 
Inflation Adjustment Act Improvements Act of 2015 (Dec. 19, 2023).
    \6\ See 88 FR 289 (Jan. 4, 2023).
    \7\ Penalties assessed for violations occurring prior to 
November 2, 2015, will be subject to the maximum amounts set forth 
in the OCC's regulations in effect prior to the enactment of the 
2015 Adjustment Act.
---------------------------------------------------------------------------

    The following charts provide the inflation-adjusted CMPs for use 
beginning on January 8, 2024, pursuant to 12 CFR 19.240(b) and 
109.103(c)(2)
