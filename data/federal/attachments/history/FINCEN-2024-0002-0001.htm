SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION:

I. Statutory and Regulatory Provisions

    FinCEN issued the Beneficial Ownership Information Access and 
Safeguards final rule (the ``BOI Access Rule'') on December 22, 
2023,\1\ regarding access by authorized recipients to beneficial 
ownership information (BOI) that will be reported to FinCEN pursuant to 
Section 6403 of the Corporate Transparency Act (CTA), enacted into law 
as part of National Defense Authorization Act for Fiscal Year 2021 
(NDAA).\2\ The BOI Access Rule implements the strict protocols required 
by the CTA to protect sensitive personally identifiable information 
(PII) reported to FinCEN and establish the circumstances in which 
specified recipients have access to BOI, along with the data protection 
protocols and oversight mechanisms applicable to each recipient 
category. The disclosure of BOI to authorized recipients in accordance 
with appropriate protocols and oversight will help law enforcement and 
national security agencies prevent and combat money laundering, 
terrorist financing, tax fraud, and other illicit activity, as well as 
protect national security.

Public Law 116-283 (Jan. 1, 2021). Division F of the NDAA is the 
Anti-Money Laundering Act of 2020, which includes the CTA. Section 
6403 of the CTA, among other things, amends the Bank Secrecy Act 
(BSA) by adding a new section 5336, Beneficial Ownership Information 
Reporting Requirements, to subchapter II of chapter 53 of title 31, 
United States Code.

    Title: Beneficial Ownership Information (BOI) Requests.
    OMB Control Number: 1506-0077.
    Type of Review: Regular.
    Description: As explained in the regulatory impact analysis (RIA) 
of the BOI Access Rule, the rule requires State, local, and Tribal 
agencies and financial institutions that access BOI to satisfy certain 
security and confidentiality requirements, including establishing 
certain standards and procedures, and developing and implementing 
safeguards. As a prerequisite for access to BOI, the rule also requires 
State, local, and Tribal agencies and financial institutions to provide 
a certification for each BOI request. Along with the certification, 
State, local, and Tribal agencies and financial institutions will also 
provide information by filling out data fields for each BOI request; 
these data fields are set out in the Appendix. While some data fields 
will be optional, others will be required.
    As previewed in the BOI Access Rule, FinCEN is issuing this notice 
with regard to the information collection associated with such BOI 
requests. Thus, this notice seeks comment only on the burden for the 
information collection associated with such BOI requests, which 
corresponds to the burden associated with ``submit[ting] written 
certification for each request that it meets certain requirements.'' 
Further details about those burdens are set forth in the BOI Access 
Rule RIA (see Action G within Tables 1 and 2) and below. Also, as 
previously noted in the BOI Access Rule, FinCEN intends to provide 
additional detail regarding the form and manner of BOI requests for all 
categories of authorized recipients through specific instructions and 
guidance.
    The following analysis represents the entirety of the burden under 
OMB control number 1506-0077, which is associated with the BOI Access 
Rule. FinCEN previously solicited public comment on the full burden of 
the Access Rule, including the certification requirement for the 
information collection associated with BOI requests, as part of that 
rulemaking.
    Form: None.
    Affected Public: State, local and Tribal agencies, self-regulatory 
organizations (SROs), and financial institutions with customer due 
diligence requirements under applicable law, as defined in the final 
BOI access rule. While Federal and foreign requesters are able to 
access BOI after meeting specific requirements, FinCEN does not include 
them in the PRA analysis because the regulations implementing the PRA 
define ``person'' as an individual, partnership, association, 
corporation (including operations of government-owned contractor-
operated facilities), business trust, or legal representative, an 
organized group of individuals, a State, territorial, tribal, or local 
government or branch thereof, or a political subdivision of a State, 
territory, Tribal, or local government or a branch of a political 
subdivision.\4\ For foreign requesters in particular, FinCEN assumes 
that such requests will be made at the national level.
---------------------------------------------------------------------------

    \4\ See 5 CFR 1320.3(k).
---------------------------------------------------------------------------

    Estimated Number of Respondents: 15,934 entities. This total is 
composed of an estimated 215 State, local, and Tribal agencies, of 
which 158 are State, local, and Tribal law enforcement agencies and 57 
are State regulatory agencies, 3 SROs, and 15,716 financial 
institutions.\5\ While the requirements in the rule are only imposed on 
those that optionally access BOI, for purposes of PRA burden analysis, 
FinCEN assumes maximum participation from State, local, and Tribal 
agencies, SROs, and financial institutions.
---------------------------------------------------------------------------

    \5\ See Table 1 in the RIA of the BOI Access Rule for the types 
of financial institutions covered by this notice. 88 FR 88789 (Dec. 
22, 2023).
---------------------------------------------------------------------------

    Frequency of Response: As required; varies depending on the 
requirement.
    Estimated Time per Respondent: See ``Hours per Entity'' column in 
Table 1 below for estimated time for each requirement per respondent.
    Estimated Total Annual Reporting and Recordkeeping Burden: FinCEN 
estimates that during year 1 the annual

[[Page 5997]]

hourly burden will be 8,743,781 hours. In year 2 and onward, FinCEN 
estimates that the annual hourly burden will be 3,616,964 hours. The 
annual estimated burden hours for State, local, and Tribal entities and 
SROs is 2,268,789 hours in the first year, and 1,699,612 hours in year 
2 and onward. As shown in Table 1 below, the hourly burden in year 1 
for State, local, and Tribal agencies and SROs includes the hourly 
burden associated with the following requirements in the rule: enter 
into an agreement with FinCEN and establish standards and procedures 
(Action B); establish a secure system to store BOI (Action D); 
establish and maintain an auditable system of standardized records for 
requests (Action E); submit written certification for each request that 
it meets certain requirements (Action G); restrict access to 
appropriate persons within the entity (Action H); conduct an annual 
audit and cooperate with FinCEN's annual audit (Action I); obtain 
certification of standards and procedures, initially and then semi-
annually, by the head of the entity (Action J); and provide annual 
reports on procedures (Action K). The hourly burden in year 2 and 
onward for State, local, and Tribal agencies and SROs is associated 
with the same requirements as year 1, with the exception of Action B 
because FinCEN expects this action will result in costs for these 
entities in year 1 only.
    The annual estimated hourly burden for financial institutions is 
6,474,992 hours in the first year and 1,917,352 hours in year 2 and 
onward. The hourly burden for financial institutions in year 1 is 
associated with the following: develop and implement administrative and 
physical safeguards (Action A); develop and implement technical 
safeguards (Action C); obtain and document customer consent (Action F); 
submit certification for each request that it meets certain 
requirements (Action G); undergo training (Action H); comply with 
certain geographic restrictions (Action L); and notify FinCEN if they 
receive an information demand from a foreign government (Action M). The 
hourly burden in year 2 and onward for financial institutions is 
associated only with the requirements for Actions F, G, and H because 
FinCEN expects the other actions will result in costs for these 
entities in year 1 only.
    Annual estimated burden declines in year 2 and onward because 
State, local, and Tribal agencies, SROs, and financial institutions no 
longer need to complete Actions A and B, and have a lower hourly burden 
for Actions E and F. State, local, and Tribal law enforcement agencies 
have a lower hourly burden for Action G. Table 1 lists the type of 
entity, the number of entities, the hours per entity, and the total 
hourly burden by action. For Actions A, B, C, D, E, F, I, J, K, L, and 
M the hours per entity are the maximum of the range estimated in the 
cost analysis of the RIA. For Action G and H, the hours per entity 
calculations are specified in footnotes to Table 1. Total annual hourly 
burden is calculated by multiplying the number of entities by the hours 
per entity for each action. In each subsequent year after initial 
implementation, FinCEN estimates that the total hourly annual burden is 
3,616,964. This results in a 5-year average burden estimate of 
approximately 4,642,327 hours.\6\
---------------------------------------------------------------------------

    \6\ The 5-year average equals the sum of (Year 1 burden hours of 
8,743,781 + Year 2 burden hours of 3,616,964 + Year 3 burden hours 
of 3,616,964 + Year 4 burden hours of 3,616,964 + Year 5 burden 
hours of 3,616,964) divided by 5.
---------------------------------------------------------------------------

    This notice seeks comment on the estimated total annual reporting 
and recordkeeping burden for the information collection associated with 
BOI requests, specifically the requirement to submit written 
certification for each request that it meets certain requirements 
(Action G in Table 1 below). FinCEN previously provided notice and an 
opportunity for public comment on all actions that constitute the 
reporting and recordkeeping burden associated with the BOI Access Rule, 
including the certification requirement, as well as the estimated total 
annual burden, through the BOI Access rulemaking. As explained above, 
FinCEN is issuing this notice with regard to the information collection 
associated with BOI requests; therefore, this notice seeks comment only 
on the certification requirement.

----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
\1\ For all types of entities, the hours per entity for Action G is the per entity share of the aggregate burden
  estimated in the RIA.
\2\ For financial institutions, the hours per entity for Action H equals the weighted average of the large and
  small financial institutions' maximum burden estimated in the RIA.
\3\ For State, local, and Tribal agencies and SROs, the hours per entity for Action H equals the per entity
  share of the aggregate burden.

    Estimated Total Annual Reporting and Recordkeeping Cost: As 
described in Table 3 of the BOI Access Rule RIA, FinCEN calculated the 
fully loaded hourly wage for each type of affected entity type.\7\ 
Using these estimated wages, the total cost of the annual burden in 
year 1 is $868,200,270. In year 2 and onward, FinCEN estimates that the 
total cost of the annual burden is $339,309,502, owing to Actions A and 
B only imposing burdens in year 1, Actions D and E having lower annual 
per entity burdens, and Action G having lower burden per request for 
State, local, and Tribal law enforcement agencies. The annual estimated 
cost for State, local, and Tribal agencies and SROs is $181,851,118 in 
the first year and $136,070,190 in year 2 and onward. The annual 
estimated cost for financial institutions is $686,349,152 in the first 
year and $203,239,312 in year 2 and onward. The 5-year average annual 
cost estimate is $445,087,656.\8\
---------------------------------------------------------------------------

    \7\ 88 FR 88791 (Dec. 22, 2023).
    \8\ The 5-year average equals the sum of (Year 1 costs of 
$868,200,270 + Year 2 costs of $339,309,502 + Year 3 costs of 
$339,309,502 + Year 4 costs of $339,309,502 + Year 5 costs of 
$339,309,502) divided by 5.

    This notice seeks comment on the estimated total annual reporting 
and recordkeeping cost for the information collection associated with 
BOI requests, specifically the requirement to ``submit written 
certification for each request that it meets certain requirements'' 
(Action G in Table 2 below). FinCEN previously provided notice and an 
opportunity for public comment on all actions that constitute the 
reporting and recordkeeping cost associated with the BOI Access Rule, 
including the certification requirement, as well as the estimated total 
annual reporting and recordkeeping cost, through the BOI Access 
rulemaking. As FinCEN is issuing this notice with regard to the 
information collection associated with BOI requests, this notice seeks 
comment only on the certification requirement.
