    Section 19(b)(2) of the Act \4\ provides that, within 45 days of 
the publication of notice of the filing of a proposed rule change, or 
within such longer period up to 90 days as the Commission may designate 
if it finds such longer period to be appropriate and publishes its 
reasons for so finding, or as to which the self-regulatory organization 
consents, the Commission shall either approve the proposed rule change, 
disapprove the proposed rule change, or institute proceedings to 
determine whether the proposed rule change should be disapproved. The 
45th day after publication of the notice for this proposed rule change 
is March 1, 2024.

pursuant to section 19(b)(2) of the Act,\5\ designates April 15, 2024, 
as the date by which the Commission shall either approve or disapprove, 
or institute proceedings to determine whether to disapprove, the 
proposed rule change (File No. SR-CboeBZX-2023-107).
