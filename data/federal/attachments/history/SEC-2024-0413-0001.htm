website at <a href="https://listingcenter.nasdaq.com/rulebook/nasdaq/rules">https://listingcenter.nasdaq.com/rulebook/nasdaq/rules</a>, at 
the principal office of the Exchange, and at the Commission's Public 
Reference Room.

II. Self-Regulatory Organization's Statement of the Purpose of, and 
Statutory Basis for, the Proposed Rule Change

    In its filing with the Commission, the Exchange included statements 
concerning the purpose of and basis for the proposed rule change and 
discussed any comments it received on the proposed rule change. The 
text of these statements may be examined at the places specified in 
Item IV below. The Exchange has prepared summaries, set forth in 
sections A, B, and C below, of the most significant aspects of such 
statements.

A. Self-Regulatory Organization's Statement of the Purpose of, and 
Statutory Basis for, the Proposed Rule Change

1. Purpose
    The Exchange proposes to amend Options 7, Section 3, Nasdaq Options 
Market--Ports and Other Services. Specifically, the Exchange proposes 
to amend Options 7, Section 3(i) to increase the per port, per month 
SQF Port \4\ and SQF Purge \5\ Port Fees for all ports over 20 ports 
(21 and above) from $500 to $750.\6\
---------------------------------------------------------------------------

    \4\ ``Specialized Quote Feed'' or ``SQF'' is an interface that 
allows Market Makers to connect, send, and receive messages related 
to quotes and Immediate-or-Cancel Orders into and from the Exchange. 
Features include the following: (1) options symbol directory 
messages (e.g., underlying instruments); (2) system event messages 
(e.g., start of trading hours messages and start of opening); (3) 
trading action messages (e.g., halts and resumes); (4) execution 
messages; (5) quote messages; (6) Immediate-or-Cancel Order 
messages; (7) risk protection triggers and purge notifications; and 
(8) opening imbalance messages. The SQF Purge Interface only 
receives and notifies of purge requests from the Market Maker. 
Market Makers may only enter interest into SQF in their assigned 
options series. Immediate-or-Cancel Orders entered into SQF are not 
subject to the Order Price Protection, Market Order Spread 
Protection, or Size Limitation in Options 3, Section 15(a)(1) and 
(a)(2), and (b)(2), respectively. See Options 3, Section 7(e)(1)(B).
    \5\ SQF Purge is a specific port for the SQF interface that only 
receives and notifies of purge requests from the NOM Market Maker.
    \6\ The Exchange also proposes a technical amendment to remove 
an extraneous period in Options 7, Section 3 in the second 
paragraph.
---------------------------------------------------------------------------

    Today, NOM assesses SQF Ports and SQF Purge Ports a per port, per 
month fee based on a tiered fee schedule. Specifically, NOM assesses an 
SQF Port and an SQF Purge Port fee of $1,500 per port, per month for 
the first 5 ports (1-5), a $1,000 per port, per month fee for the next 
15 ports (6-20), and a $750 per port, per month fee for all ports over 
20 ports (21 and above).
    At this time, the Exchange proposes to amend the per port, per 
month fee for SQF Ports and SQF Ports above 20 ports

[[Page 21046]]

(21 and above) from $500 to $750 per port, per month. The Exchange is 
not amending the SQF Port and SQF Purge Port fees for ports below 20 
ports.
    Pursuant to Options 3, Section 7(e)(1)(B), NOM Market Makers may 
only enter interest into SQF in their assigned options series. Pursuant 
to Options 3, Section 7(e)(1)(B), the SQF interface allows NOM Market 
Makers to connect, send, and receive messages related to quotes, 
Immediate-or-Cancel Orders, and auction responses to the Exchange. A 
NOM Market Maker requires only one SQF Port to submit quotes in its 
assigned options series into NOM. An SQF Purge is a specific port for 
the SQF interface that only receives and notifies of purge requests 
from the Market Maker. A NOM Market Maker may submit all quotes through 
one SQF Port and utilize one SQF Purge Port to view its purge requests. 
While a NOM Market Maker may elect to obtain multiple SQF Ports and SQF 
Purge Ports to organize its business,\7\ only one SQF Port and SQF 
Purge Port is necessary for a NOM Market Maker to fulfill its 
regulatory quoting obligations.\8\
---------------------------------------------------------------------------

    \7\ For example, a NOM Market Maker may desire to utilize 
multiple SQF Ports for accounting purposes, to measure performance, 
for regulatory reasons or other determinations that are specific to 
that NOM Participant. The Exchange notes that 78% of NOM Market 
Makers pay the $1,000 per port, per month fee for 6-20 ports and 39% 
pay the proposed $750 per port, per month fee for over 20 ports.
    \8\ NOM Market Makers have various regulatory requirements as 
provided for in Options 2, Section 4. Additionally, NOM Market 
Makers have certain quoting requirements with respect to their 
assigned options series as provided in Options 2, Section 5. The 
Exchange notes that SQF Ports are the only quoting protocol 
available on NOM and only NOM Market Makers may utilize SQF Ports. 
The same is true for SQF Purge Ports.
---------------------------------------------------------------------------

2. Statutory Basis
    The Exchange believes that its proposal is consistent with Section 
6(b) of the Act,\9\ in general, and furthers the objectives of Sections 
6(b)(4) and 6(b)(5) of the Act,\10\ in particular, in that it provides 
for the equitable allocation of reasonable dues, fees, and other 
charges among members and issuers and other persons using any facility, 
and is not designed to permit unfair discrimination between customers, 
issuers, brokers, or dealers.
---------------------------------------------------------------------------

    \9\ 15 U.S.C. 78f(b).
    \10\ 15 U.S.C. 78f(b)(4) and (5).
---------------------------------------------------------------------------

    The Exchange believes that increasing the fee for SQF Ports and SQF 
Purge Ports over 20 ports (21 and above) from $500 to $750 per port, 
per month is reasonable because SQF Ports and SQF Purge Ports over 20 
ports are unnecessary for a NOM Market Maker to fulfill its regulatory 
requirements.\11\ A NOM Market Maker requires only one SQF Port to 
submit quotes in its assigned options series into NOM. A NOM Market 
Maker may submit all quotes through one SQF Port and utilize one SQF 
Purge Port to view its purge requests. While a NOM Market Maker may 
elect to obtain multiple SQF Ports and SQF Purge Ports to organize its 
business,\12\ only one SQF Port and SQF Purge Port is necessary for a 
NOM Market Maker to fulfill its regulatory quoting obligations. 
Participants may choose a greater number of SQF Ports or SQF Purge 
Ports, beyond one port, depending on that Participant's particular 
business model. Additionally, the Exchange believes the proposed SQF 
Port and SQF Purge Port fee increases are reasonable for two reasons.
---------------------------------------------------------------------------

    \11\ See NOM Options 2, Sections 4 and 5.
    \12\ For example, a NOM Market Maker may desire to utilize 
multiple SQF Ports for accounting purposes, to measure performance, 
for regulatory reasons or other determinations that are specific to 
that Participant.
---------------------------------------------------------------------------

    First, SQF Ports are a secure method for Market Makers to submit 
quotes into the Exchange's match engine and for the Exchange to send 
messages related to those quotes to Market Makers. NOM must manage the 
security and message traffic, among other things, for each port. 
Amending the SQF Port and SQF Purge Port tiered fees to manage a Market 
Maker's costs while also managing the quantity of SQF Ports and SQF 
Purge Ports issued on NOM has led the Exchange to increase the tier for 
all ports over 20 ports to $750 per port, per month. Lowering the fee 
for SQF Ports and SQF Purge Ports over 20 ports allows the Exchange to 
manage message traffic and message rates associated with the current 
number of outstanding SQF Port and SQF Purge Ports and consider the 
Exchange's ability to process messages. The ability to manage ports 
through pricing permits the Exchange to scale its needs with respect to 
processing messages in an efficient manner. The Exchange notes that 
Cboe Exchange, Inc. (``Cboe'') limits usage on each port and assesses 
fees for incremental usage.\13\
---------------------------------------------------------------------------

    \13\ Each Cboe Binary Order Entry (``BOE'') or FIX Logical Port 
incur the logical port fee indicated when used to enter up to 70,000 
orders per trading day per logical port as measured on average in a 
single month. For each incremental usage of up to 70,000 per day per 
logical port will incur an additional logical port fee of $800 per 
month. BOE or FIX Logical Ports provide users the ability to enter 
order/quotes. See Cboe's Fees Schedule.
---------------------------------------------------------------------------

    Second, the Exchange notes that multiple ports are not necessary, 
however, to the extent that some Market Makers elect to obtain multiple 
ports, the Exchange is offering to lower their fees for SQF Ports and 
SQF Purge Ports over 20 ports, per month. NOM believes that lowering 
costs for ports beyond 20 ports allows for efficiencies and permits 
Market Makers to increase their number of ports beyond the 20 ports. 
Lowering the SQF Port and SQF Purge Port fees, per month, beyond 20 
ports allows those Market Makers that want to obtain a larger number of 
SQF Port and SQF Purge ports to do so at a lower cost. In this case, 
the Exchange is raising the current SQF Port and SQF Purge Port Fee for 
over 20 ports from $500 to $750 per port, per month. Despite the 
increase, Market Makers will continue to pay less for over 20 SQF Port 
and SQF Purge Ports per month if they desire to obtain multiple ports 
on NOM. BOX Exchange LLC (``BOX'') assesses $1,000 per month for all 
SAIL Ports for Market Making and $500 per month per port up to 5 ports 
for order entry and $150 per month for each additional port.\14\ Miami 
International Securities Exchange's (``MIAX'') MIAX Express Interface 
(``MEI'') Fee levels are based on a tiered fee structure based on the 
Market Maker's total monthly executed volume during the relevant 
month.\15\
---------------------------------------------------------------------------

    \14\ See BOX's Fee Schedule.
    \15\ MEI is a connection to MIAX systems that enables Market 
Makers to submit simple and complex electronic quotes to MIAX. MIAX 
caps its MEI Ports. For these Monthly MIAX MEI Fees levels, if the 
Market Maker's total monthly executed volume during the relevant 
month is less than 0.060% of the total monthly executed volume 
reported by OCC in the market maker account type for MIAX-listed 
option classes for that month, then the fee will be $14,500 instead 
of the fee otherwise applicable to such level. See MIAX's Fee 
Schedule.
---------------------------------------------------------------------------

    The number of ports that members choose to purchase varies widely. 
Today, on NOM, 3 Market Makers have 1 SQF Port/SQF Purge Port, 1 Market 
Maker has 2-5 SQF Ports/SQF Purge Ports, 3 Market Makers have between 
6-10 SQF Ports/SQF Purge Ports, and 11 Market Makers have more than 10 
SQF Ports/SQF Purge Ports. The chart below represents the number of SQF 
Ports and SQF Purge Ports that are subscribed to by members across the 
six Nasdaq affiliated options markets.

[[Page 21047]]

[GRAPHIC] [TIFF OMITTED] TN26MR24.014

    The Exchange believes that increasing the fee for SQF Ports and SQF 
Purge Ports over 20 ports (21 and above) from $500 to $750 per port, 
per month is equitable and not unfairly discriminatory because all NOM 
Market Makers would be assessed the same fees for SQF Ports and SQF 
Purge Ports to the extent that these NOM Market Makers have subscribed 
to more than 20 SQF Ports or SQF Purge Ports. NOM Market Makers are the 
only market participants that are assessed SQF Port and SQF Purge Port 
fees because they are the only market participants that are permitted 
to quote on the Exchange. SQF Ports and SQF Purge Ports are only 
utilized in the Market Maker's assigned options series. The following 
chart represents the classification of NOM Members and the percentage 
of Market Makers.

[[Page 21048]]


    Unlike other market participants, NOM Market Makers are subject to 
market making and quoting obligations.\16\ These liquidity providers 
are critical market participants in that they are the only market 
participants that provide liquidity to NOM on a continuous basis. 
Providing NOM Market Makers a means to cap their cost related to 
quoting and enabling all Market Makers to acquire SQF Ports and SQF 
Purge Ports at a lower cost beyond 20 ports enables these market 
participants to provide the necessary liquidity to NOM at lower costs. 
Therefore, because NOM Market Makers fulfill a unique role on the 
Exchange, are the only market participant required to submit quotes as 
part of their obligations to operate on the Exchange, and, in light of 
that role, they are eligible for certain incentives. The proposed SQF 
Port and SQF Purge Fee cap is designed to continue to incent NOM Market 
Makers to quote on NOM, thereby promoting liquidity, quote competition, 
and trading opportunities.
---------------------------------------------------------------------------

    \16\ See Options 2, Sections 4 and 5.
---------------------------------------------------------------------------

    In 2022, NYSE Arca, Inc. (``NYSE Arca'') proposed to restructure 
fees relating to OTPs for Market Makers.\17\ In that rule change,\18\ 
NYSE Arca argued that,
---------------------------------------------------------------------------

    \17\ See Securities Exchange Act Release No. 95412 (June 23, 
2022), 87 FR 38786 (June 29, 2022) (SR-NYSEArca-2022-36). NYSE Arca 
proposed to increase both the monthly fee per Market Maker OTP and 
the number of issues covered by each additional OTP because, among 
other reasons, the number of issues traded on the Exchange has 
increased significantly in recent years.
    \18\ Id at 38788.

    Market Makers serve a unique and important function on the 
Exchange (and other options exchanges) given the quote-driven nature 
of options markets. Because options exchanges rely on actively 
quoting Market Makers to facilitate a robust marketplace that 
attracts order flow, options exchanges must attract and retain 
Market Makers, including by setting competitive Market Maker permit 
fees. Stated otherwise, changes to Market Maker permit fees can have 
a direct effect on the ability of an exchange to compete for order 
flow. The Exchange also believes that the number of options 
exchanges on which Market Makers can effect option transactions also 
ensures competition in the marketplace and constrains the ability of 
exchanges to charge supracompetitive fees for access to its market 
---------------------------------------------------------------------------
by Market Makers.

    Further, NYSE ARCA noted that,\19\
---------------------------------------------------------------------------

    \19\ Id at 38790.

    The Exchange further believes that its ability to set Market 
Maker permit fees is constrained by competitive forces based on the 
fact that Market Makers can, and have, chosen to terminate their 
status as a Market Maker if they deem Market Maker permit fees to be 
unreasonable or excessive. Specifically, the Exchange notes that a 
BOX participant modified its access to BOX in connection with the 
implementation of a proposed change to BOX's Market Maker permit 
fees. The Exchange has also observed that another options exchange 
group experienced decreases in market share following its proposed 
modifications of its access fees (including Market Maker trading 
permit fees), suggesting that market participants (including Market 
Makers) are sensitive to changes in exchanges' access fees and may 
respond by shifting their order flow elsewhere if they deem the fees 
to be unreasonable or excessive.
    There is no requirement, regulatory or otherwise, that any 
Market Maker connect to and access any (or all of) the available 
options exchanges. The Exchange also is not aware of any reason why 
a Market Maker could not cease being a permit holder in response to 
unreasonable price increases. The Exchange does not assess any 
termination fee for a Market Maker to drop its OTP, nor is the 
Exchange aware of any other costs that would be incurred by a Market 
Maker to do so.

    The Exchange likewise believes that its lower SQF Ports and SQF 
Purge Port monthly fees beyond 20 ports is constrained by competitive 
forces and that its proposed modifications to the SQF Port and SQF 
Purge Fees is reasonably designed in consideration of the competitive 
environment in which the Exchange operates, by balancing the value of 
the enhanced benefits available to Market Makers due to the current 
level of activity on the Exchange with a fee structure that will 
continue to incent Market Makers to support increased liquidity, quote 
competition, and trading opportunities on the Exchange, for the benefit 
of all market participants.

B. Self-Regulatory Organization's Statement on Burden on Competition

    The Exchange does not believe that the proposed rule change will 
impose any burden on competition not necessary or appropriate in 
furtherance of the purposes of the Act.
Intermarket Competition
    The proposal does not impose an undue burden on intermarket 
competition. The Exchange believes its proposal remains competitive 
with other options markets who also offer order entry protocols. The 
Exchange notes that it operates in a highly competitive market in which 
market participants can readily favor competing venues if they deem fee 
levels at a particular venue to be excessive. The chart below shows the 
February 2024 market share for multiply listed options by exchange. Of 
the 17 operating options exchanges, none currently has more than a 
17.6% market share. Customers widely distribute their transactions 
across exchanges according to their business needs and the ability of 
each exchange to meet those needs through technology, liquidity and 
functionality.

[[Page 21049]]

[GRAPHIC] [TIFF OMITTED] TN26MR24.016

    Market share is the percentage of volume on a particular exchange 
relative to the total volume across all exchanges, and indicates the 
amount of order flow directed to that exchange. High levels of market 
share enhance the value of trading and ports.
    In such an environment, the Exchange must continually adjust its 
fees to remain competitive with other exchanges. Because competitors 
are free to modify their own fees in response, and because market 
participants may readily adjust their order routing practices, the 
Exchange believes that the degree to which fee changes in this market 
may impose any burden on competition is extremely limited.
    Other exchanges amended certain costs attributed to NOM Market 
Makers.\20\ In 2022, MRX proposed a monthly cap for SQF Ports and SQF 
Purge Ports of 17,500.\21\ MRX noted in its rule change that, ``Only 
one SQF quote protocol is required for an MRX Market Maker to submit 
quotes into MRX and to meet its regulatory requirements.'' \22\ 
Additionally, BOX assesses $1,000 per month for all SAIL Ports for 
Market Making and $500 per month per port up to 5 ports for order entry 
and $150 per month for each additional port.\23\ MIAX's MEI Fee levels 
are based on a tiered fee structure based on the Market Maker's total 
monthly executed volume during the relevant month.\24\
---------------------------------------------------------------------------

    \20\ See Securities Exchange Act Release No. 95412 (June 23, 
2022), 87 FR 38786 (June 29, 2022) (SR-NYSEArca-2022-36).
    \21\ See Securities Exchange Act No. 96824(February 7, 2023), 88 
FR 8975 (February 10, 2023) (SR-MRX-2023-05) (Notice of Filing and 
Immediate Effectiveness of Proposed Rule Change To Amend MRX Options 
7, Section 6).
    \22\ Id at 8976.
    \23\ See BOX's Fee Schedule.
    \24\ MEI is a connection to MIAX systems that enables Market 
Makers to submit simple and complex electronic quotes to MIAX. MIAX 
caps its MEI Ports. For these Monthly MIAX MEI Fees levels, if the 
Market Maker's total monthly executed volume during the relevant 
month is less than 0.060% of the total monthly executed volume 
reported by OCC in the market maker account type for MIAX-listed 
option classes for that month, then the fee will be $14,500 instead 
of the fee otherwise applicable to such level. See MIAX's Fee 
Schedule.
---------------------------------------------------------------------------

    If the Commission were to apply a different standard of review this 
proposal than it applied to other exchange fee filings, where Market 
Maker fees were increased and port fee caps were established, it would 
create a burden on competition such that it would impair NOM's ability 
to compete among other options markets.
Intramarket Competition
    The Exchange believes that increasing the fee for SQF Ports and SQF 
Purge Ports over 20 ports (21 and above) from $500 to $750 per port, 
per month does not impose an undue burden on competition because all 
NOM Market Makers would be assessed the same fees for SQF Ports and SQF 
Purge Ports to the extent that these NOM Market Makers have subscribed 
to more than 20 SQF Ports or SQF Purge Ports. NOM Market Makers are the 
only market participants that are assessed SQF Port and SQF Purge Port 
fees because they are the only market participants that are permitted 
to quote on the Exchange. SQF Ports and SQF Purge Ports are only 
utilized in the Market Maker's assigned options series. Unlike other 
market participants, NOM Market Makers are subject to market making and 
quoting obligations.\25\ These liquidity providers are critical market 
participants in that they are the only market participants that provide 
liquidity to NOM on a continuous basis. Providing NOM Market Makers a 
means to cap their cost related to quoting and enabling all Market 
Makers to acquire SQF Ports and SQF Purge Ports at a lower cost beyond 
20 ports enables these market participants to provide the necessary 
liquidity to NOM at lower costs. Therefore, because NOM Market Makers 
fulfill a unique role on the Exchange, are the only market participant 
required to submit quotes as part of their obligations to operate on 
the Exchange, and, in light of that role, they are eligible for certain 
incentives. The proposed lower monthly SQF Fee and SQF Purge Port fee 
is designed to continue to incent NOM Market Makers to quote on NOM, 
thereby promoting liquidity, quote competition, and trading 
opportunities.
