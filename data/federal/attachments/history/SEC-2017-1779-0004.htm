SECURITIES AND EXCHANGE COMMISSION

[SEC File No. 270-399, OMB Control No. 3235-0456]


Proposed Collection; Comment Request; Extension: Form 24F-2

Upon Written Request, Copies Available From: Securities and Exchange 
Commission, Office of FOIA Services, 100 F Street NE, Washington, DC 
20549-2736

    Notice is hereby given that pursuant to the Paperwork Reduction Act 
of 1995 (44 U.S.C. 3501-3520), the Securities and Exchange Commission 
(the ``Commission'') is soliciting comments on the collection of 
information summarized below. The Commission plans to submit this 
existing collection of information to the Office of Management and 
Budget for extension and approval.
    Rule 24f-2 (17 CFR 270.24f-2) under the Investment Company Act of 
1940 (15 U.S.C. 80a) requires any open-end investment companies, unit 
investment trusts (``UITs''), registered closed-end investment 
companies that make periodic repurchase offers under rule 23c-3 under 
the Investment Company Act [17 CFR 270.23c-3] (``interval funds''), and 
face-amount certificate companies (collectively, ``funds'') deemed to 
have registered an indefinite amount of securities to file, not later 
than 90 days after the end of any fiscal year in which it has publicly 
offered such securities, Form 24F-2 (17 CFR 274.24) with the 
Commission. Form 24F-2 is the annual notice of securities sold by funds 
that accompanies the payment of registration fees with respect to the 
securities sold during the fiscal year.
    The Commission estimates that 5,116 funds file Form 24F-2 on the 
required annual basis. The average annual burden per respondent for 
Form 24F-2 is estimated to be four hours. The total annual burden for 
all respondents to Form 24F-2 is estimated to be 20,464 hours. The 
estimate of average burden hours is made solely for the purposes of the 
Paperwork Reduction Act and is not derived from a comprehensive or even 
a representative survey or study of the costs of Commission rules.
    Compliance with the collection of information required by Form 24F-
2 is mandatory. The Form 24F-2 filing that must be made to the 
Commission is available to the public. An agency may not conduct or 
sponsor, and a person is not required to respond to, a collection of 
information unless it displays a currently valid control number.
    Written comments are invited on: (a) whether the proposed 
collection of information is necessary for the proper performance of 
the functions of the Commission, including whether the information 
shall have practical utility; (b) the accuracy of the Commission's 
estimate of the burden of the collection of information; (c) ways to 
enhance the quality, utility, and clarity of the information collected; 
and (d) ways to minimize the burden of the collection of information on 
respondents, including through the use of automated collection 
techniques or other forms of information technology. Consideration will 
be given to comments and suggestions submitted by March 11, 2024.
    An agency may not conduct or sponsor, and a person is not required 
to respond to, a collection of information under the PRA unless it 
displays a currently valid OMB control number.
    Please direct your written comments to: David Bottom, Director/
Chief Information Officer, Securities and Exchange Commission, c/o John 
Pezzullo, 100 F Street NE, Washington, DC 20549 or send an email to:

Assistant Secretary.
