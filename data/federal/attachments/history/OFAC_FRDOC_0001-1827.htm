the following products of Russian Federation origin: fish, seafood, and 
preparations thereof; alcoholic beverages; non-industrial diamonds; and 
any other products of Russian Federation origin, as may be determined 
by the Secretary of the Treasury, in consultation with the Secretary of 
State and the Secretary of Commerce.
    Section 1(a)(i)(B) of E.O. 14068 as amended prohibits the 
importation and entry into the United States, including importation for 
admission into a foreign trade zone located in the United States, of

Secretary of the Treasury, in consultation with the Secretary of State, 
the Secretary of Commerce, and the Secretary of Homeland Security, that 
were mined, extracted, produced, or manufactured wholly or in part in 
the Russian Federation, or harvested in waters under the jurisdiction 
of the Russian Federation or by Russia-flagged vessels, notwithstanding 
whether such products have been incorporated or substantially 
transformed into other products outside of the Russian Federation. The 
products subject to section 1(a)(i)(B) include fish, seafood, and 
preparations thereof; diamonds; and any other such products as may be 
determined by the Secretary of the Treasury, in consultation with the 
Secretary of State, the Secretary of Commerce, and the Secretary of 
Homeland Security.
    Section 1(a)(i)(D) of E.O. 14068 as amended prohibits the 
importation and entry into the United States, including importation for 
admission into a foreign trade zone located in the United States, of 
products subject to the prohibitions of sections 1(a)(i)(A) through (C) 
of E.O. 14068 as amended that transited through or were exported from 
or by the Russian Federation, as may be determined by the Secretary of 
the Treasury, in consultation with the Secretary of State, the
