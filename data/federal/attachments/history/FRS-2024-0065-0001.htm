SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION: On June 15, 1984, OMB delegated to the Board

sponsored by the Board. In exercising this delegated authority, the 
Board is directed to take every reasonable step to solicit comment. In 
determining whether to approve a collection of information, the Board 
will consider all comments received from the public and other agencies.
    During the comment period for this proposal, a copy of the proposed 
PRA OMB submission, including the draft reporting form and 
instructions, supporting statement (which contains more detail about 
the information collection and burden estimates than this notice), and 
other documentation, will be made available on the Board's public 
website at <a href="https://www.federalreserve.gov/apps/reportingforms/home/review">https://www.federalreserve.gov/apps/reportingforms/home/review</a> or may be requested from the agency clearance officer, whose

Request for Comment on Information Collection Proposal

    The Board invites public comment on the following information 
collection, which is being reviewed under authority delegated by the 
OMB under the PRA. Comments are invited on the following:
    a. Whether the proposed collection of information is necessary for 
the proper performance of the Board's functions, including whether the 
information has practical utility;
    b. The accuracy of the Board's estimate of the burden of the 
proposed information collection, including the validity of the 
methodology and assumptions used;
    c. Ways to enhance the quality, utility, and clarity of the 
information to be collected;
    d. Ways to minimize the burden of information collection on 
respondents, including through the use of automated collection 
techniques or other forms of information technology; and
    e. Estimates of capital or startup costs and costs of operation, 
maintenance, and purchase of services to provide information.
    At the end of the comment period, the comments and recommendations 
received will be analyzed to determine the extent to which the Board 
should modify the proposal.

Proposal Under OMB Delegated Authority To Extend for Three Years, 
Without Revision, the Following Information Collection

    Collection title: Survey of Consumer Finances.
    Collection identifier: FR 3059.
    OMB control number: 7100-0287.
    General description of collection: This triennial survey is the 
only source of representative information on the structure of U.S. 
families' finances. The survey collects data on the assets, debts, 
income, work history, pension rights, use of financial services, and 
attitudes of a sample of U.S. families. Because the ownership of some 
assets is relatively concentrated in a small number of families, the 
survey makes a special effort to ensure proper representation of such 
assets by systematically oversampling wealthier families. For the 2025 
survey, the Board will conduct: (1) up to 150 interviews averaging 
about 110 minutes (pretest) to be obtained in a test or series of tests 
of the survey procedures in 2025, and (2) up to 7,000 interviews 
averaging about 110 minutes (main survey) between April 2025 and March 
2026.
    Frequency: Triennial.
    Respondents: U.S. families.
    Total estimated number of respondents: 7,150.
    Total estimated annual burden hours: 4,410.\1\
