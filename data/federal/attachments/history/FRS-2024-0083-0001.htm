Final Approval Under OMB Delegated Authority of the Extension for Three 
Years, With Revision, of the Following Information Collection

    Collection title: Reporting, Recordkeeping, and Disclosure 
Requirements Associated with Regulation LL.

[[Page 22145]]

    Collection identifier: FR LL.
    OMB control number: 7100-0380.
    General description of collection: Regulation LL--Savings and Loan 
Holding Companies (12 CFR part 238) requires certain large savings and 
loan holding companies (SLHCs) to submit a capital plan to the Board on 
an annual basis, request prior approval from the Board under certain 
circumstances before making a capital distribution, conduct company-run 
periodic stress tests, report the results of its company-run stress 
tests to the Board, publicly disclose a summary of the results of such 
stress tests, and comply with certain other reporting and recordkeeping 
requirements.
    Capital is central to a firm's ability to absorb unexpected losses 
and continue to lend to creditworthy businesses and consumers. The 
Board's capital planning requirements for large bank holding companies 
help to ensure that these firms have robust systems and processes that 
incorporate forward-looking projections of revenue and losses to 
monitor and maintain their internal capital adequacy. The Board's 
stress testing and stress capital buffer requirements help ensure that 
a firm can meet its obligations to creditors and other counterparties, 
as well as continue to serve as a financial intermediary through 
periods of financial and economic stress.
    Frequency: Ongoing, annual, biennial, or event-generated.
    Respondents: Foreign SLHCs with average total consolidated assets 
of greater than $250 billion and domestic covered SLHCs with average 
total consolidated assets of greater than $100 billion.
    Total estimated number of respondents: 1.
    Total estimated change in burden: 31.
    Total estimated annual burden hours: 14,430.\1\

including more detailed burden estimates, can be found in the OMB 
Supporting Statement posted at <a href="https://www.federalreserve.gov/apps/reportingforms/home/review">https://www.federalreserve.gov/apps/reportingforms/home/review</a>. On the page displayed at the link, you 
can find the OMB Supporting Statement by referencing the collection 
identifier, FR LL.
---------------------------------------------------------------------------

    Current actions: On September 28, 2023, the Board published a 
notice in the Federal Register (88 FR 66848) requesting public comment 
for 60 days on the extension, with revision, of the FR LL. The Board 
proposed to revise the FR LL to account for several reporting 
provisions and one recordkeeping provision which had not been 
previously cleared by the Board under the PRA. The comment period for 
this notice expired on November 27, 2023. The Board did not receive any 
comments. The revisions will be implemented as proposed.

    Board of Governors of the Federal Reserve System, March 26, 
2024.
Ann Misback,
Secretary of the Board.
