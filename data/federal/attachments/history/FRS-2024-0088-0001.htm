will consider all comments received from the public and other agencies.
    During the comment period for this proposal, a copy of the proposed 
PRA OMB submission, including the draft reporting form and 
instructions, supporting statement (which contains more detail about 
the information collection and burden estimates than this notice), and 
other documentation, will be made available on the Board's public

Request for Comment on Information Collection Proposal

    The Board invites public comment on the following information 
collection, which is being reviewed under authority delegated by the 
OMB under the PRA. Comments are invited on the following:
    a. Whether the proposed collection of information is necessary for 
the proper performance of the Board's functions, including whether the 
information has practical utility;
    b. The accuracy of the Board's estimate of the burden of the 
proposed information collection, including the validity of the 
methodology and assumptions used;
    c. Ways to enhance the quality, utility, and clarity of the 
information to be collected;
    d. Ways to minimize the burden of information collection on 
respondents, including through the use of automated collection 
techniques or other forms of information technology; and

maintenance, and purchase of services to provide information.
    At the end of the comment period, the comments and recommendations 
received will be analyzed to determine the extent to which the Board 
should modify the proposal.

    OMB control number: 7100-0350.

Wall Street Reform and Consumer Protection Act (Dodd-Frank Act)

determined pose a grave threat to financial stability. The FR YY 
information collection includes reporting, recordkeeping, and 
disclosure requirements contained in Regulation YY.
    Proposed revisions: The Board proposes to revise the FR YY to take 
into account existing provisions in Regulation YY that include 
information collections, but had not been included in previous 
clearances.
    Frequency: Quarterly, biennial, annual, and event-generated.
    Respondents: U.S. BHCs, domestic and foreign nonbank SIFIs, SMBs, 
FBOs, and U.S. IHCs.
    Total estimated number of respondents: 43.
    Total estimated change in burden: 2,578.
    Total estimated annual burden hours: 26,458.\1\
