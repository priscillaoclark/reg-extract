SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION: 
    Title: ``Copies of Crop and Market Information Reports,'' OMB 
Control No. 3038-0015. This is a request for an extension of a 
currently approved information collection.
    Abstract: The information collected pursuant to this rule, 17 CFR 
1.40, is in the public interest and is necessary for market 
surveillance. Manipulation of commodity futures prices is a violation 
of the Commodity Exchange Act (Act). Section 9(a)(2) of the Act (7 
U.S.C. 13(a)(2)) prohibits the dissemination of false or misleading or 
knowingly inaccurate reports that affect or tend to affect the prices 
of commodities. In order to facilitate the enforcement of this 
provision, Commission regulation 1.40 requires that members of an 
exchange and FCMs provide upon request copies of any report published 
or given general circulation which concerns crop or market information 
that affects or tends to affect the price of any commodity.
    An agency may not conduct or sponsor, and a person is not required 
to respond to, a collection of information unless it displays a 
currently valid OMB control number.\2\ On November 20, 2023, the 
Commission published in the Federal Register notice of the proposed 
extension of this information collection and provided 60 days for 
public comment on the proposed extension, 88 FR 80696 (``60-Day 
Notice''). The Commission did not receive any comments on the 60-Day 
Notice.

    \2\ 44 U.S.C. 3512, 5 CFR 1320.5(b)(2)(i) and 1320.8(b)(3)(vi). 
See also 46 FR 63035 (Dec. 30, 1981).
---------------------------------------------------------------------------

    Burden Statement: The respondents' burden for this collection is 
estimated to be as follows:
    Estimated Number of Respondents: 10.
    Estimated Average Burden Hours per Respondent: 0.17.
    Estimated Total Annual Burden Hours: 1.7 hours.\3\
---------------------------------------------------------------------------

    \3\ The estimated total annual burden hours remain unchanged 
from the 2018 and 2021 renewals.
---------------------------------------------------------------------------

    Frequency of Collection: On occasion.
    There are no capital costs or operating and maintenance costs 
associated with this collection.

(Authority: 44 U.S.C. 3501 et seq.)

    Dated: January 24, 2024.
Robert Sidman,
Deputy Secretary of the Commission.
