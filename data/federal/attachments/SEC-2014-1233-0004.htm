SECURITIES AND EXCHANGE COMMISSION

[SEC File No. 270-185, OMB Control No. 3235-0238]


Proposed Collection; Comment Request; Extension: Form N-6F

Upon Written Request, Copies Available From: Securities and Exchange 
Commission, Office of FOIA Services, 100 F Street NE, Washington, DC 
20549-2736.

    Notice is hereby given that, pursuant to the Paperwork Reduction 
Act of 1995 (44 U.S.C. 3501 et seq.) the Securities and Exchange 
Commission (the ``Commission'') is soliciting comments on the 
collection of information summarized below. The Commission plans to 
submit this existing collection of information to the Office of 
Management and Budget for extension and approval.
    The title for the collection of information is ``Form N-6F (17 CFR 
274.15), Notice of Intent to Elect to be Subject to Sections 55 through 
65 of the Investment Company Act of 1940.'' The purpose of Form N-6F is 
to notify the Commission of a company's intent to file a notification 
of election to become subject to Sections 55 through 65 of the 
Investment Company Act of 1940 (15 U.S.C. 80a-1 et seq.) (``1940 
Act''). Certain companies may have to make a filing with the Commission 
before they are ready to elect to be regulated as a business 
development company.\1\ A company that is excluded from the definition 
of ``investment company'' by Section 3(c)(1) because it has fewer than 
one hundred shareholders and is not making a public offering of its 
securities may lose such an exclusion solely because it proposes to 
make a public offering of securities as a business development company. 
Such company, under certain conditions, would not lose its exclusion if 
it notifies the Commission on Form N-6F of its intent to make an 
election to be regulated as a business development company. The company 
only has to file a Form N-6F once.
---------------------------------------------------------------------------

    \1\ A company might not be prepared to elect to be subject to 
Sections 55 through 65 of the 1940 Act because its capital structure 
or management compensation plan is not yet in compliance with the 
requirements of those sections.
---------------------------------------------------------------------------

    The Commission estimates that on average approximately 9 companies 
file these notifications each year. Each of those companies need only 
make a single filing of Form N-6F. The Commission further estimates 
that this information collection imposes burden of 0.5 hours, resulting 
in a total annual

[[Page 80365]]

PRA burden of 4.5 hours. Based on the estimated wage rate, the total 
cost to the industry of the hour burden for complying with Form N-6F 
would be approximately $1,912.50.
    The collection of information under Form N-6F is mandatory. The 
information provided under the form is not kept confidential. An agency 
may not conduct or sponsor, and a person is not required to respond to, 
a collection of information unless it displays a currently valid OMB 
control number.
    Written comments are invited on: (a) whether the proposed 
collection of information is necessary for the proper performance of 
the functions of the Commission, including whether the information 
shall have practical utility; (b) the accuracy of the Commission's 
estimate of the burden of the collection of information; (c) ways to 
enhance the quality, utility, and clarity of the information collected; 
and (d) ways to minimize the burden of the collection of information on 
respondents, including through the use of automated collection 
techniques or other forms of information technology. Consideration will 
be given to comments and suggestions submitted by January 16, 2024.
    An agency may not conduct or sponsor, and a person is not required 
to respond to, a collection of information under the PRA unless it 
displays a currently valid OMB control number.
    Please direct your written comments to: David Bottom, Acting 
Director/Chief Information Officer, Securities and Exchange Commission, 
c/o John Pezzullo, 100 F Street NE, Washington, DC 20549 or send an 
email to: <a href="/cdn-cgi/l/email-protection#edbdbfacb2a08c84818f8295ad9e888ec38a829b"><span class="__cf_email__" data-cfemail="b8e8eaf9e7f5d9d1d4dad7c0f8cbdddb96dfd7ce">[email&#160;protected]</span></a>.

    Dated: November 14, 2023.
Sherry R. Haywood,
Assistant Secretary.
