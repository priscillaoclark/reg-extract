[SEC File No. 270-346, OMB Control No. 3235-0392]


Submission for OMB Review; Comment Request; Extension: Rule 15g-3

Upon Written Request, Copies Available From: Securities and Exchange 
Commission, Office of FOIA Services, 100 F Street NE, Washington, DC 
20549-2736

    Notice is hereby given that pursuant to the Paperwork Reduction Act 
of 1995 (''PRA'') (44 U.S.C. 3501 et seq.), the Securities and Exchange 
Commission (``Commission'') has submitted to the Office of Management 
and Budget (``OMB'') a request for approval of extension of the 
existing collection of information provided for in Rule 15g-3--Broker 
or dealer disclosure of quotations and other information relating to 
the penny stock market (17 CFR 240.15g-3) under the Securities Exchange 
Act of 1934 (15 U.S.C. 78a et seq.).
    Rule 15g-3 requires that brokers and dealers disclose to customers 
current quotation prices or similar market information in connection 
with transactions in penny stocks. The purpose of the rule is to 
increase the level of disclosure to investors concerning penny stocks 
generally and specific penny stock transactions.
    The Commission estimates that approximately 170 broker-dealers will 
each spend an average of approximately 87.0833333 hours annually to 
comply with this rule. Thus, the total time

[[Page 60672]]

burden is approximately 14,804 hours per year.
    Rule 15g-3 contains record retention requirements. Compliance with 
the rule is mandatory. The required records are available only to the 
examination staff of the Commission and the self regulatory 
organizations of which the broker-dealer is a member.
    An agency may not conduct or sponsor, and a person is not required 
to respond to, a collection of information under the PRA unless it 
displays a currently valid OMB control number.
    The public may view background documentation for this information 
collection at the following website: <a href="http://www.reginfo.gov">www.reginfo.gov</a>. Find this
