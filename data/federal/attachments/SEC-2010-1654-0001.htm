    \1\ 15 U.S.C. 78k-1(a)(3).
    \2\ 17 CFR 242.608.
    \3\ On July 6, 2001, the Commission approved the OLPP, which was 
proposed by the American Stock Exchange LLC (``Amex''), Chicago 
Board Options Exchange, Incorporated (``CBOE''), International 
Securities Exchange LLC (``ISE''), Options Clearing Corporation 
(``OCC''), Philadelphia Stock Exchange, Inc. (``Phlx''), and Pacific

---------------------------------------------------------------------------

I. Description and Purpose of the Amendment

    The current Sponsors of the OLPP are BATS, BOX, CBOE, ISE, NYSE 
Amex, NYSE Arca, OCC, Phlx and Nasdaq. The proposed amendment to the 
OLPP would add C2 as a Sponsor of the OLPP. A national securities 
exchange may become a Sponsor if it satisfies the requirement of 
Section 7 of the OLPP. Specifically an Eligible Exchange \4\ may become 
a Sponsor of the OLPP by: (i) Executing a copy of the OLPP, as then in 
effect; (ii) providing each current Plan Sponsor with a copy of such 
executed Plan; and (iii) effecting an amendment to the OLPP, as 
specified in Section 7(ii) of the OLPP.
---------------------------------------------------------------------------

    \4\ The OLPP defines an ``Eligible Exchange'' as a national 
securities exchange registered with the Commission pursuant to 
Section 6(a) of the Exchange Act, 15 U.S.C. 78f(a), that (1) has 
effective rules for the trading of options contracts issued and 
cleared by the OCC approved in accordance with the provisions of the 
Exchange Act and the rules and regulations thereunder and (2) is a 
party to the Plan for Reporting Consolidated Options Last Sale 
Reports and Quotation Information (the ``OPRA Plan''). C2 has 
represented that it has met both the requirements for being 
considered an Eligible Exchange.
---------------------------------------------------------------------------

    Section 7(ii) of the OLPP sets forth the process by which an 
Eligible Exchange may effect an amendment to the OLPP. Specifically, an 
Eligible Exchange must: (a) Execute a copy of the OLPP with the only 
change being the addition of the new sponsor's name in Section 8 of the 
OLPP; and (b) submit the executed OLPP to the Commission. The OLPP then 
provides that such an amendment will be effective at the later of 
either the amendment being approved by the Commission or otherwise 
becoming effective pursuant to Section 11A of the Act. C2 has submitted 
a signed copy of the OLPP to the Commission in accordance with the 
procedures set forth in the OLPP regarding new Plan Sponsors.

II. Effectiveness of the Proposed Linkage Plan Amendment

    The foregoing proposed OLPP amendment has become effective pursuant 
to Rule 608(c)(3)(iii) \5\ because it involves solely technical or 
ministerial matters. At any time within sixty days of the filing of 
this amendment, the Commission may summarily abrogate the amendment and 
require that it be refiled pursuant to paragraphs (b)(1) of Rule 
608,\6\ if it appears to the Commission that such action is necessary 
or appropriate in the public interest, for the protection of investors 
or the maintenance of fair and orderly markets, to remove impediments 
to, and perfect the mechanisms of, a national market system or 
otherwise in furtherance of the purposes of the Act.
