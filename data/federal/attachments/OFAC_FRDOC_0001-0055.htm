DEPARTMENT OF THE TREASURY

Proposed Collection; Comment Request for Electronic License 
Application Form

AGENCY: Office of Foreign Assets Control, Treasury.

ACTION: Notice and request for comments.

-----------------------------------------------------------------------

SUMMARY: The Department of the Treasury, as part of its continuing 
effort to reduce paperwork and respondent burden, invites the general 
public and other Federal agencies to comment on proposed and/or 
continuing information collections, as required by the Paperwork 
Reduction Act of 1995, Public Law 104-13 (44 U.S.C. 3506(c)(2)(A)). 
Currently, the Office of Foreign Assets Control (``OFAC'') within the 
Department of the Treasury is soliciting comments concerning OFAC's 
Electronic License Application Form TD-F 90-22.54.

DATES: Written comments should be received on or before June 22, 2009, 
to be assured of consideration.

ADDRESSES: Direct all written comments to ``Paperwork Reduction Act'' 
care of the Policy Division, Office of Foreign Assets Control, 
Department of the Treasury, 1500 Pennsylvania Avenue, NW., Annex--4th 
Floor, Washington, DC 20220.

FOR FURTHER INFORMATION CONTACT: Requests for additional information 
about the filings or procedures should be directed to the Assistant 
Director for Policy, tel.: 202/622-4855, Office of Foreign Assets 
Control, Department of the Treasury, 1500 Pennsylvania Avenue, NW.,

SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION:
    Title: OFAC Application for the Release of Blocked Funds.
    Agency Form Number: TD-F 90-22.54.
    OMB Number: 1505-0170.
    Abstract: Transactions prohibited pursuant to the Trading With the 
Enemy Act, 50 U.S.C. App. 1-44, the International Emergency Economic 
Powers Act, 50 U.S.C. 1701 et seq., and similar authorities may be 
authorized by means of specific licenses issued by the Office of 
Foreign Assets Control (``OFAC''). Such licenses are issued in response 
to applications submitted by persons or institutions whose property or 
interests in property have been blocked or who wish to engage in 
transactions that would otherwise be prohibited. Form TD-F 90-22.54, 
which provides a standardized method of application for all applicants 
seeking the unblocking of funds transfers, is available in electronic 
format on OFAC's Web site. Use of the form greatly facilitates and 
speeds these applicants' submissions and OFAC's processing of such 
applications while simultaneously obviating the need for applicants to 
write lengthy letters to OFAC, thus reducing the overall burden of the 
application process. Since February 2000, use of the form to apply for 
the unblocking of funds transfers has been mandatory pursuant to a 
revision in OFAC's regulations at 31 CFR 501.801. See 65 FR 10708, 
February 29, 2000.
    Current Actions: There are no changes being made to the form at 
this time.
    Type of Review: Extension of a currently approved collection.
    Affected Public: Individuals/businesses and other for-profit 
institutions/banking institutions.
    Estimated Number of Respondents: 3,000.
    Estimated Time per Respondent: 30 minutes.
    Estimated Total Annual Burden Hours: 1,500.
    The following paragraph applies to all of the collections of 
information covered by this notice:
    An agency may not conduct or sponsor, and a person is not required 
to respond to, a collection of information unless the collection of 
information displays a valid Office of Management and Budget (``OMB'') 
control number. Books or records relating to a collection of 
information must be retained for five years.

Request for Comments

    Comments submitted in response to this notice will be summarized 
and/or included in the request for OMB approval. All comments will 
become a matter of public record. Comments are invited on: (a) Whether 
the collection of information is necessary for the proper performance 
of the functions of the agency, including whether the information has 
practical utility; (b) the accuracy of the agency's estimate of the 
burden of the collection of information; (c) ways to enhance the 
quality, utility, and clarity of the information to be collected; (d) 
ways to minimize the

[[Page 18283]]

burden of the collection of information on respondents, including 
through the use of automated collection techniques or other forms of 
information technology; and (e) estimates of capital or start-up costs 
and costs of operation, maintenance, and purchase of services to 
provide information.

    Approved: April 13, 2009.
Adam J. Szubin,
Director, Office of Foreign Assets Control.
