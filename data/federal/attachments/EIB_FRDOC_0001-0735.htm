SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION: As required by Export-Import Bank Act of 
1945 (see section 8A(a)(1) of EXIM's charter), EXIM will survey U.S. 
exporters and commercial lending institutions to understand their 
experience with EXIM ``meeting financial competition from other 
countries whose exporters compete with United States exporters.'' EXIM 
plans to survey exporters and lenders that have engaged with EXIM on 
medium- and long-term support over the previous calendar year or 
responded to at least one of EXIM's last two surveys. The potential 
respondents will be sent an electronic invitation to participate in the 
online survey.
    The proposed survey will ask participants about their potential or 
completed deals involving EXIM, their opinion of EXIM's policies and 
procedures, their interaction and perceptions of other export credit 
agencies, and impacts of overall market conditions on their businesses.
    The survey can be reviewed at: <a href="https://img.exim.gov/s3fs-public/EXIM+Competitiveness+Report+Exporter+and+Lender+Survey+2023.pdf">https://img.exim.gov/s3fs-public/EXIM+Competitiveness+Report+Exporter+and+Lender+Survey+2023.pdf</a>.
