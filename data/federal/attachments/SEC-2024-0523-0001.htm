II. Clearing Agency's Statement of the Purpose of, and Statutory Basis 
for, the Proposed Rule Change

    In its filing with the Commission, OCC included statements 
concerning the purpose of and basis for the proposed rule change and 
discussed any comments it received on the proposed rule change. The 
text of these statements may be examined at the places specified in 
Item IV below. OCC has prepared summaries, set forth in sections (A), 
(B), and (C) below, of the most significant aspects of these 
statements.

(A) Clearing Agency's Statement of the Purpose of, and Statutory Basis 
for, the Proposed Rule Change

(1) Purpose
    The purpose of this proposed rule change is to revise OCC's 
schedule of fees to update the maximum aggregate Operational Loss Fee 
that OCC would charge Clearing Members in equal shares in the unlikely 
event that OCC's shareholders' equity (``Equity'') falls below certain 
thresholds defined in OCC's Capital Management Policy.
    The proposed fee change is designed to enable OCC to replenish 
capital to comply with Rule 17Ad-22(e)(15) under the Exchange Act, 
which requires OCC,

[[Page 27819]]

in pertinent part, to ``hold[ ] liquid net assets funded by equity 
equal to the greater of either (x) six months . . . current operating 
expenses, or (y) the amount determined by the board of directors to be 
sufficient to ensure a recovery or orderly wind-down of critical 
operations and service'' \6\ and ``[m]aintain[ ] a viable plan, 
approved by the board of directors and updated at least annually, for 
raising additional equity should its equity fall close to or below the 
amount required.'' \7\ The proposed rule change would implement a 
change in the maximum contingent Operational Loss Fee listed in OCC's 
schedule of fees in accordance with OCC's Capital Management Policy.
---------------------------------------------------------------------------

    \6\ See 17 CFR 240.17Ad-22(e)(15)(ii).
    \7\ See 17 CFR 240.17Ad-22(e)(15)(iii).
---------------------------------------------------------------------------

    OCC's Capital Management Policy includes OCC's replenishment 
plan.\8\ Pursuant to the Capital Management Policy, OCC would charge an 
Operational Loss Fee in equal shares to Clearing Members to raise 
additional capital should OCC's Equity, less the Minimum Corporate 
Contribution,\9\ fall below certain defined thresholds relative to 
OCC's Target Capital Requirement (i.e., a ``Trigger Event''), after 
first applying the unvested balance held in respect of OCC's Executive 
Deferred Compensation Program.\10\ Specifically, a Trigger Event is 
when Equity less the Minimum Corporate Contribution: (i) remains below 
the Target Capital Requirement for 90 consecutive calendar days; or 
(ii) falls below 90% of the Target Capital Requirement. Based on the 
Board-approved Target Capital Requirement for 2024 of $274 million, a 
Trigger Event would occur if OCC's Equity less the Minimum Corporate 
Contribution falls below $246.6 million at any time or below $274 
million for a period of 90 consecutive calendar days.
---------------------------------------------------------------------------

    \8\ See Exchange Act Release No. 88029 (Jan. 24, 2020), 85 FR 
5500 (Jan. 30, 2020) (File No. SR-OCC-2019-007) (``Order Approving 
OCC's Capital Management Policy'').
    \9\ The Minimum Corporate Contribution is defined in the Capital 
Management Policy as the minimum level of OCC's own funds maintained 
exclusively to cover credit losses or liquidity shortfalls, the 
level of which the OCC's Board of Directors (``Board'') shall 
determine from time to time. See Exchange Act Release No. 92038 (May 
27, 2021), 86 FR 29861, 29862 (June 3, 2021) (File No. SR-OCC-2021-
003). For 2024, the Board has approved a Minimum Corporate 
Contribution of $61 million. When combined with the unvested funds 
held in respect of OCC's Executive Deferred Compensation Plan 
contributed after January 1, 2020 (the ``EDCP Unvested Balance,'' as 
defined in OCC's Rules), OCC's persistent minimum level of skin-in-
the-game for 2024 would be $69 million, or 25% of OCC's Target 
Capital Requirement. In addition to this minimum level, OCC would 
also contribute liquid net assets funded by equity greater than 110% 
of the Target Capital Requirement. See OCC Rule 1006(e).
    \10\ See Exchange Act Release No. 91199 (Feb. 24, 2021), 86 FR 
12237, 12241 (Mar. 2, 2021) (File No. SR-OCC-2021-003) (amending 
OCC's replenishment plan, including the measurement for a Trigger 
Event, to account for the establishment of OCC's persistent minimum 
skin-in-the-game).
---------------------------------------------------------------------------

    In the unlikely event those thresholds are breached, OCC would 
charge an Operational Loss Fee in an amount to raise Equity to 110% of 
OCC's Target Capital Requirement, up to the maximum Operational Loss 
Fee identified in OCC's schedule of fees less the amount of any 
Operational Loss Fees previously charged and not refunded.\11\ OCC 
calculates the maximum aggregate Operational Loss Fee based on the 
amount determined by the Board to be sufficient for a recovery or 
orderly wind-down of critical operations and services (``RWD 
Amount''),\12\ which is determined based on the assumptions in OCC's 
Recovery and Orderly Wind-Down Plan (``RWD Plan'').\13\ In order to 
account for OCC's tax liability for retaining the Operational Loss Fee 
as earnings, OCC may apply a tax gross-up to the RWD Amount (``Adjusted 
RWD Amount'') depending on whether the operational loss that caused 
OCC's Equity to fall below the Trigger Event thresholds is tax 
deductible.\14\
---------------------------------------------------------------------------

    \11\ See Order Approving OCC's Capital Management Policy, 85 FR 
at 5503.
    \12\ Id.
    \13\ The RWD Plan states OCC's basic assumptions concerning the 
resolution process, including assumptions about the duration of the 
resolution process, the cost of the resolution process, OCC's 
capitalization through the resolution process, the maintenance of 
Critical Services and Critical Support Functions, as defined by the 
RWD Plan, and the retention of personnel and contractual 
relationships. See Exchange Act Release No. 83918 (Aug. 23, 2018), 
83 FR 44091, 44094, 44096 (Aug. 29, 2018) (File No. SR-OCC-2017-
021).
    \14\ See Order Approving OCC's Capital Management Policy, 85 FR 
at 5503.
---------------------------------------------------------------------------

    The RWD Amount and, in turn, the Adjusted RWD Amount are determined 
annually based on OCC's corporate budget, the assumptions articulated 
in the RWD Plan, and OCC's projected effective tax rate.\15\ The 
current Operational Loss Fee listed in OCC's schedule of fees is the 
Adjusted RWD Amount calculated based on OCC's 2023 corporate budget. 
Budgeted operating expenses in 2024 are higher than the 2023 budgeted 
operating expenses. This proposed rule change would revise the maximum 
Operational Loss Fee to reflect the Adjusted RWD Amount based on OCC's 
2024 budget,\16\ as follows:
---------------------------------------------------------------------------

    \15\ See Order Approving OCC's Capital Management Policy, 85 FR 
at 5501 n.20, 5503.
    \16\ Confidential data and analysis evidencing the calculation 
of the Adjusted RWD Amount based on OCC's 2024 corporate budget is 
included in Exhibit 3 to File Number SR-OCC-2024-004.

------------------------------------------------------------------------
           Current fee schedule                 Proposed fee schedule
------------------------------------------------------------------------
$174,000,000.00 less the aggregate amount   $182,000,000.00 less the
 of Operational Loss Fees previously         aggregate amount of
 charged and not refunded as of the date     Operational Loss Fees
 calculated, divided by the number of        previously charged and not
 Clearing Members at the time charged.       refunded as of the date
                                             calculated, divided by the
                                             number of Clearing Members
                                             at the time charged.
------------------------------------------------------------------------

    Since the allocation of the Operational Loss Fee is a function of 
the number of Clearing Members at the time of the charge, the maximum 
Operational Loss Fee per Clearing Member is subject to fluctuation 
during the course of the year. However, if the proposed Operational 
Loss Fee were charged to 103 Clearing Members, the number of Clearing 
Members as of December 13, 2023, for example, the maximum Operational 
Loss Fee per Clearing Member would be $1,766,990.
    OCC would also update the schedule of fees to reflect the levels of 
Equity at which OCC would charge the Operational Loss Fee according to 
the thresholds defined in the Capital Management Policy, as well as the 
level of Equity at which OCC would limit the Operational Loss Fee 
charged, based on OCC's current Target Capital Requirement.\17\ 
Consistent with OCC's approach to its persistent minimum skin-in-the-
game, the threshold in the schedule of fees continues to reflect that 
consistent with OCC's Capital Management Policy, the Trigger Event 
threshold is measured against Equity less the Minimum Corporate 
Contribution. For additional clarity, OCC proposes to specify that it 
would charge the Operational Loss Fee after

[[Page 27820]]

contributing the EDCP Unvested Balance.\18\ This addition would not 
change current practices and is intended to more closely align the 
language in the fee schedule with the language in OCC's Capital 
Management Policy.\19\
---------------------------------------------------------------------------

    \17\ OCC does not propose any change to the thresholds and 
limits defined in the Capital Management Policy. This proposed 
change merely conforms the disclosure in OCC's schedule of fees to 
the current amounts based on the Board-approved Target Capital 
Requirement of $274 million.
    \18\ OCC Rule 101 defines the term ``EDCP Unvested Balance'' to 
mean, as of any date, the funds heldunder The Options Clearing 
Corporation Executive Deferred Compensation Plan Trust which are (a) 
deposited on and after January 1, 2020 in respect of OCC's Executive 
Deferred Compensation Plan (the ``EDCP'') and (b) in excess of 
amounts necessary to pay for the benefits accrued and vested under 
the EDCP as of such date.
    \19\ The Capital Management Policy states that, in the event of 
a Trigger Event, OCC shall contribute the fundsnecessary to cure 
such loss with the EDCP Unvested Balance. If OCC's Equity remains 
below 90% of the Target Capital Requirement after applying the EDCP 
Unvested Balance or if a further Trigger Event occurs after applying 
all available EDCP Unvested Balance, OCC shall charge an Operational 
Loss Fee in equal share to each Clearing Member, payable within five 
business days. See supra note 8 at 5503.
---------------------------------------------------------------------------

    OCC proposes the fee change to be effective immediately upon 
filing, because the Board approved the Adjusted RWD Amount upon which 
the Operational Loss Fee is based for 2024. Notwithstanding the 
immediate effectiveness, OCC would not make the fee change operative 
until after the time required to self-certify the proposed change with 
the Commodity Futures Trading Commission (``CFTC'').
(2) Statutory Basis
    OCC believes the proposed rule change is consistent with the Act 
\20\ and the rules and regulations thereunder. In particular, OCC 
believes that the proposed fee change is also consistent with Section 
17A(b)(3)(D) of the Act,\21\ which requires that the rules of a 
clearing agency provide for the equitable allocation of reasonable 
dues, fees, and other charges among its participants. OCC believes that 
the proposed fee change is reasonable because it is designed to 
replenish OCC's Equity in the form of liquid net assets as a component 
of OCC's plan to replenish its capital in the event that OCC's Equity, 
less the Minimum Corporate Contribution reserved as the primary portion 
of OCC's minimum persistent skin-in-the-game, falls close to or below 
its Target Capital Requirement so that OCC can continue to meet its 
obligations as a systemically important financial market utility 
(``SIFMU'') to Clearing Members and the general public should 
operational losses materialize (including through a recovery or orderly 
wind-down of critical operations and services) and thereby facilitate 
compliance with Rule 17Ad-22(e)(15)(iii).\22\ The maximum Operational 
Loss Fee is sized to ensure that OCC maintains sufficient liquid net 
assets to support its RWD Plan and imposes a contingent obligation on 
Clearing Members that is similar to a Clearing Member's contingent 
obligation for Clearing Fund assessments for a Clearing Member 
operating at the minimum Clearing Fund deposit.\23\ OCC thus believes 
the proposed maximum Operational Loss Fee sized to OCC's Adjusted RWD 
Amount is reasonable.
---------------------------------------------------------------------------

    \21\ 15 U.S.C. 78q-1(b)(3)(D).
    \22\ 17 CFR 240.17Ad-22(e)(15)(iii).
    \23\ A Clearing Member operating at the minimum Clearing Fund 
deposit ($500,000) could be assessed up to an additional $1 million 
(the minimum deposit, assessed up to two times), for a total 
contingent obligation of $1.5 million. See OCC Rule 1006(h).
---------------------------------------------------------------------------

    OCC also believes that the proposed Operational Loss Fee would 
result in an equitable allocation of fees among its participants 
because it would be equally applicable to all Clearing Members. As the 
Commission has recognized, OCC's designation as a SIFMU and its role as 
the sole covered clearing agency for all listed options contracts in 
the U.S. makes it an integral part of the national system for clearance 
and settlement, through which ``Clearing Members, their customers, 
investors, and the markets as a whole derive significant benefit . . . 
regardless of their specific utilization of that system.'' \24\ Neither 
the SEC nor OCC is aware of a positive correlation between measures of 
Clearing Member utilization and OCC's benefit to Clearing Members \25\ 
or its risk of operational loss.\26\ As a result, OCC believes that the 
proposed change to OCC's fee schedule provides for the equitable 
allocation of reasonable fees in accordance with Section 17A(b)(3)(D) 
of the Act.\27\
---------------------------------------------------------------------------

    \24\ See Order Approving OCC's Capital Management Policy, 85 FR 
at 5506.
    \25\ Id. (``The Commission is not aware of evidence 
demonstrating that those benefits are tied directly or positively 
correlated to an individual Clearing Member's rate of utilization of 
OCC's clearance and settlement services.'')
    \26\ Id. (rejecting an objection to the equal allocation of the 
proposed Operational Loss Fee based on the SEC's regulatory 
experience and OCC's analyses of Clearing Member utilization (e.g., 
contract volume) or credit risk (e.g., Clearing Fund size) and the 
various operational and general business risks that could trigger an 
Operational Loss Fee). To date, OCC has observed no correlation 
between Clearing Member utilization or credit risk and OCC's 
potential risk of operational loss. See Confidential Exhibit 3 [sic] 
demonstrating that operational risks may arise from a variety of 
sources that are represented in different ways.
    \27\ 15 U.S.C. 78q-1(b)(3)(D).
---------------------------------------------------------------------------

    In addition, OCC believes that the proposed rule change is 
consistent with Rule 17Ad-22(e)(15)(iii), which requires that OCC 
establish, implement, maintain and enforce written policies and 
procedures reasonably designed to identify, monitor, and manage OCC's 
general business risk, including by maintaining a viable plan, approved 
by the Board and updated at least annually, for raising additional 
equity should its equity fall close to or below the amount required 
under Rule 17Ad-22(e)(15)(ii).\28\ While Rule 17Ad-22(e)(15)(iii) does 
not by its terms specify the amount of additional equity a clearing 
agency's plan for replenishment capital must be designed to raise, the 
SEC's adopting release states that ``a viable plan generally should 
enable the covered clearing agency to hold sufficient liquid net assets 
to achieve recovery or orderly wind-down.'' \29\ OCC sets the maximum 
Operational Loss Fee at an amount sufficient to raise, on a post-tax 
basis, the amount determined annually by the Board to be sufficient to 
ensure recovery or orderly wind-down pursuant to the RWD Plan.\30\ 
Therefore, OCC believes the proposed change to the Operational Loss Fee 
in OCC's schedule of fees is consistent with Rule 17Ad-22(e)(15)(iii) 
and the guidance provided by the SEC in the adopting release.

Release No. 78961 (Sept. 28, 2016), 81 FR 70786, 70836 (Oct. 13, 
2016) (File No. S7-03-14).
    \30\ See Order Approving OCC's Capital Management Policy, 85 FR 
at 5510 (``The Operational Loss Fee would be sized to the Adjusted 
RWD Amount, and therefore would be designed to provide OCC with at 
least enough capital either to continue as a going concern or to 
wind-down in an orderly fashion.'').
---------------------------------------------------------------------------

    OCC also believes that the proposed fee change is consistent with 
Section 19(g)(1) of the Act,\31\ which, among other things, requires 
every self-regulatory organization to comply with its own rules. OCC 
filed its Capital Management Policy as a ``proposed rule change'' 
within the meaning of Section 19(b) of the Act,\32\ and Rule 19b-4 
under the Act.\33\ The Capital Management Policy specifies that the 
maximum Operational Loss Fee shall be the Adjusted RWD Amount.\34\ 
Because the Adjusted RWD Amount will change annually based, in part, on 
OCC's corporate budget, fee filings are necessary to ensure that the 
maximum Operational Loss Fee in OCC's schedule of fees remains 
consistent with the amount identified in the Capital Management Policy. 
In addition, the amounts associated with the thresholds at which OCC 
would charge the Operational Loss Fee and the limit to the amount that 
would change in

[[Page 27821]]

accordance with the Capital Management Policy are determined based upon 
the level at which the Board sets OCC's Target Capital Requirement. 
Consequently, OCC seeks to amend the amounts identified in the schedule 
of fees to reflect OCC's current Target Capital Requirement and OCC's 
current Capital Management Policy, which reflects the establishment of 
the Minimum Corporate Contribution.\35\ OCC also proposes revisions to 
more closely align the language in the fee schedule with the language 
in OCC's Capital Management Policy to promote clarity in the fee 
schedule. Therefore, OCC believes that the proposed change to OCC's fee 
schedule is consistent with Section 19(g)(1) of the Act.\36\

---------------------------------------------------------------------------

(B) Clearing Agency's Statement on Burden on Competition

    Section 17A(b)(3)(I) of the Act \37\ requires that the rules of a 
clearing agency not impose any burden on competition not necessary or 
appropriate in furtherance of the purposes of the Act. OCC does not 
believe that the proposed rule change would have any impact or impose a 
burden on competition. Although the proposed Operational Loss Fee 
affects Clearing Members, their customers, and the markets that OCC 
serves, OCC believes that the proposed increase in the Operational Loss 
Fee would not disadvantage or favor any particular user of OCC's 
services in relationship to another user because the proposed 
Operational Loss Fee would apply equally to all Clearing Members. In 
addition, OCC does not believe that the proposed Operational Loss Fee 
imposes a significant burden on smaller firms because the maximum 
Operational Loss Fee imposes a contingent obligation on Clearing 
Members that is similar to a Clearing Member's contingent obligation 
for Clearing Fund assessments for a Clearing Member operating at the 
minimum Clearing Fund deposit.\38\ Accordingly, OCC does not believe 
that the proposed rule change would have any impact or impose a burden 
on competition.

III. Date of Effectiveness of the Proposed Rule Change and Timing for 
Commission Action

    Pursuant to Section 19(b)(3)(A)(ii) \39\ of the Act, and Rule 19b-
4(f)(2) thereunder,\40\ the proposed rule change is filed for immediate 
effectiveness as it constitutes a change in fees charged to OCC 
Clearing Members. At any time within 60 days of the filing of the 
proposed rule change, the Commission summarily may temporarily suspend 
such rule change if it appears to the Commission that such action is 
necessary or appropriate in the public interest, for the protection of 
investors, or otherwise in furtherance of the purposes of the Act. The 
proposal shall not take effect until all regulatory actions required 
with respect to the proposal are completed.\41\
