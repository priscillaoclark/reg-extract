SECURITIES AND EXCHANGE COMMISSION

[SEC File No. 270-205, OMB Control No. 3235-0194]


Submission for OMB Review; Comment Request; Extension: Rule 24b-1

Upon Written Request, Copies Available From: Securities and Exchange 
Commission, Office of FOIA Services, 100 F Street NE, Washington, DC 
20549-2736

    Notice is hereby given that pursuant to the Paperwork Reduction Act 
of 1995 (``PRA'') (44 U.S.C. 3501 et seq.), the Securities and Exchange 
Commission (``Commission'') has submitted to the Office of Management 
and Budget (``OMB'') a request for approval of extension of the 
previously approved collection of information provided for in Rule 24b-
1 (17 CFR 240.24b-1) under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 (15 
U.S.C. 78a et seq.).
    Rule 24b-1 requires a national securities exchange to keep and make 
available for public inspection a copy of its registration statement 
and exhibits filed with the Commission, including any amendments 
thereto.
    There are 24 national securities exchanges that spend approximately 
one-half hour each per year complying with this rule, for an aggregate 
total time burden of approximately 12 hours per year. The staff 
estimates that the average cost per respondent is approximately $82.45 
per year ($17.67 for copying plus $64.78 for storage), resulting in a 
total cost burden for all respondents of approximately $1,979 per year.
    An agency may not conduct or sponsor, and a person is not required 
to respond to, a collection of information under the PRA unless it 
displays a currently valid OMB control number.
    The public may view background documentation for this information 
collection at the following website: <a href="http://www.reginfo.gov">www.reginfo.gov</a>. Find this 
particular information collection by selecting ``Currently under 30-day 
Review--Open for Public Comments'' or by using the search function. 
Written comments and recommendations for the proposed information 
collection should be sent by August 29, 2024 to (i) <a href="http://www.reginfo.gov/public/do/PRAMain">www.reginfo.gov/public/do/PRAMain</a> and (ii) Austin Gerig, Director/Chief Data Officer, 
Securities and Exchange Commission, c/o Oluwaseun Ajayi, 100 F Street 
NE, Washington, DC 20549, or by sending an email to:

Sherry R. Haywood,
Assistant Secretary.
