SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION: 

I. Background

A. Proposed Definition of Military Installation and Appendix A

    On May 5, 2023, the U.S. Department of the Treasury (Treasury 
Department) published in the Federal Register a proposed rule (88 FR 
29003) amending the definition of ``military installation'' and adding 
eight military installations to the list at appendix A of the 
regulations in part 802 to title 31 of the Code of Federal Regulations 
(part 802) that implement the provisions relating to real estate 
transactions pursuant to section 721 of the Defense Production Act of 
1950, as amended (section 721). Part 802 sets forth the processes and 
procedures of the Committee on Foreign Investment in the United States 
(CFIUS) for reviewing transactions involving the purchase or lease by, 
or concession to, a foreign person of certain real estate in the United 
States. Appendix A identifies, among other things, the bases, ranges, 
and other installations

[[Page 57349]]

that meet the definition of ``military installation'' at Sec.  802.227. 
The amendments were proposed as a result of the ongoing evaluation of 
military installations by the U.S. Department of Defense (Defense 
Department).

B. Additional Technical Amendments To Update the Names of Certain 
Military Installations

    This final rule also includes technical amendments to update the 
names of five military installations at appendix A: Fort Cavazos 
(formerly Fort Hood); Fort Gregg-Adams (formerly Fort Lee); Fort 
Johnson (formerly Fort Polk); Fort Liberty (formerly Fort Bragg); and 
Fort Moore (formerly Fort Benning). These are name changes to 
installations already on the list at appendix A and reflect decisions 
made by the Defense Department to implement the recommendations of the 
Defense Department Naming Commission. The military installation name 
changes in this final rule are those that have officially been changed 
by the Defense Department as of the publication date of this rule in 
the Federal Register. Additional bases may be renamed in the future, 
and information on the full list of recommended name changes is 
available at <a href="https://media.defense.gov/2022/Oct/06/2003092544/-1/-1/1/IMPLEMENTATION-OF-THE-NAMING-COMMISSIONS-RECOMMENDATIONS.PDF">https://media.defense.gov/2022/Oct/06/2003092544/-1/-1/1/IMPLEMENTATION-OF-THE-NAMING-COMMISSIONS-RECOMMENDATIONS.PDF</a> and 
<a href="https://www.defense.gov/News/News-Stories/Article/Article/3260434/dod-begins-implementing-naming-commission-recommendations/">https://www.defense.gov/News/News-Stories/Article/Article/3260434/dod-begins-implementing-naming-commission-recommendations/</a>.

C. Additional Guidance

    The Treasury Department, in coordination with the Defense 
Department and the U.S. Department of Commerce's Census Bureau (Census 
Bureau), makes available a web-based tool to help the public understand 
the geographic coverage of part 802. This web-based tool is available 
at <a href="https://mtgis-portal.geo.census.gov/arcgis/apps/webappviewer/index.html?id=0bb1d5751d76498181b4b531987ce263">https://mtgis-portal.geo.census.gov/arcgis/apps/webappviewer/index.html?id=0bb1d5751d76498181b4b531987ce263</a> and allows users to 
input an address and determine the distance to certain military 
installations. The tool was developed to assist the public and is 
provided for reference only; it should not be interpreted as guidance 
or an advisory opinion by CFIUS with respect to any particular 
transaction.

II. Summary of Comments

    The public was provided an opportunity to comment on the proposed 
rule, and comments were due by June 5, 2023. During the public comment 
period, the Treasury Department received five comments reflecting a 
range of views. All comments received are available on the public 
rulemaking docket at <a href="https://www.regulations.gov">https://www.regulations.gov</a> and are addressed 
herein.
    The Treasury Department considered each comment submitted on the 
proposed rule. One commenter expressed the view that these provisions 
should be expanded to U.S. developers and realtors to address the 
overdevelopment of U.S. land located in natural disaster zones. The 
rule makes no change in response to this comment as it is outside the 
scope of section 721.
    One commenter expressed the view that the regulations should 
further address risks posed by incompatible development around military 
installations such as from the construction of obstructions, visual and 
other interference from certain land uses, and light emissions, among 
other things. The commenter further expressed a view with respect to 
adding air installations to appendix A and related operational security 
risks. The rule makes no change in response to these comments. The 
Treasury Department and the Defense Department consult on the 
composition of appendix A and part 802 more broadly, taking into 
account the statutory requirements under section 721 and a variety of 
considerations.
    One commenter requested guidance regarding whether legal name 
changes, inherited property, and gifts to relatives would be within the 
definition of a covered real estate transaction under part 802. The 
rule makes no change in response to this comment. Consistent with 
section 721 and as defined in Sec.  802.212(a), a covered real estate 
transaction includes any purchase or lease by, or concession to, a 
foreign person of covered real estate that affords the foreign person 
at least three property rights under Sec.  802.233. Real estate 
acquired by gift or inheritance is distinct from a purchase, lease, or 
concession as those terms are defined in part 802. By contrast, a 
person or entity that amends a property record or document to reflect a 
legal name change may or may not have engaged in a purchase, lease, or 
concession as those terms are defined in part 802--further analysis of 
the underlying reason for the name change would be required. For 
example, a corporate name change may follow an acquisition transaction, 
which, depending on the rights conveyed in that transaction, could be a 
covered real estate transaction (or be subject to CFIUS's jurisdiction 
relating to foreign investment in U.S. businesses which is detailed in 
31 CFR part 800). As a general reminder, the Treasury Department notes 
that pursuant to Sec.  802.212, the definition of a ``covered real 
estate transaction'' includes any transaction, transfer, agreement, or 
arrangement, the structure of which is designed or intended to evade or 
circumvent the application of section 721 as it relates to real estate 
transactions.
    One commenter suggested adding Whiteman Air Force Base in Missouri 
to the list of military installations at appendix A. The rule makes no 
change in response to this comment. As noted in the proposed rule, the 
Defense Department will continue on an ongoing basis to assess its 
military installations and the geographic scope set under the rule to 
ensure appropriate application in light of national security 
considerations.
    One commenter suggested an amendment to Sec.  802.216(c) to exclude 
from the definition of ``excepted real estate transaction'' any 
purchase, lease, or concession of covered real estate by a person owned 
by, controlled by, or subject to the jurisdiction or direction of a 
foreign adversary. The rule makes no change in response to this 
comment. The Treasury Department and the Defense Department consult on 
the definition of ``excepted real estate transaction'' taking into 
account the statutory requirements under section 721 and a variety of 
considerations.
    No additional comments were received. The final rule therefore 
adopts the proposed rule without change other than the technical 
amendments described above.

III. Rulemaking Requirements

Executive Order 12866

    This rule is not subject to the general requirements of Executive 
Order 12866, as amended, which covers review of regulations by the 
Office of Information and Regulatory Affairs in the Office of 
Management and Budget (OMB), because it relates to a foreign affairs 
function of the United States, pursuant to section 3(d)(2) of that 
order. In addition, this rule is not subject to review under section 
6(b) of Executive Order 12866 pursuant to section 1(d) of the June 9, 
2023, Memorandum of Agreement between the Treasury Department and OMB, 
which states that CFIUS regulations are not subject to OMB's standard 
centralized review process under Executive Order 12866.

Regulatory Flexibility Act

    The Regulatory Flexibility Act (RFA) (5 U.S.C. 601 et seq.) 
generally requires an agency to prepare a regulatory flexibility 
analysis, unless the agency

[[Page 57350]]

certifies that the rule, once implemented, will not have a significant 
economic impact on a substantial number of small entities. The final 
rule makes amendments to part 802 (see 85 FR 3158), which the Treasury 
Department previously determined would not significantly impact a 
substantial number of small entities. The amendments in this rule do 
not change that analysis or determination.

Congressional Review Act

    This rule has been submitted to the OMB's Office of Information and 
Regulatory Affairs, which has determined that the rule is not a 
``major'' rule under the Congressional Review Act.

List of Subjects in 31 CFR Part 802

    Foreign investments in the United States, Federal buildings and 
facilities, Government property, Investigations, Investments, 
Investment companies, Land sales, National defense, Public lands, Real
