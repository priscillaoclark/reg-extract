I. Comments

    FHFA-OIG seeks public comments on a new system of records and will 
take all comments into consideration. See 5 U.S.C. 552a(e)(4) and (11). 
In addition to referencing ``Comments/No. 2024-N-14,'' please reference 
``FHFA-OIG-9, Office of Counsel Legal Matters System.''
    FHFA-OIG will post all public comments on the FHFA-OIG public 
website at <a href="http://www.fhfaoig.gov">www.fhfaoig.gov</a>, except as described below. Commenters 
should submit only information that the commenter wishes to make 
available publicly. FHFA-OIG may post only a single representative 
example of identical or substantially identical comments, and in such 
cases will generally identify the number of identical or substantially 
identical comments represented by the posted example. FHFA-OIG may, in 
its discretion, redact or refrain from posting all or any portion of 
any comment that contains content that is obscene, vulgar, profane, or 
threatens harm. All comments, including those that are redacted or not 
posted, will be retained in their original form in FHFA-OIG's internal 
file and considered as required by all applicable laws. Commenters that 
would like FHFA-OIG to consider any portion of their comment exempt 
from disclosure on the basis that it contains trade secrets, or 
financial, confidential or proprietary data or information, should 
follow the procedures in section IV.D. of FHFA's Policy on 
Communications with Outside Parties in Connection with FHFA 
Rulemakings, see <a href="https://www.fhfa.gov/sites/default/files/documents/Ex-Parte-Communications-Public-Policy_3-5-19.pdf">https://www.fhfa.gov/sites/default/files/documents/Ex-Parte-Communications-Public-Policy_3-5-19.pdf</a>. FHFA-OIG cannot 
guarantee that such data or information, or the identity of the 
commenter, will remain confidential if disclosure is sought pursuant to 
an applicable statute or regulation. See 12 CFR 1202.8, 12 CFR 1214.2, 
and FHFA's FOIA Reference Guide at <a href="https://www.fhfa.gov/about/foia-reference-guide">https://www.fhfa.gov/about/foia-reference-guide</a> for additional information.

II. Introduction

    This notice informs the public of FHFA-OIG's proposal to establish 
and maintain a new system of records. This notice satisfies the Privacy 
Act requirement that an agency publish a system of records notice in 
the Federal Register when establishing a new or making a significant 
change to an agency's system of records. Congress has recognized that 
application of all requirements of the Privacy Act to certain 
categories of records may have an undesirable and often unacceptable 
effect upon agencies in the conduct of necessary public business. 
Consequently, Congress established general exemptions and specific 
exemptions that could be used to exempt records from provisions of the 
Privacy Act. Congress also required that exempting records from 
provisions of the Privacy Act would require the head of an agency to 
publish a determination to exempt a record from the Privacy Act as a 
rule in accordance with the Administrative Procedure Act. Records and 
information in this system of records are not exempt from the 
requirements of the Privacy Act.
    As required by the Privacy Act, 5 U.S.C. 552a(r), and pursuant to 
section 7 of Office of Management and Budget (OMB) Circular No. A-108, 
``Federal Agency Responsibilities for Review, Reporting, and 
Publication under the Privacy Act,'' prior to publication of this 
notice, FHFA-OIG submitted a report describing the system of records 
covered by this notice to the OMB, the Committee on Oversight and 
Accountability of the House of Representatives, and the Committee on 
Homeland Security and Governmental Affairs of the Senate.

III. New System of Records

    The information in this system of records will be used by FHFA-OIG 
to process and track legal opinions/advice, administrative hearings, 
litigation, and other legal projects and assignments, for FHFA-OIG's 
Office of Counsel. The new system of records is described in detail 
below.

SYSTEM NAME AND NUMBER:
    Office of Counsel Legal Matters System, FHFA-OIG-9.

SECURITY CLASSIFICATION:
    Unclassified.

SYSTEM LOCATION:
    Office of Inspector General, Federal Housing Finance Agency, 400 
Seventh Street SW, Washington, DC 20219, and any alternate work site 
used by employees of FHFA-OIG and contractors assisting agency 
employees.

SYSTEM MANAGER(S):
    Chief Counsel, Office of Counsel, (202) 649-3065, Office of 
Inspector General, Federal Housing Finance Agency, 400 Seventh Street 
SW, Washington, DC 20219.

AUTHORITY FOR MAINTENANCE OF THE SYSTEM:
    12 CFR 1200.1 through 1200.2; 5 U.S.C. 301; 5 U.S.C. 402 through 
403; 12 U.S.C. 4517(d); and 44 U.S.C. 3101.

 PURPOSE(S) OF THE SYSTEM:
    The purpose of this system is to support the Inspector General and 
FHFA-OIG staff on legal matters related to the functions, activities, 
operations, and employees of FHFA-OIG. In addition, the system of 
records may be used to track the status, progress, and disposition of 
matters assigned to the legal staff, generate reports about any past or 
planned activities for each matter, and capture summary information 
(such as timelines, due dates, and work assignments). The system will 
also maintain historical reference information pertaining to such 
matters.

CATEGORIES OF INDIVIDUALS COVERED BY THE SYSTEM:
    Individuals covered by this system are employees of and detailees 
to the Office of Counsel, assigned contractor personnel; parties, 
witnesses, subjects, complainants, and other persons

[[Page 84599]]

involved in litigation, administrative actions, and other legal 
proceedings and activities conducted by FHFA-OIG.

CATEGORIES OF RECORDS IN THE SYSTEM:
    Records maintained in this system include memoranda, personnel 
documents, litigation documents, and other legal records that may 
contain information such as the names, addresses, email addresses, and 
telephone numbers for current or former FHFA-OIG employees and 
contractor personnel, as well as descriptions of the matters as 
provided by assigned FHFA-OIG staff. Records also may contain the names 
of individuals or companies and associated entities that are relevant 
to a matter, including parties, witnesses, agency employees, and agents 
of the entities that FHFA regulates, interagency partners, and may 
derive from pleadings and discovery materials generated in connection 
with civil proceedings or administrative actions, as well as 
correspondence or memoranda related to work assignments.

RECORD SOURCE CATEGORIES:
    The names, business email addresses, and business telephone numbers 
for FHFA-OIG employees and contractor personnel are obtained from the 
FHFA-OIG Active Directory. Records also are provided by the Office of 
Counsel employees and contractor personnel assigned to legal matters 
and may derive from pleadings or discovery materials in connection with 
civil proceedings or administrative actions, as well as correspondence 
or memoranda related to work assignments.

ROUTINE USES OF RECORDS MAINTAINED IN THE SYSTEM, INCLUDING CATEGORIES 
OF USERS AND PURPOSES OF SUCH USES:
    In addition to those disclosures generally permitted under 5 U.S.C. 
552a(b) of the Privacy Act, these records and the information contained 
therein may be disclosed outside of FHFA-OIG as a routine use pursuant 
to 5 U.S.C. 552a(b)(3) as follows, to the extent such disclosures are 
compatible with the purposes for which the information was collected:
    (1) To appropriate agencies, entities, and persons when--(a) FHFA-
OIG suspects or has confirmed that there has been a breach of the 
system of records; (b) FHFA-OIG has determined that as a result of a 
suspected or confirmed breach there is a risk of harm to individuals, 
FHFA-OIG (including its information systems, programs, and operations), 
the Federal Government, or national security; and (c) the disclosure 
made to such agencies, entities, and persons as reasonably necessary to 
assist with FHFA-OIG's efforts to (i) respond to a suspected or 
confirmed breach or (ii) prevent, minimize, or remedy such harm.
    (2) To another federal agency or federal entity, when FHFA-OIG 
determines that information from this system of records is reasonably 
necessary to assist the recipient agency or entity in: (a) responding 
to a suspected or confirmed breach or; (b) preventing, minimizing, or 
remedying the risk of harm to individuals, the recipient agency or 
entity (including its information systems, programs, and operations), 
the Federal Government, or to national security, resulting from a 
suspected or confirmed breach.
    (3) When there is evidence of a violation or potential violation of 
law (whether civil, criminal, or regulatory in nature, and whether 
arising by general statute or particular program statute or by 
regulation, rule or order), the relevant records in the system of 
records may be referred, as a routine use, to the appropriate agency 
(e.g., federal, state, local, tribal, foreign, or a financial 
regulatory organization) charged with the responsibility of 
investigating or prosecuting such violations or charged with enforcing 
or implementing a statute, rule, regulation, or order.
    (4) To any individual during the course of an inquiry or 
investigation conducted by FHFA-OIG, or in connection with litigation, 
if FHFA-OIG has reason to believe the individual to whom the record is 
disclosed may have further information relevant to the inquiry, 
investigation, or litigation.
    (5) To contractors, agents, or other authorized persons performing 
work on behalf of FHFA-OIG who have a need to access the information in 
the performance of their official duties or activities.
    (6) To appropriate third parties contracted by FHFA-OIG to 
facilitate mediation or other dispute resolution procedures or 
programs.
    (7) To outside counsel contracted by FHFA-OIG, the U.S. Department 
of Justice (DOJ) (including United States Attorney Offices), or other 
federal agencies conducting litigation or in proceedings before any 
court, adjudicative or administrative body, when it is relevant and 
necessary to the litigation and one of the following is a party to the 
litigation or has an interest in the litigation:
    a. FHFA-OIG;
    b. An employee of FHFA-OIG in his/her official capacity;
    c. An employee of FHFA-OIG in his/her individual capacity where DOJ 
or FHFA-OIG has agreed to represent the employee; or
    d. The United States or a federal agency, and FHFA-OIG determines 
that the records are relevant and necessary to the litigation and the 
use of the records is compatible with the purpose for which FHFA-OIG 
collected the records.
    (8) To the National Archives and Records Administration or other 
federal agencies pursuant to records management inspections being 
conducted under the authority of 44 U.S.C. 2904 and 2906.
    (9) To an agency, organization, or individual for the purpose of 
performing audit or oversight activities as authorized by law, but only 
such information as is relevant and necessary to such activities.
    (10) To another federal Office of the Inspector General, law 
enforcement Task Force, or other federal, state, local, foreign, 
territorial, or tribal unit of government, other public authorities, or 
self-regulatory organizations for the purpose of preventing and/or 
identifying fraud, waste, or abuse related to FHFA's programs or 
operations.
    (11) To other federal Offices of Inspector General or other 
entities, during the conduct of internal and external peer reviews of 
FHFA-OIG.
    (12) To the public or to the media for release to the public when 
the matter under audit, review, evaluation, investigation, or inquiry 
has become public knowledge, or when the Inspector General determines 
that such disclosure is necessary either to preserve confidence in the 
integrity of FHFA-OIG's audit, review, evaluation, investigative, or 
inquiry processes or is necessary to demonstrate the accountability of 
FHFA-OIG employees, officers or individuals covered by the system, 
unless the Inspector General or his/her delegee determines, after 
consultation with counsel and the Senior Privacy Official, that release 
of the specific information in the context of a particular case would 
constitute an unwarranted invasion of personal privacy.
    (13) To Congress, congressional committees, or the staffs thereof, 
once an FHFA-OIG report or management alert has become final and the 
Inspector General determines that its disclosure is necessary to 
fulfill the Inspector General's responsibilities under the Inspector 
General Act of 1978.
    (14) To a federal agency or other entity which requires information 
relevant to a decision concerning the hiring, appointment, or retention 
of an employee or contractor; the assignment, detail, or deployment of 
an employee or

[[Page 84600]]

contractor; the issuance, renewal, suspension, or revocation of an 
employee's or contractor's security clearance; the execution of a 
security or suitability investigation; the adjudication of liability; 
or coverage under FHFA-OIG's liability insurance policy.
    (15) To the Council of the Inspectors General on Integrity and 
Efficiency and its committees, another federal Office of Inspector 
General, or other Federal law enforcement office in connection with an 
allegation of wrongdoing by the Inspector General or by designated 
FHFA-OIG staff members.

POLICIES AND PRACTICES FOR STORAGE OF RECORDS:
    Records are maintained in electronic format. Electronic records are 
stored on FHFA-OIG's secure network, authorized cloud service 
providers, and authorized contractor networks located within the 
continental United States. Paper records are stored in locked offices, 
locked file rooms, and locked file cabinets or safes.

POLICIES AND PRACTICES FOR RETRIEVAL OF RECORDS:
    Records will be retrieved primarily by an individual's name or 
business email address but may also be obtained by a search using any 
search term or filter.

POLICIES AND PRACTICIES FOR RETENTION AND DISPOSAL OF RECORDS:
    Records are retained and disposed of in accordance with FHFA's 
Comprehensive Record Schedule, Section 4 (N1-543-11-1, approved on 01/
11/2013) and the FHFA-OIG File Plan.

ADMINISTRATIVE, TECHNICAL, AND PHYSICAL SAFEGUARDS:
    Records are maintained in controlled access areas. Electronic 
records are protected by restricted access procedures, including user 
identifications and passwords. Only FHFA-OIG staff (and FHFA-OIG 
contractors assisting such staff) whose official duties require access 
are allowed to view, administer, and control these records. The System 
Owner controls access to this System and limits access in accordance 
with the above.
