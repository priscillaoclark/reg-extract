other than those related to rulemaking or pertaining principally to 
monetary and credit policies, to one or more administrative law judges, 
members or staff of the Board, or the Reserve Banks.\1\ The Board has 
delegated authority to Board members (in their individual capacity and

(delegation rules) implement section 11(k) of the Federal Reserve Act 
and enumerate the actions that the Board has determined to delegate. By 
delegating actions that do not raise significant legal, supervisory, or

requests, and other matters.
