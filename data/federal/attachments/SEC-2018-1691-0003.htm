SECURITIES AND EXCHANGE COMMISSION

[SEC File No. 270-446, OMB Control No. 3235-0503]


Proposed Collection; Comment Request; Extension: Form N-6

Upon Written Request, Copies Available From: Securities and Exchange 
Commission, Office of FOIA Services, 100 F Street NE, Washington, DC 
20549-2736

    Notice is hereby given that, pursuant to the Paperwork Reduction 
Act of 1995 (44 U.S.C. 3501 et seq.), the Securities and Exchange 
Commission (the ``Commission'') is soliciting comments on the 
collection of information summarized below. The Commission plans to 
submit this existing collection of information to the Office of 
Management and Budget for extension and approval.
    The title for the collection of information is ``Form N-6 (17 CFR 
239.17c and 274.11d) under the Securities Act of 1933 (15 U.S.C. 77a et 
seq.) and under the Investment Company Act of 1940 (15 U.S.C. 80a-1 et 
seq.) registration statement of separate accounts organized as unit 
investment trusts that offer variable life insurance policies.'' Form 
N-6 is the form used by insurance company separate accounts organized 
as unit investment trusts that offer variable life insurance contracts 
to register as investment companies under the Investment Company Act of 
1940 and/or to register their securities under the Securities Act of 
1933. The primary purpose of the registration process is to provide 
disclosure of financial and other information to investors and 
potential investors for the purpose of evaluating an investment in a 
security. Form N-6 also requires separate accounts organized as unit 
investment trusts that offer variable life insurance policies to 
provide investors with a prospectus and a statement of additional 
information (``SAI'') covering essential information about the separate 
account when it makes an initial or additional offering of its 
securities.
    The Commission estimates that approximately 448 registration 
statements (20 initial registration statements plus 428 post-effective 
amendments) are filed on Form N-6 annually. The estimated hour burden 
per portfolio for preparing and filing an initial registration 
statement on Form N-6 is 772.25 hours. The estimated annual hour burden 
for preparing and filing initial registration statements is 15,445 
hours (20 initial registration statements annually times 772.25 hours 
per registration statement). The Commission estimates that the hour 
burden for preparing and filing a post-effective amendment on Form N-6 
is 154.25 hours. The total annual hour burden for preparing and filing 
post-effective amendments is 66,019 hours (428 post-effective 
amendments annually times 154.25 hours per amendment). The frequency of 
response is annual. The total annual hour burden for Form N-6, 
therefore, is estimated to be 81,464 hours (15,445 hours for initial 
registration statements plus 66,019 hours for post-effective 
amendments).
    The Commission estimates that the cost burden for preparing an 
initial Form N-6 filing is $40,000 per filing and the current cost 
burden for preparing a post-effective amendment to a previously 
effective registration statement is $20,000 per filing. Thus, the total 
cost burden allocated to Form N-6 would be $9,360,000 (20 initial 
filings times $40,000 and 428 post-effective amendment filings times 
$20,000).
    The information collection requirements imposed by Form N-6 are 
mandatory. Responses to the collection of information will not be kept

confidential. Estimates of average burden hours are made solely for the 
purposes of the Paperwork Reduction Act, and are not derived from a 
comprehensive or even a representative survey or study of the costs of 
Commission rules and forms. An agency may not conduct or sponsor, and a 
person is not required to respond to a collection of information unless 
it displays a currently valid control number.
    Written comments are invited on: (a) whether the proposed 
collection of information is necessary for the proper performance of 
the functions of the Commission, including whether the information 
shall have practical utility; (b) the accuracy of the Commission's 
estimate of the burden of the collection of information; (c) ways to 
enhance the quality, utility, and clarity of the information collected; 
and (d) ways to minimize the burden of the collection of information on 
respondents, including through the use of automated collection 
techniques or other forms of information technology. Consideration will 
be given to comments and suggestions submitted by July 9, 2024.
    An agency may not conduct or sponsor, and a person is not required 
to respond to, a collection of information under the PRA unless it 
displays a currently valid OMB control number.

Information Officer, Securities and Exchange Commission, c/o John
