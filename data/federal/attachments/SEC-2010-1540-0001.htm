I. Self-Regulatory Organization's Statement of the Terms of Substance 
of the Proposed Rule Change

    The Exchange proposes for the CBOE Stock Exchange (``CBSX'') to 
modify its CBSX Extended Trading Hours to permit trading to open at 
7:30 a.m. Central Time and continue until 3:45 p.m. Central Time. The 
text of the proposed rule change is available on the Exchange's Web 
site (<A HREF="http://frwebgate.access.gpo.gov/cgi-bin/leaving.cgi?from=leavingFR.html&log=linklog&to=http://www.cboe.org/legal">http://www.cboe.org/legal</A>), at the Exchange's principal office, 
and at the Commission's Public Reference Room.

II. Self-Regulatory Organization's Statement of the Purpose of, and 
Statutory Basis for, the Proposed Rule Change

    In its filing with the Commission, the CBOE included statements 
concerning the purpose of and basis for the proposed rule change and 
discussed any comments it received on the proposed rule change. The 
text of those statements may be examined at the places specified in 
Item IV below. The Exchange has prepared summaries, set forth in 
sections A, B, and C below, of the most significant parts of such 
statements.

A. Self-Regulatory Organization's Statement of the Purpose of, and the 
Statutory Basis for, the Proposed Rule Change

1. Purpose
    Currently, CBSX is open for trading from 8 a.m. until 3:30 p.m. 
(all times Central unless otherwise denoted), with the time period from 
8:30 a.m. until 3 p.m. designated as CBSX Regular Trading Hours and the 
time periods from 8 a.m. until 8:30 a.m. and 3 p.m. until 3:30 p.m. 
designated as CBSX Extended Trading Hours. The Exchange has, in the 
past, made similar changes to extend CBSX trading hours.\5\ CBSX 
proposes to extend its hours of business to open for trading at 7:30 
a.m. and close trading at 3:45 p.m. This change would not affect CBSX 
Regular Trading Hours; the new trading periods (7:30 a.m. until 8 a.m. 
and 3:30 p.m. until 3:45 p.m.) would merely extend the CBSX Extended 
Trading Hours.
---------------------------------------------------------------------------

    \5\ See Securities Exchange Act Release Nos. 34-61349 (January 
14, 2010), 75 FR 3511 (January 21, 2010) (SR-CBOE-2010-004) and 34-
60910 (October 30, 2009), 74 FR 57718 (November 9, 2009) (SR-CBOE-
2010-083). In both cases, the Commission waived the 30-day operative 
delay period.
---------------------------------------------------------------------------

    The Exchange represents that the modified opening and closing times 
will have no implications for CBSX systems. The Exchange represents 
that CBSX traders will have been notified of the time change via 
circular prior to the rule change taking effect. Lastly, the Exchange 
represents that appropriate surveillance will be in place for the new 
trading hours.
2. Statutory Basis
    The Exchange believes the proposed rule change is consistent with 
the Act \6\ and the rules and regulations thereunder and, in 
particular, the requirements of Section 6(b) of the Act.\7\ 
Specifically, the Exchange believes the proposed rule change is 
consistent with the Section 6(b)(5) \8\ requirements that the rules of 
an exchange be designed to promote just and equitable principles of 
trade, to prevent fraudulent and manipulative acts, to remove 
impediments to and to perfect the mechanism for a free and open market 
and a national market system, and, in general, to protect investors and 
the public interest. Permitting trading earlier in the morning and 
until later in the day will permit investors greater opportunity to 
participate in the market, thereby removing an impediment to trading.

    \8\ 15 U.S.C. 78f(b)(5).
---------------------------------------------------------------------------

B. Self-Regulatory Organization's Statement on Burden on Competition

    CBOE does not believe that the proposed rule change will impose any 
burden on competition not necessary or appropriate in furtherance of 
the purposes of the Act.

C. Self-Regulatory Organization's Statement on Comments on the Proposed 
Rule Change Received From Members, Participants, or Others

    The Exchange neither solicited nor received comments on the 
proposal.

III. Date of Effectiveness of the Proposed Rule Change and Timing for 
Commission Action

    Because the foregoing rule does not (i) Significantly affect the 
protection of investors or the public interest; (ii) impose any 
significant burden on competition; and (iii) become operative for 30 
days from the date on which it was filed, or such shorter time as the 
Commission may designate if consistent with the protection of investors 
and the public interest, the proposed rule change has become effective 
pursuant to Section 19(b)(3)(A) of the Act \9\ and Rule 19b-4(f)(6) 
thereunder.\10\
---------------------------------------------------------------------------

    \9\ 15 U.S.C. 78s(b)(3)(A).
    \10\ 17 CFR 240.19b-4(f)(6). In addition, Rule 19b-4(f)(6)(iii) 
requires the Exchange to give the Commission written notice of the 
Exchange's intent to file the proposed rule change, along with a 
brief description and text of the proposed rule change, at least 
five business days prior to the date of filing of the proposed rule 
change, or such shorter time as designated by the Commission. The 
Commission has waived the five-day pre-filing requirement in this 
case.
---------------------------------------------------------------------------

    The Exchange has requested that the Commission waive the 30-day 
operative delay. The Commission believes that waiving the 30-day 
operative delay is consistent with the protection of investors and the 
public interest because such waiver will permit market participants to 
trade on CBSX in extended trading hours that are available on other 
exchanges.\11\ Accordingly, the Commission designates the proposed rule 
change operative upon filing with the Commission.\12\
---------------------------------------------------------------------------

    \11\ See, e.g., NASDAQ Stock Market Rule 4617 and NASDAQ OMX 
PHLX Rule 101.
    \12\ For the purposes only of waiving the 30-day operative 
delay, the Commission has considered the proposed rule's impact on 
efficiency, competition, and capital formation. See 15 U.S.C. 
78(c)(f).
---------------------------------------------------------------------------

    At any time within 60 days of the filing of the proposed rule 
change, the

[[Page 62615]]

Commission summarily may temporarily suspend such rule change if it 
appears to the Commission that such action is necessary or appropriate 
in the public interest, for the protection of investors, or otherwise 
in furtherance of the purposes of the Act.
