SECURITIES AND EXCHANGE COMMISSION

[SEC File No. 270-666, OMB Control No. 3235-0725]


Submission for OMB Review; Comment Request; Extension: Contract 
Standard for Contractor Workforce Inclusion

Upon Written Request, Copies Available From: Securities and Exchange 
Commission, Office of FOIA Services, 100 F Street NE, Washington, DC 
20549-2736

    Notice is hereby given that, pursuant to the Paperwork Reduction 
Act of 1995 (44 U.S.C. 3501 et seq.), the Securities and Exchange 
Commission (``Commission'') has submitted to the Office of Management 
and Budget a request for extension of the previously approved 
collection of information discussed below.

[[Page 76898]]

    Section 342 of the Dodd-Frank Wall Street Reform and Consumer 
Protection Act of 2010 (the Dodd-Frank Act) provided that certain 
agencies, including the Commission, establish an Office of Minority and 
Women Inclusion (OMWI).\1\ Section 342(c)(2) of the Dodd-Frank Act 
requires the OMWI Director to include in the Commission's procedures 
for evaluating contract proposals and hiring service providers a 
written statement that the contractor shall ensure, to the maximum 
extent possible, the fair inclusion of women and minorities in the 
workforce of the contractor and, as applicable, subcontractors. To 
implement the acquisition-specific requirements of ection 342(c)(2) of 
the Dodd-Frank Act, the Commission adopted a Contract Standard for 
Contractor Workforce Inclusion (Contract Standard).
---------------------------------------------------------------------------

    \1\ 12 U.S.C. 5452.
---------------------------------------------------------------------------

    The Contract Standard, which is included in the Commission's 
solicitations and resulting contracts for services with a dollar value 
of $100,000 or more, contains a ``collection of information'' within 
the meaning of the Paperwork Reduction Act. The Contract Standard 
requires that a Commission contractor with 50 or more employees provide 
documentation, upon request from the OMWI Director, to demonstrate that 
it has made good faith efforts to ensure the fair inclusion of 
minorities and women in its workforce and, as applicable, to 
demonstrate its covered subcontractors have made such good faith 
efforts. The documentation requested may include, but is not limited 
to: (1) the total number of employees in the contractor's workforce, 
and the number of employees by race, ethnicity, gender, and job title 
or EEO-1 job category (e.g., EEO-1 Report(s)); (2) a list of covered 
subcontract awards under the contract that includes the dollar amount 
of each subcontract, date of award, and the subcontractor's race, 
ethnicity, and/or gender ownership status; (3) the contractor's plan to 
ensure the fair inclusion of minorities and women in its workforce, 
including outreach efforts; and (4) for each covered subcontractor, the 
information requested in items 1 and 3 above. The OMWI Director will 
consider the information submitted in evaluating whether the contractor 
or subcontractor has complied with its obligations under the Contract 
Standard.
    The information collection is mandatory.
    Title of Collection: Contract Standard for Contractor Workforce 
Inclusion.
    Type of Review: Extension of an Existing Approved Information 
Collection.
    Frequency of Response: Annually.
    Estimated Number of Respondents: 50.
    Estimated Burden Hours per Respondent: 1 hour.
    Estimated Total Annual Burden Hours: 50. The change in the 
estimated annual burden hours from 925 to 50 is due to a change in 
eligibility criteria for requesting documentation to only those 
contractors with 50 or more employees. This change in eligibility 
criteria eliminated any new recordkeeping burden since contractors with 
50 or more employees are generally subject to the recordkeeping and 
reporting requirements under the regulations implementing Title VII of 
the Civil Rights Act \2\ and Executive Order 11246.
---------------------------------------------------------------------------

    \2\ 42 U.S.C. 2000e, et seq.
---------------------------------------------------------------------------

    On July 15, 2024, the Commission published a notice in the Federal 
Register (89 FR 57451) of its intention to request an extension of this 
currently approved collection of information and allowed the public 60 
days to submit comments. The Commission received no comments.
    Written comments continue to be invited on: (a) whether this 
collection of information is necessary for the proper performance of 
the functions of the agency, including whether the information will 
have practical utility; (b) the accuracy of the agency's estimate of 
the burden imposed by the collection of information; (c) ways to 
enhance the quality, utility, and clarity of the information collected; 
and (d) ways to minimize the burden of the collection of information on 
respondents, including through the use of automated collection 
techniques or other forms of information technology.
    An agency may not conduct or sponsor, and a person is not required 
to respond to, a collection of information under the PRA unless it 
displays a currently valid OMB control number.
