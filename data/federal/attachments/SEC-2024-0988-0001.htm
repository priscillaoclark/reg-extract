SECURITIES AND EXCHANGE COMMISSION

[SEC File No. 270-036, OMB Control No. 3235-0028]


Proposed Collection; Comment Request; Extension: Rule 17f-2(d)

Upon Written Request, Copies Available From: Securities and Exchange 
Commission, Office of FOIA Services, 100 F Street NE, Washington, DC 
20549-2736

    Notice is hereby given that pursuant to the Paperwork Reduction Act 
of 1995 (``PRA'') (44 U.S.C. 3501 et seq.), the Securities and Exchange 
Commission (``Commission'') is soliciting comments on the existing 
collection of information provided for in Rule 17f-2(d) (17 CFR 
240.17f-2(d)), under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 (15 U.S.C. 78a 
et seq.). The Commission plans to submit this existing collection of 
information to the Office of Management and Budget (``OMB'') for 
extension and approval.
    Rule 17f-2(d) requires that records created pursuant to the 
fingerprinting requirements of Section 17(f)(2) of the Act be 
maintained and preserved by every member of a national securities 
exchange, broker, dealer, registered transfer agent and registered 
clearing agency (``covered entities'' or ``respondents''); permits, 
under certain circumstances, the records required to be maintained and 
preserved by a member of a national securities exchange, broker, or 
dealer to be maintained and preserved by a self-regulatory organization 
that is also the designated examining authority for that member, broker 
or dealer; and permits the required records to be preserved on 
microfilm. The general purpose for Rule 17f-2 is to: (i) identify 
security risk personnel; (ii) provide criminal record

[[Page 59941]]

information so that employers can make fully informed employment 
decisions; and (iii) deter persons with criminal records from seeking 
employment or association with covered entities. The rule enables the 
Commission or other examining authority to ascertain whether all 
required persons are being fingerprinted and whether proper procedures 
regarding fingerprinting are being followed. Retention of these records 
for a period of not less than three years after termination of a 
covered person's employment or relationship with a covered entity 
ensures that law enforcement officials will have easy access to 
fingerprint cards on a timely basis. This in turn acts as an effective 
deterrent to employee misconduct.
    Approximately 3,800 respondents are subject to the recordkeeping 
requirements of the rule. Each respondent maintains approximately 68 
new records per year, each of which takes approximately 2 minutes per 
record to maintain, for an annual burden of approximately 2.2666667 
hours (68 records times 2 minutes). The total annual time burden for 
all respondents is approximately 8,613 hours (3,800 respondents times 
2.2666667 hours). As noted above, all records maintained subject to the 
rule must be retained for a period of not less than three years after 
termination of a covered person's employment or relationship with a 
covered entity. In addition, we estimate the total annual cost burden 
to respondents is approximately $38,000 in third party storage costs.
    Written comments are invited on: (a) whether the proposed 
collection of information is necessary for the proper performance of 
the functions of the Commission, including whether the information 
shall have practical utility; (b) the accuracy of the Commission's 
estimates of the burden of the proposed collection of information; (c) 
ways to enhance the quality, utility, and clarity of the information 
collected; and (d) ways to minimize the burden of the collection of 
information on respondents, including through the use of automated 
collection techniques or other forms of information technology. 
Consideration will be given to comments and suggestions submitted by 
September 23, 2024.
    An agency may not conduct or sponsor, and a person is not required 
to respond to, a collection of information under the PRA unless it 
displays a currently valid OMB control number.
    Please direct your written comments to: Austin Gerig, Director/
Chief Data Officer, Securities and Exchange Commission, c/o Oluwaseun 
Ajayi, 100 F Street NE, Washington, DC 20549, or send an email to:

Deputy Secretary.
