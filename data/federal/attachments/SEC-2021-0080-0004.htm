SECURITIES AND EXCHANGE COMMISSION

[SEC File No. 270-139, OMB Control No. 3235-0128]


Submission for OMB Review; Comment Request; Extension: Rule 12f-1

Upon Written Request, Copies Available From: Securities and Exchange 
Commission, Office of FOIA Services, 100 F Street NE, Washington, DC 
20549-2736

    Notice is hereby given that, pursuant to the Paperwork Reduction 
Act of 1995 (``PRA'') (44 U.S.C. 3501 et seq.), the Securities and 
Exchange Commission (``Commission'') has submitted to the Office of 
Management and Budget (``OMB'') a request for approval of extension of 
the previously approved collection of information provided for in Rule 
12f-1 (17 CFR 240.12f-1) under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 
(``Act'') (15 U.S.C. 78a et seq.).
    Rule 12f-1 (``Rule''), originally adopted in 1979 pursuant to 
Sections 12(f) and 23(a) of the Act, and as further modified in 1995 
and 2005, sets forth the requirements for filing an exchange 
application to reinstate unlisted trading privileges (``UTP'') in a 
security in which UTP has been suspended by the Commission pursuant to 
Section 12(f)(2)(A) of the Act. Under Rule 12f-1, an exchange must 
submit one copy of an application for reinstatement of UTP to the 
Commission that contains specified information, as set forth in the 
Rule. The application for reinstatement, pursuant to the Rule, must 
provide the name of the issuer, the title of the security, the name of 
each national securities exchange, if any, on which the security is 
listed or admitted to unlisted trading privileges, whether transaction 
information concerning the security is reported pursuant to an 
effective transaction reporting plan contemplated by Rule 601 of 
Regulation NMS, the date of the Commission's suspension of unlisted 
trading privileges in the security on the exchange, and any other 
pertinent information related to whether the reinstatement of UTP in 
the subject security is consistent with the maintenance of fair and 
orderly markets and the protection of investors. Rule 12f-1 further 
requires a national securities exchange seeking to reinstate its 
ability to extend unlisted trading privileges in a security to indicate 
that it has provided a copy of such application to the issuer of the 
security, as well as to any other national securities exchange on which 
the security is listed or admitted to unlisted trading privileges.
    The information required by Rule 12f-1 enables the Commission to 
make the necessary findings under the Act prior to granting 
applications to reinstate unlisted trading privileges. This information 
is also made available to members of the public who may wish to comment 
upon the applications. Without the Rule, the Commission would be unable 
to fulfill these statutory responsibilities.
    There are currently 24 national securities exchanges subject to 
Rule 12f-1. The burden of complying with Rule 12f-1 arises when a 
potential respondent seeks to reinstate its ability to extend unlisted 
trading privileges to any security for which unlisted trading 
privileges have been suspended by the Commission, pursuant to Section 
12(f)(2)(A) of the Act. The staff estimates that each application would 
require approximately one hour to complete. Thus, each potential 
respondent would incur on average one burden hour in complying with the 
Rule.
    The Commission staff estimates that there could be as many as 24 
responses annually for an aggregate annual hour burden for all 
respondents of approximately 24 hours (24 responses x 1 hour per 
response). Each respondent's related internal cost of compliance for 
Rule 12f-1 would be approximately $242.00 (the cost of one hour of 
professional work of a paralegal needed to complete the application). 
The total annual cost of compliance for all potential respondents, 
therefore, is approximately $5,808 (24 responses x $242.00 per 
response).
    Compliance with Rule 12f-1 is mandatory. Rule 12f-1 does not have a 
record retention requirement per se. However, responses made pursuant 
to Rule 12f-1 are subject to the recordkeeping requirements of Rules 
17a-3 and 17a-4 of the Act. Information received in response to Rule 
12f-1 shall not be kept confidential; the information collected is 
public information.
    An agency may not conduct or sponsor, and a person is not required 
to respond to, a collection of information under the PRA unless it 
displays a currently valid OMB control number.

collection at the following website: <a href="http://www.reginfo.gov">www.reginfo.gov</a>. Find this
