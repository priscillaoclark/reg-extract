Background

    On July 22, 2004, the President, invoking the authority of, inter 
alia, the International Emergency Economic Powers Act (50 U.S.C. 1701-
1706) (``IEEPA'') and section 5 of the United Nations Participation Act 
(22 U.S.C. 287c), issued Executive Order 13348 (69 FR 44885, July 27, 
2004) (''the Order''), effective at 12:01 a.m. eastern daylight time on 
July 23, 2004. The Order also noted United Nations Security Council 
Resolutions 1521 of December 22, 2003, and 1532 of March 12, 2004, 
which, inter alia, called on member states to impose an asset freeze on 
certain senior members of former Liberian President Charles Taylor's 
government and certain other persons and to prevent the importation 
into their territories of all round logs and timber products 
originating in Liberia.
    Section 1(a) of the Order blocks, with certain exceptions, all 
property and interests in property that are in the United States, that 
hereafter come within the United States, or that are or hereafter come 
within the possession or control of United States persons, of: (1) The 
persons listed in an Annex to the Order; and (2) any person determined 
by the Secretary of the Treasury, in consultation with the Secretary of 
State:
    <bullet> To be or have been an immediate family member of Charles 
Taylor;
    <bullet> To have been a senior official of the former Liberian 
regime headed by Charles Taylor or otherwise to have been or be a close 
ally or associate of Charles Taylor or the former Liberian regime;
    <bullet> To have materially assisted, sponsored, or provided 
financial, material, or technological support for, or goods or services 
in support of, the unlawful depletion of Liberian resources, the 
removal of Liberian resources from that country, and the secreting of 
Liberian funds and property by any person whose property and interests 
in property are blocked pursuant to the Order; or
    <bullet> To be owned or controlled by, or acting or purporting to 
act for or on behalf of, directly or indirectly, any person whose 
property and interests in property are blocked pursuant to the Order.
    In Section 1(b) of the Order, the President determined that the 
exemption from IEEPA regulation provided in section 203(b)(2) of IEEPA 
(50 U.S.C. 1702(b)(2)) for the making of donations of the types of 
articles specified in such section (i.e., articles, such as food, 
clothing, and medicine, intended to be used to relieve human suffering) 
by, to, or for the benefit of, any person whose property and interests 
in property are blocked pursuant to the Order would seriously impair 
his ability to deal with the national emergency declared in the Order, 
and prohibited such donations. Accordingly, the donation of such items 
is not exempted from the scope of these regulations and is prohibited, 
unless authorized by OFAC.
    Section 1(c) of the Order provides that the blocking of property 
and interests in property includes, but is not limited to, the making 
or receiving of any contribution or provision of funds, goods or 
services by, to, or for the benefit of, any person listed in or 
designated pursuant to the Order, and the receipt of any contribution 
or provision of funds, goods, or services from any such person.
    Section 2 of the Order prohibits, with certain exceptions, the 
direct or indirect importation into the United States of any round log 
or timber product originating in Liberia.
    Section 3 of the Order prohibits any transaction by a United States 
person that evades or avoids, or has the purpose of evading or 
avoiding, or attempts to violate, any of the prohibitions set forth in 
the Order, as well as any conspiracy formed to violate such 
prohibitions.
    Section 6 of the Order authorizes the Secretary of the Treasury, in 
consultation with the Secretary of State, to take such actions, 
including the promulgation of rules and regulations, as may be 
necessary to carry out the purposes of the Order. Acting under 
authority delegated by the Secretary of

[[Page 28856]]

the Treasury, the Department of the Treasury's Office of Foreign Assets 
Control (``OFAC'') is promulgating these Former Liberian Regime of 
Charles Taylor Sanctions Regulations, 31 CFR part 593 (the 
``Regulations'').
    These regulations are promulgated in furtherance of the sanctions 
set forth in Executive Order 13348, which are targeted sanctions 
directed at the regime of former President Charles Taylor. The 
sanctions are not directed against the country of Liberia, the 
Government of Liberia, or the Central Bank of Liberia. They do not 
generally prohibit the provision of banking services to the country of 
Liberia, including the maintenance of correspondent banking 
relationships with Liberian banks, unless the bank in question, or any 
other person engaged in the transaction, is a person whose property and 
interests in property are blocked pursuant to Sec.  593.201(a). In 
addition, the importation into the United States of rough diamonds from 
Liberia is governed by the Rough Diamonds Control Regulations, 31 CFR 
part 592.
    Subpart B of the Regulations implements the prohibitions contained 
in Sections 1, 2, and 3 of the Order. See Sec. Sec.  593.201, 593.205, 
and 593.206. Appendix A to 31 CFR chapter V has previously been amended 
to incorporate the names of persons set forth in the Annex to the 
Order. Persons identified in the Annex to the Order or designated by or 
under the authority of the Secretary of the Treasury pursuant to the 
Order are referred to throughout the Regulations as ``persons whose 
property and interests in property are blocked pursuant to Sec.  
593.201(a).'' Their names are or will be published on OFAC's Specially 
Designated Nationals and Blocked Persons List, which is accessible via 
OFAC's Web site, announced in the Federal Register, and incorporated on 
an ongoing basis into appendix A to 31 CFR chapter V, which lists 
persons who are the targets of various sanctions programs administered 
by OFAC.
    Sections 593.202 and 593.203 of subpart B detail the effect of 
transfers of blocked property in violation of the Regulations and set 
forth the requirement to hold blocked funds, such as currency, bank 
deposits, or liquidated financial obligations, in interest-bearing 
blocked accounts. Section 593.204 of subpart B provides that all 
expenses incident to the maintenance of blocked physical property shall 
be the responsibility of the owners and operators of such property, and 
that such expenses shall not be met from blocked funds. The section 
further provides that blocked property may, in the discretion of the 
Director of OFAC, be sold or liquidated and the net proceeds placed in 
a blocked interest-bearing account in the name of the owner of the 
property.
    Section 593.205 sets forth the prohibition contained in Section 2 
of the Order with respect to the importation into the United States of 
round logs or timber products from Liberia. However, in Resolution 1689 
of June 20, 2006, the United Nations Security Council decided to lift 
the multilateral prohibition on importation of round logs and timber 
products set forth in paragraph 10 of Resolution 1521. In accordance 
with the decision of the Security Council in Resolution 1689, OFAC is 
issuing Sec.  593.510, a general license authorizing the importation 
into the United States of round logs and timber products originating in 
Liberia.
    Subpart C of part 593 defines key terms used throughout the 
Regulations, and subpart D sets forth interpretive sections regarding 
the general prohibitions contained in subpart B. Transactions otherwise 
prohibited under part 593 but found to be consistent with U.S. policy 
may be authorized by one of the general licenses contained in subpart E 
or by a specific license issued pursuant to the procedures described in 
subpart E of 31 CFR part 501.
    Subpart F of part 593 refers to subpart C of part 501 for 
applicable recordkeeping and reporting requirements. Subpart G 
describes the civil and criminal penalties applicable to violations of 
the Regulations, as well as the procedures governing the potential 
imposition of a civil monetary penalty.
    Subpart H of part 593 refers to subpart D of part 501 for 
applicable provisions relating to administrative procedures. Subpart I 
of the Regulations sets forth a Paperwork Reduction Act notice.

Public Participation

    Because the Regulations involve a foreign affairs function, the 
provisions of Executive Order 12866 and the Administrative Procedure 
Act (5 U.S.C. 553) requiring notice of proposed rulemaking, opportunity 
for public participation, and delay in effective date are inapplicable.
    Because no notice of proposed rulemaking is required for this rule, 
the Regulatory Flexibility Act (5 U.S.C. 601-612) does not apply.

Paperwork Reduction Act

    The collections of information related to the Regulations are 
contained in 31 CFR part 501 (the ``Reporting, Procedures and Penalties 
Regulations''). Pursuant to the Paperwork Reduction Act of 1995 (44 
U.S.C. 3507), those collections of information have been approved by 
the Office of Management and Budget under control number 1505-0164. An 
agency may not conduct or sponsor, and a person is not required to 
respond to, a collection of information unless the collection of 
information displays a valid control number.

assets, Credit, Foreign trade, Imports, Liberia, Penalties, Reporting

Subpart A--Relation of This Part to Other Laws and Regulations


Sec.  593.101  Relation of this part to other laws and regulations.

    This part is separate from, and independent of, the other parts of 
this chapter, with the exception of part 501 of this chapter, the 
recordkeeping and reporting requirements and license application and 
other procedures of which apply to this part. Actions taken pursuant to 
part 501 of this chapter with respect to the prohibitions contained in 
this part are considered actions taken pursuant to this part. Differing 
foreign policy and national security circumstances may result in 
differing interpretations of similar language among the parts of this 
chapter. No license or authorization contained in or issued pursuant to 
any other provision of law or regulation authorizes any transaction 
prohibited by this part. No license contained in or issued pursuant to 
this part relieves the involved parties from complying with any other 
applicable laws or regulations.

Subpart B--Prohibitions


Sec.  593.201  Prohibited transactions involving blocked property.

    (a) Except as authorized by regulations, orders, directives, 
rulings, instructions, licenses or otherwise, and notwithstanding any 
contracts entered into or any license or permit granted prior to the 
effective date, property and interests in property that are in the 
United States, that hereafter come within the United States, or that 
are or hereafter come within the possession or control of U.S. persons, 
including their overseas branches, of the following persons are blocked 
and may not be transferred, paid, exported, withdrawn, or otherwise 
dealt in:
    (1) Any person listed in the Annex to Executive Order 13348 of July 
22, 2004 (69 FR 44885, July 27, 2004); and
    (2) Any person determined by the Secretary of the Treasury, in 
consultation with the Secretary of State:
    (i) To be or have been an immediate family member of Charles 
Taylor;
    (ii) To have been a senior official of the former Liberian regime 
headed by Charles Taylor or otherwise to have been or be a close ally 
or associate of Charles Taylor or the former Liberian regime;
    (iii) To have materially assisted, sponsored, or provided 
financial, material, or technological support for, or goods or services 
in support of, the unlawful depletion of Liberian resources, the 
removal of Liberian resources from that country, and the secreting of 
Liberian funds and property by any person whose property and interests 
in property are blocked pursuant to this paragraph (a); or
    (iv) To be owned or controlled by, or acting or purporting to act 
for or on behalf of, directly or indirectly, any person whose property 
and interests in property are blocked pursuant to this paragraph (a).

    Note to paragraph (a) of Sec.  593.201. The names of persons 
whose property and interests in property are blocked pursuant to 
paragraph (a) of this section are published on the Office of Foreign 
Assets Control's Specially Designated Nationals and Blocked Persons 
List (the ``SDN List''), which is accessible via the Office of 
Foreign Assets Control's Web site, announced in the Federal 
Register, and incorporated on an ongoing basis with the identifier 
[LIBERIA] into Appendix A to 31 CFR chapter V. In addition, section 
203 of the International Emergency Economic Powers Act (50 U.S.C. 
1701-1706) (``IEEPA'') explicitly authorizes the blocking of 
property and interests in property of a person or entity during the 
pendency of an investigation. The names of such persons also are 
published on the SDN List, announced in the Federal Register, and 
incorporated on an ongoing basis with the identifier [BPI-LIBERIA] 
into Appendix A to 31 CFR chapter V. Sections 501.806 and 501.807 of 
this chapter V describe the procedures to be followed by persons 
seeking, respectively, the unblocking of funds that they believe 
were blocked due to mistaken identity, or administrative 
reconsideration of their listing or designation pursuant to Sec.  
593.201(a).

    (b) The blocking of property and interests in property pursuant to 
Sec.  593.201(a) includes, but is not limited to, the prohibition of 
the making or receiving by a United States person of any contribution 
or provision of funds, goods, or services by, to, or for the benefit of 
a person whose property and interests in property are blocked pursuant 
to Sec.  593.201(a).
    (c) Unless otherwise authorized by this part or by a specific 
license expressly referring to this section, any dealing in any 
security (or evidence thereof) held within the possession or control of 
a U.S. person and either registered or inscribed in the name of, or 
known to be held for the benefit of, or issued by, any person whose 
property and interests in property are blocked pursuant to Sec.  
593.201(a) is prohibited. This prohibition includes but is not limited 
to the transfer (including the transfer on the books of any issuer or 
agent thereof), disposition, transportation, importation, exportation, 
or withdrawal of, or the endorsement or guaranty of signatures on, any 
such security on or after the effective date. This prohibition applies 
irrespective of the fact that at any time (whether prior to, on, or 
subsequent to the effective date) the registered or inscribed owner of 
any such security may have or might appear to have assigned, 
transferred, or otherwise disposed of the security.


Sec.  593.202  Effect of transfers violating the provisions of this 
part.

    (a) Any transfer after the effective date that is in violation of 
any provision of this part or of any regulation, order, directive, 
ruling, instruction, or license issued pursuant to this part, and that 
involves any property or interest in property blocked pursuant to Sec.  
593.201(a), is null and void and shall

[[Page 28858]]

not be the basis for the assertion or recognition of any interest in or 
right, remedy, power, or privilege with respect to such property or 
property interests.
    (b) No transfer before the effective date shall be the basis for 
the assertion or recognition of any right, remedy, power, or privilege 
with respect to, or any interest in, any property or interest in 
property blocked pursuant to Sec.  593.201(a), unless the person with 
whom such property is held or maintained, prior to that date, had 
written notice of the transfer or by any written evidence had 
recognized such transfer.
    (c) Unless otherwise provided, an appropriate license or other 
authorization issued by or pursuant to the direction or authorization 
of the Director of the Office of Foreign Assets Control before, during, 
or after a transfer shall validate such transfer or make it enforceable 
to the same extent that it would be valid or enforceable but for the 
provisions of IEEPA, Executive Order 13348, this part, and any 
regulation, order, directive, ruling, instruction, or license issued 
pursuant to this part.
    (d) Transfers of property that otherwise would be null and void or 
unenforceable by virtue of the provisions of this section shall not be 
deemed to be null and void or unenforceable as to any person with whom 
such property is or was held or maintained (and as to such person only) 
in cases in which such person is able to establish to the satisfaction 
of the Director of the Office of Foreign Assets Control each of the 
following:
    (1) Such transfer did not represent a willful violation of the 
provisions of this part by the person with whom such property is or was 
held or maintained;
    (2) The person with whom such property is or was held or maintained 
did not have reasonable cause to know or suspect, in view of all the 
facts and circumstances known or available to such person, that such 
transfer required a license or authorization issued pursuant to this 
part and was not so licensed or authorized, or, if a license or 
authorization did purport to cover the transfer, that such license or 
authorization had been obtained by misrepresentation of a third party 
or withholding of material facts or was otherwise fraudulently 
obtained; and
    (3) The person with whom such property is or was held or maintained 
filed with the Office of Foreign Assets Control a report setting forth 
in full the circumstances relating to such transfer promptly upon 
discovery that:
    (i) Such transfer was in violation of the provisions of this part 
or any regulation, ruling, instruction, license, or other direction or 
authorization issued pursuant to this part;
    (ii) Such transfer was not licensed or authorized by the Director 
of the Office of Foreign Assets Control; or
    (iii) If a license did purport to cover the transfer, such license 
had been obtained by misrepresentation of a third party or withholding 
of material facts or was otherwise fraudulently obtained.

    Note to paragraph (d) of Sec.  593.202. The filing of a report 
in accordance with the provisions of paragraph (d)(3) of this 
section shall not be deemed evidence that the terms of paragraphs 
(d)(1) and (d)(2) of this section have been satisfied.

    (e) Except to the extent otherwise provided by law, unless licensed 
pursuant to this part, any attachment, judgment, decree, lien, 
execution, garnishment, or other judicial process is null and void with 
respect to any property in which, on or since the effective date, there 
existed an interest of a person whose property and interests in 
property are blocked pursuant to Sec.  593.201(a).


Sec.  593.203  Holding of blocked funds in interest-bearing accounts; 
investment and reinvestment.

    (a) Except as provided in paragraph (c) or (d) of this section, or 
as otherwise directed by the Office of Foreign Assets Control, any U.S. 
person holding funds, such as currency, bank deposits, or liquidated 
financial obligations, subject to Sec.  593.201(a) shall hold or place 
such funds in a blocked interest-bearing account located in the United 
States.
    (b)(1) For purposes of this section, the term blocked interest-
bearing account means a blocked account:
    (i) In a federally-insured U.S. bank, thrift institution, or credit 
union, provided the funds are earning interest at rates that are 
commercially reasonable; or
    (ii) With a broker or dealer registered with the Securities and 
Exchange Commission under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 (15 
U.S.C. 78a et seq.), provided the funds are invested in a money market 
fund or in U.S. Treasury bills.
    (2) For purposes of this section, a rate is commercially reasonable 
if it is the rate currently offered to other depositors on deposits or 
instruments of comparable size and maturity.
    (3) Funds held or placed in a blocked account pursuant to this 
paragraph (b) may not be invested in instruments the maturity of which 
exceeds 180 days. If interest is credited to a separate blocked account 
or subaccount, the name of the account party on each account must be 
the same.
    (c) Blocked funds held in instruments the maturity of which exceeds 
180 days at the time the funds become subject to Sec.  593.201(a) may 
continue to be held until maturity in the original instrument, provided 
any interest, earnings, or other proceeds derived therefrom are paid 
into a blocked interest-bearing account in accordance with paragraph 
(b) or (d) of this section.
    (d) Blocked funds held in accounts or instruments outside the 
United States at the time the funds become subject to Sec.  593.201(a) 
may continue to be held in the same type of accounts or instruments, 
provided the funds earn interest at rates that are commercially 
reasonable.
    (e) This section does not create an affirmative obligation for the 
holder of blocked tangible property, such as chattels or real estate, 
or of other blocked property, such as debt or equity securities, to 
sell or liquidate such property at the time the property becomes 
subject to Sec.  593.201(a). However, the Office of Foreign Assets 
Control may issue licenses permitting or directing such sales in 
appropriate cases.
    (f) Funds subject to this section may not be held, invested, or 
reinvested in a manner that provides immediate financial or economic 
benefit or access to any person whose property and interests in 
property are blocked pursuant to Sec.  593.201(a), nor may their holder 
cooperate in or facilitate the pledging or other attempted use as 
collateral of blocked funds or other assets.


Sec.  593.204  Expenses of maintaining blocked physical property; 
liquidation of blocked account.

    (a) Except as otherwise authorized, and notwithstanding the 
existence of any rights or obligations conferred or imposed by any 
international agreement or contract entered into or any license or 
permit granted prior to the effective date, all expenses incident to 
the maintenance of physical property blocked pursuant to Sec.  
593.201(a) shall be the responsibility of the owners or operators of 
such property, which expenses shall not be met from blocked funds.
    (b) Property blocked pursuant to Sec.  593.201(a) may, in the

writing or document knowing the same to contain any materially false, 
fictitious or fraudulent statement or entry, shall be fined under title 
18, United States Code, or imprisoned not more than five years, or 
both.
    (f) Violations of this part may also be subject to relevant 
provisions of other applicable laws.


Sec.  593.702  Prepenalty notice.

    (a) When required. If the Director of the Office of Foreign Assets 
Control has reason to believe that there has occurred a violation of 
any provision of this part or a violation of the provisions of any 
license, ruling, regulation, order, direction, or instruction issued by 
or pursuant to the direction or

[[Page 28863]]

authorization of the Secretary of the Treasury pursuant to this part or 
otherwise under IEEPA, and the Director determines that further 
proceedings are warranted, the Director shall notify the alleged 
violator of the agency's intent to impose a monetary penalty by issuing 
a prepenalty notice. The prepenalty notice shall be in writing. The 
prepenalty notice may be issued whether or not another agency has taken 
any action with respect to the matter.
    (b) Contents of notice.--(1) Facts of violation. The prepenalty 
notice shall describe the violation, specify the laws and regulations 
allegedly violated, and state the amount of the proposed monetary 
penalty.
    (2) Right to respond. The prepenalty notice also shall inform the 
respondent of the respondent's right to make a written presentation 
within the applicable 30-day period set forth in Sec.  593.703 as to 
why a monetary penalty should not be imposed or why, if imposed, the 
monetary penalty should be in a lesser amount than proposed.
    (c) Informal settlement prior to issuance of prepenalty notice. At 
any time prior to the issuance of a prepenalty notice, an alleged 
violator may request in writing that, for a period not to exceed 60 
days, the agency withhold issuance of the prepenalty notice for the 
exclusive purpose of effecting settlement of the agency's potential 
civil monetary penalty claims. In the event the Director grants the 
request, under terms and conditions within the Director's discretion, 
the Office of Foreign Assets Control will agree to withhold issuance of 
the prepenalty notice for a period not to exceed 60 days and will enter 
into settlement negotiations of the potential civil monetary penalty 
claim.


Sec.  593.703  Response to prepenalty notice; informal settlement.

    (a) Deadline for response. The respondent may submit a response to 
the prepenalty notice within the applicable 30-day period set forth in 
this paragraph. The Director may grant, at the Director's discretion, 
an extension of time in which to submit a response to the prepenalty 
notice. The failure to submit a response within the applicable time 
period set forth in this paragraph shall be deemed to be a waiver of 
the right to respond.
    (1) Computation of time for response. A response to the prepenalty 
notice must be postmarked or date-stamped by the U.S. Postal Service 
(or foreign postal service, if mailed abroad) or courier service 
provider (if transmitted to the Office of Foreign Assets Control by 
courier) on or before the 30th day after the postmark date on the 
envelope in which the prepenalty notice was mailed. If the prepenalty 
notice was personally delivered to the respondent by a non-U.S. Postal 
Service agent authorized by the Director, a response must be postmarked 
or date-stamped on or before the 30th day after the date of delivery.
    (2) Extensions of time for response. If a due date falls on a 
Federal holiday or weekend, that due date is extended to include the 
following business day. Any other extensions of time will be granted, 
at the Director's discretion, only upon the respondent's specific 
request to the Office of Foreign Assets Control.
    (b) Form and method of response. The response need not be in any 
particular form, but it must be typewritten and signed by the 
respondent or a representative thereof. A copy of the written response 
may be sent by facsimile, but the original also must be sent to the 
Office of Foreign Assets Control Civil Penalties Division by mail or 
courier and must be postmarked or date-stamped, in accordance with 
paragraph (a) of this section.
    (c) Contents of response. A written response must contain 
information sufficient to indicate that it is in response to the 
prepenalty notice and must identify the Office of Foreign Assets 
Control identification number listed on the prepenalty notice.
    (1) A written response must include the respondent's full name, 
address, telephone number, and facsimile number, if available, or those 
of the representative of the respondent.
    (2) A written response should either admit or deny each specific 
violation alleged in the prepenalty notice and also state if the 
respondent has no knowledge of a particular violation. If the written 
response fails to address any specific violation alleged in the 
prepenalty notice, that alleged violation shall be deemed to be 
admitted.
    (3) A written response should include any information in defense, 
evidence in support of an asserted defense, or other factors that the 
respondent requests the Office of Foreign Assets Control to consider. 
Any defense or explanation previously made to the Office of Foreign 
Assets Control or any other agency must be repeated in the written 
response. Any defense not raised in the written response will be 
considered waived. The written response also should set forth the 
reasons why the respondent believes the penalty should not be imposed 
or why, if imposed, it should be in a lesser amount than proposed.
    (d) Failure to Respond. If the Office of Foreign Assets Control 
receives no response to a prepenalty notice within the applicable time 
period set forth in paragraph (a) of this section, a penalty notice 
generally will be issued, taking into account the mitigating and/or 
aggravating factors present in the record. If there are no mitigating 
factors present in the record, or the record contains a preponderance 
of aggravating factors, the proposed prepenalty amount generally will 
be assessed as the final penalty.
    (e) Informal settlement. In addition to or as an alternative to a 
written response to a prepenalty notice, the respondent or respondent's 
representative may contact the Office of Foreign Assets Control's Civil 
Penalties Division as advised in the prepenalty notice to propose the 
settlement of allegations contained in the prepenalty notice and 
related matters. However, the requirements set forth in paragraph (g) 
of this section as to oral communication by the representative must 
first be fulfilled. In the event of settlement at the prepenalty stage, 
the claim proposed in the prepenalty notice will be withdrawn, the 
respondent will not be required to take a written position on 
allegations contained in the prepenalty notice, and the Office of 
Foreign Assets Control will make no final determination as to whether a 
violation occurred. The amount accepted in settlement of allegations in 
a prepenalty notice may vary from the civil penalty that might finally 
be imposed in the event of a formal determination of violation. In the 
event no settlement is reached, the time limit specified in paragraph 
(a) of this section for written response to the prepenalty notice will 
remain in effect unless additional time is granted by the Office of 
Foreign Assets Control.
    (f) Guidelines. Guidelines for the imposition or settlement of 
civil penalties by the Office of Foreign Assets Control are available 
on OFAC's Web site (<A HREF="http://frwebgate.access.gpo.gov/cgi-bin/leaving.cgi?from=leavingFR.html&log=linklog&to=http://www.treas.gov/ofac">http://www.treas.gov/ofac</A>).

    (g) Representation. A representative of the respondent may act on 
behalf of the respondent, but any oral communication with the Office of 
Foreign Assets Control prior to a written submission regarding the 
specific allegations contained in the prepenalty notice must be 
preceded by a written letter of representation, unless the prepenalty 
notice was served upon the respondent in care of the representative.


Sec.  593.704  Penalty imposition or withdrawal.

    (a) No violation. If, after considering any response to the 
prepenalty notice and any relevant facts, the Director of the Office of 
Foreign Assets Control determines that there was no violation

[[Page 28864]]

by the respondent named in the prepenalty notice, the Director shall 
notify the respondent in writing of that determination and of the 
cancellation of the proposed monetary penalty.
    (b) Violation. (1) If, after considering any written response to 
the prepenalty notice, or default in the submission of a written 
response, and any relevant facts, the Director of the Office of Foreign 
Assets Control determines that there was a violation by the respondent 
named in the prepenalty notice, the Director is authorized to issue a 
written penalty notice to the respondent of the determination of the 
violation and the imposition of the monetary penalty.
    (2) The penalty notice shall inform the respondent that payment or 
arrangement for installment payment of the assessed penalty must be 
made within 30 days of the date of mailing of the penalty notice by the 
Office of Foreign Assets Control.
    (3) The penalty notice shall inform the respondent of the 
requirement to furnish the respondent's taxpayer identification number 
pursuant to 31 U.S.C. 7701 and that such number will be used for 
purposes of collecting and reporting on any delinquent penalty amount.
    (4) The issuance of the penalty notice finding a violation and 
imposing a monetary penalty shall constitute final agency action. The 
respondent has the right to seek judicial review of that final agency 
action in Federal district court.


Sec.  593.705  Administrative collection; referral to United States 
Department of Justice.

    In the event that the respondent does not pay the penalty imposed 
pursuant to this part or make payment arrangements acceptable to the 
Director of the Office of Foreign Assets Control within 30 days of the 
date of mailing of the penalty notice, the matter may be referred for 
administrative collection measures by the Department of the Treasury or 
to the United States Department of Justice for appropriate action to 
recover the penalty in a civil suit in a Federal district court.
