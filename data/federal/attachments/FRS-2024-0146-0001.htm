Board is directed to take every reasonable step to solicit comment. In 
determining whether to approve a collection of information, the Board 
will consider all comments received from the public and other agencies.
    During the comment period for this proposal, a copy of the proposed 
PRA OMB submission, including the draft reporting form and 
instructions, supporting statement (which contains more detail about 
the information collection and burden estimates than this notice), and 
other documentation, will be made available on the Board's public

Request for Comment on Information Collection Proposal

    The Board invites public comment on the following information 
collection, which is being reviewed under authority delegated by the 
OMB under the PRA. Comments are invited on the following:
    a. Whether the proposed collection of information is necessary for 
the proper performance of the Board's functions, including whether the 
information has practical utility;
    b. The accuracy of the Board's estimate of the burden of the 
proposed information collection, including the validity of the 
methodology and assumptions used;
    c. Ways to enhance the quality, utility, and clarity of the 
information to be collected;
    d. Ways to minimize the burden of information collection on 
respondents, including through the use of automated collection 
techniques or other forms of information technology; and

maintenance, and purchase of services to provide information.
    At the end of the comment period, the comments and recommendations 
received will be analyzed to determine the extent to which the Board 
should modify the proposal.

Proposal Under OMB Delegated Authority To Extend for Three Years, 
Without Revision, the Following Information Collection

    Collection title: Reporting, Recordkeeping, and Disclosure 
Requirements Associated with the CFPB's Home Mortgage Disclosure Act 
Loan/Application Register Required by Regulation C.
    Collection identifier: FR HMDA LAR.
    OMB control number: 7100-0247.
    General description of collection: The Home Mortgage Disclosure Act 
(HMDA) was enacted in 1975 and is implemented by Regulation C. 
Generally, the HMDA requires certain depository and non-depository 
institutions that make certain mortgage loans to collect, report, and 
disclose data about originations and purchases of mortgage loans, as 
well as loan applications that do not result in originations (for 
example, applications that are denied or withdrawn).
    The FR HMDA LAR is the Board's information collection associated 
with the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau's (CFPB's) Regulation C. 
The FR HMDA LAR is used to (1) help determine whether financial 
institutions are serving the housing needs of their communities, (2) 
assist public officials in distributing public-sector investments so as 
to attract private investment to areas where it is needed, and (3) 
assist in identifying possible discriminatory lending patterns and 
enforcing anti-discrimination statutes.
    Frequency: Quarterly and annually.
    Respondents: Except those that are supervised by the CFPB: state 
member banks, their subsidiaries, subsidiaries of bank holding 
companies, subsidiaries of savings and loan holding companies, U.S. 
branches and agencies of foreign banks (other than federal branches, 
federal agencies, and insured state branches of foreign banks), 
commercial lending companies owned or controlled by foreign banks, and 
organizations operating under section 25 or 25A of the Federal Reserve 
Act (12 U.S.C. 601-604a; 611-631).
    Total estimated number of respondents: 654.
    Total estimated annual burden hours: 960,235.

    Board of Governors of the Federal Reserve System, June 4, 2024.
Benjamin W. McDonough,
Deputy Secretary and Ombuds of the Board.
