SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION: EXIM's borrowers, financial institution 
policy holders and guaranteed lenders provide this form to U.S. 
exporters, who certify to the eligibility of their exports for EXIM 
support. For direct loans and loan guarantees, the completed form is 
required to be submitted at time of disbursement and held by either the 
guaranteed lender or EXIM. For MT insurance, the completed forms are 
held by the financial institution, only to be submitted to EXIM in the 
event of a claim filing. EXIM uses the referenced form to obtain 
information from exporters regarding the export transaction and content 
sourcing. These details are necessary to determine the value and 
legitimacy of EXIM financing support and claims submitted. It also 
provides the financial institutions a check on the export transaction's 
eligibility at the time it is fulfilling a financing request.
