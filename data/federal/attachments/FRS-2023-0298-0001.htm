Final Approval Under OMB Delegated Authority of the Extension for Three 
Years, Without Revision, of the Following Information Collection

    Collection title: Reporting Requirements Associated with Regulation 
XX.
    Collection identifier: FR XX.
    OMB control number: 7100-0363.
    General description of collection: The Board's Regulation XX--
Concentration Limit (12 CFR part 251) implements section 14 of the Bank 
Holding Company Act of 1956 (BHC Act), which establishes a financial 
sector concentration limit that generally prohibits a financial company 
from merging or consolidating with, or otherwise acquiring, another 
company if the resulting company's liabilities upon consummation would 
exceed 10 percent of the aggregate liabilities of all financial 
companies (a covered acquisition). Under section 14 of the BHC Act and 
Regulation XX, a financial company means (1) an insured depository 
institution, (2) a bank holding company, (3) a savings and loan holding 
company, (4) any other company that controls an insured depository 
institution, (5) a nonbank financial company designated by the 
Financial Stability Oversight Council (Council) for supervision by the 
Board, or (6) a foreign bank or company that is treated as a bank 
holding company for purposes of the BHC Act. Regulation XX includes 
certain reporting requirements that apply to financial companies 
(sections 251.3(e), 251.4(b), and 251.4(c)). In addition, section 251.6 
of Regulation XX requires financial companies that do not report 
consolidated financial information to the Board or other appropriate 
Federal banking agency to report information on their total 
liabilities; the Board has implemented this requirement through the 
Financial Company (as defined) Report of Consolidated Liabilities (FR 
XX-1).
    Frequency: Event-generated, annual.
    Respondents: Financial companies.
    Total estimated number of respondents: 35.
    Total estimated annual burden hours: 97.\1\
