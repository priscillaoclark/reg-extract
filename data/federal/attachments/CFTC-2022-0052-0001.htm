SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION: The AAC was established to assist the 
Commission in assessing issues affecting agricultural producers; 
consumers; processors; lenders; other major market participants, 
including derivatives intermediaries, buy-side representatives, and 
exchanges; regulators, and others interested in or affected by the 
agricultural derivatives markets through public meetings and Committee 
reports and recommendations. The duties of the AAC are solely advisory 
and include calling for reports and/or recommendations by the AAC or 
AAC subcommittee(s), adopting reports and/or recommendations, 
transmitting reports to the Commission, and making recommendations to 
the Commission. Determinations of actions to be taken and policy to be 
expressed with respect to the reports or recommendations of the AAC are 
made solely by the Commission.
    AAC members generally serve as representatives and provide advice 
reflecting the views of organizations and entities that constitute the 
structure of the agricultural derivatives markets. Depending on the 
issues faced, the Commission may, from time to time, appoint experts to 
serve as Special Government Employees (SGEs), or officials of other 
Federal agencies to serve, on the AAC. If nominated, SGEs will be asked 
to submit and complete a Confidential Financial Disclosure Report (OGE 
Form 450). Historically, the AAC has had between 30-40 members 
representing the following viewpoint categories: (i) agricultural 
producers and/or direct and indirect users/consumers of agricultural 
products; (ii) providers of agricultural credit; (iii) other major 
market participants, including derivatives intermediaries, buy-side 
representatives, and exchanges; (iv) regulators or representatives from 
other relevant government agencies; and (v) academia or public interest 
groups. The AAC has held approximately one meeting per year. AAC 
members serve at the pleasure of the Commission. In addition, AAC 
members do not receive compensation or honoraria for their services, 
and they are not reimbursed for travel and per diem expenses.
    The Commission seeks members who represent organizations or groups 
with an interest in the AAC's mission and function and reflect a 
balanced and representative sample of agricultural producers; 
consumers; processors; lenders; other major market participants, 
including derivatives intermediaries, buy-side representatives, and 
exchanges; regulators, and others interested in or affected by the 
agricultural derivatives markets. To advise the Commission effectively, 
AAC members must have a high-level of expertise and experience in the 
agricultural derivatives markets and the Commission's regulation of 
such markets, including from a historical perspective. To the extent 
practicable, the Commission will strive to select members reflecting 
wide ethnic, racial, gender, and age representation. AAC members should 
be open to participating in a public forum.
    The Commission invites the submission of nominations for AAC 
membership. Each nomination submission should include relevant 
information about the proposed member, such as the individual's name, 
title, and organizational affiliation, as well as information that 
supports the individual's qualifications to serve on the AAC. The 
submission should also include suggestions for topics for discussion at 
future AAC meetings as well as the name and email or mailing address of 
the person nominating the proposed member.
    Submission of a nomination is not a guarantee of selection as a 
member of the AAC. As noted in the AAC's Membership Balance Plan, the 
CFTC identifies members for the AAC through a variety of methods. Such 
methods may include public requests for nominations for membership; 
recommendations sought from existing advisory committee members; 
consultations with knowledgeable persons outside the CFTC (agricultural 
producers, consumer groups, other market participants, state or Federal 
government agencies, academia, etc.); requests to be represented 
received from individuals and organizations; and Commissioners' and 
CFTC staff's professional knowledge of those experienced in the 
agricultural derivatives markets.
    The office of the Commissioner primarily responsible for the AAC 
plays a primary, but not exclusive, role in this process and makes 
recommendations regarding membership to the Commission. The Commission, 
by vote, authorizes proposed members to serve on the AAC.
    The Commission also invites submissions from the public regarding 
the topics on which the AAC should focus. In other words, topics that:
    (a) Reflect matters of public concern to agricultural derivatives 
markets, such as contract design, hedging effectiveness, price 
discovery, customer protection, the role of intermediaries, exchange 
rules; and/or
    (b) Are important to otherwise assist the Commission in identifying 
and understanding the impact and implications of the evolving market 
structure of the agricultural derivatives markets.

    Each topic submission should include the commenter's name and email 
or mailing address.
