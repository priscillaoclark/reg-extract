``blanket routine uses'' last published on March 14, 2001 at 76 FR 5973 
and incorporates the routine uses that apply to the records maintained 
in CFTC-32. This modification updates and clarifies the Privacy Act 
exemptions promulgated for this system, and also makes conforming 
changes to align with format requirements in OMB Circular A-108, 
Federal Agency Responsibilities for Review, Reporting, and Publication 
under the Privacy Act.

SYSTEM NAME AND NUMBER:
    Office of the Inspector General Investigative Files; CFTC-32.

SECURITY CLASSIFICATION:
    Unclassified.

SYSTEM LOCATION:
    Office of the Inspector General, Commodity Futures Trading 
Commission, Three Lafayette Centre, 1155 21st Street NW, Washington, DC 
20581. The system will be hosted on a cloud and data center computing 
infrastructure. Duplicate versions of some or all system information 
may be at satellite locations where the CFTC has granted direct access 
to support CFTC operations, system backup, emergency preparedness, and/
or continuity of operations.

SYSTEM MANAGER(S):
    Inspector General, Office of the Inspector General, Commodity 
Futures Trading Commission, Three Lafayette Centre, 1155 21st Street 
NW, Washington, DC 20581, <a href="/cdn-cgi/l/email-protection#0847414f486b6e7c6b266f677e"><span class="__cf_email__" data-cfemail="5c13151b1c3f3a283f723b332a">[email&#160;protected]</span></a>.

AUTHORITY FOR MAINTENANCE OF THE SYSTEM:
    Commodity Exchange Act, 7 U.S.C. 1 et seq., and regulations, rules 
or orders issued thereunder; Public Law 95-452, as amended, 5 U.S.C. 
app. 3.

PURPOSE(S) OF THE SYSTEM:
    The purpose of this system is to enable the Office of the Inspector 
General to effectively and efficiently intake allegations and conduct 
investigations relating to the programs and operations of the CFTC.

CATEGORIES OF INDIVIDUALS COVERED BY THE SYSTEM:
    Individuals who are part of an allegation or investigation of fraud 
and abuse concerning Commission programs or operations.

CATEGORIES OF RECORDS IN THE SYSTEM:
    This system includes all allegations, all correspondence relevant 
to the investigation; all internal staff memoranda, copies of all 
subpoenas issued during the investigation, affidavits, statement from 
witnesses, transcripts of testimony taken in the investigation and 
accompanying exhibits; documents and records or copies obtained during 
the investigation; incoming allegations and allegation development, 
opening reports, progress reports and closing reports; records 
documenting allegation and investigation file status.

RECORD SOURCE CATEGORIES:
    Information in these records is supplied by: Individuals including, 
where practicable, those to whom the information relates; witnesses, 
corporations and other entities; records of individuals and of the 
Commission; records of other entities; Federal, foreign, State or local 
bodies and law enforcement agencies; documents, correspondence relating 
to litigation, and transcripts of testimony; miscellaneous other 
sources including other nongovernmental sources and open source 
intelligence, including web-based communities, user-generated content, 
social-networking sites, wikis, blogs and news sources maintained on 
the Surface, Deep, and Dark web. The Surface Web is what users access 
in their regular day-to-day activity. It is available to the general 
public using standard search engines and can be accessed using standard 
web browsers that do not require any special configuration. The Deep 
Web is the portion of the web that is not indexed or searchable by 
ordinary search engines. The Dark Web is a less accessible subset of 
the Deep Web that relies on connections made between trusted peers and 
requires specialized software, tools, or equipment to access.

investigation, individual investigated, or by case file number.

POLICIES AND PRACTICES FOR RETENTION AND DISPOSAL OF RECORDS:

interest as reflected in widespread news media attention, Congressional 
interest, and/or market participant inquiries are considered permanent

is closed.

ADMINISTRATIVE, TECHNICAL, AND PHYSICAL SAFEGUARDS:
    Administrative safeguards include restricting access to the OIG 
work area, and restricting relevant investigative tasks to only those

annual security and privacy, and records management training. Technical 
security measures within CFTC include restrictions on computer access 
to authorized individuals who have a legitimate need to know the 
information; required use of strong passwords; multi-factor 
authentication for access to some CFTC

network components; use of encryption for certain data types and 
transfers; firewalls and intrusion detection applications; and regular 
review of security procedures and best practices to enhance security. 
Physical safeguards include restrictions on building access to 
authorized individuals, 24-hour security guard service, and maintenance 
of records in lockable offices and filing cabinets.
