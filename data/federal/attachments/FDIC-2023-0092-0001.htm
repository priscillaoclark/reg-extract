    General Description of Collection: The 1975 Amendments to the 
Securities Exchange Act of 1934 established a comprehensive framework 
for the regulation of the activities of municipal securities dealers. 
Under section 15B(a) of the Securities Exchange Act, municipal 
securities dealers which are banks, or separately identifiable 
departments or divisions of banks engaging in municipal securities 
activities, are required to be registered with the Securities and 
Exchange Commission in accordance with such rules as the Municipal 
Securities Rulemaking Board (MSRB), a rulemaking authority established 
by the 1975 Amendments, may prescribe as necessary or appropriate in 
the public interest or for the protection of investors. One of the 
areas in which the Act directed the MSRB to promulgate rules is the 
qualifications of persons associated with municipal securities dealers 
as municipal securities principals and municipal securities 
representatives. The MSRB Rules require persons who are or seek to be 
associated with municipal securities dealers as municipal securities 
principals or municipal securities representatives to provide certain 
background information and conversely, require the municipal securities 
dealers to obtain the information from such persons. Generally, the 
information required to be furnished relates to employment history and 
professional background including any disciplinary sanctions and any 
claimed bases for exemption from MSRB examination requirements. The 
FDIC and the other two Federal bank regulatory agencies, the 
Comptroller of the Currency, and the Federal Reserve Board, have 
prescribed Forms MSD-4 to satisfy these requirements and have 
prescribed Form MSD-5 for notification by a bank municipal securities 
dealer that a municipal securities principal's or a municipal 
securities representative's association with the dealer has terminated 
and the reason for such termination. State nonmember banks and state 
savings associations that are municipal security dealers submit these 
forms, as applicable, to the FDIC as their appropriate regulatory 
agency for each person associated with the dealer as a municipal 
securities principal or municipal securities representative. There is 
no change in the methodology or substance of this information 
collection. This reduction in estimated annual burden (from 4 hours in 
2021 to 2 hours currently) is due to the decrease in the estimated 
number of respondents.

    OMB Number: 3064-0137.
    Affected Public: Insured state nonmember banks and state savings 
associations.

    General Description of Collection: The Interagency Guidance on 
Asset Securitization Activities informs bankers and examiners of safe 
and sound practices regarding asset Securitization. The information 
collections contained in the Interagency Guidance are needed by 
institutions to manage their asset Securitization activities in a safe 
and sound manner. Bank management uses this information as the basis 
for the safe and sound operation of their asset securitization 
activities and to ensure that they minimize operational risk in these 
activities. There is no change in the method or substance of the 
information collection. The 94-hour increase in estimated annual burden 
(from 263 hours in 2021 to 357 hours currently) is the result of 
economic fluctuation. In particular, the number of respondents has 
increased while the reporting frequency and the estimated time per 
response remain the same.

Complex Structured Finance Transactions.

    General Description of Collection: The Interagency Statement on 
Sound Practices Concerning Complex Structured Finance Transactions 
describes the types of internal controls and risk management procedures 
that the Agencies believe are particularly effective in assisting 
financial institutions to identify, evaluate, assess, document, and 
control the full range of credit, market, operational, legal and 
reputational risks. A financial institution that engages in complex 
structured finance transactions should maintain a set of formal, 
written, firmwide policies and procedures that are designed to allow 
the institution to identify and assess these risks. There is no change 
in the methodology or substance of this information collection. The 
estimated annual burden is unchanged.

Request for Comment

    Comments are invited on: (a) Whether the collections of information 
are necessary for the proper performance of the FDIC's functions, 
including whether the information has practical utility; (b) the 
accuracy of the estimates of the burden of the information collections, 
including the validity of the methodology and assumptions used; (c) 
ways to enhance the quality, utility, and clarity of the information to 
be collected; and (d) ways to minimize the burden of the collections of 
information on respondents, including through the use of automated 
collection techniques or other forms of information technology. All 
comments will become a matter of public record.
