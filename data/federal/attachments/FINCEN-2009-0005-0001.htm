SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION:

I. Background

A. Statutory Provisions

    On October 26, 2001, the President signed into law the Uniting and=20
Strengthening America by Providing Appropriate Tools Required to=20
Intercept and Obstruct Terrorism (``USA PATRIOT ACT'') Act of 2001,=20
Public Law 107-56 (``the Act''). Title III of the Act amends the anti-
money laundering provisions of the Bank Secrecy Act, codified at 12=20
U.S.C. 1829b and 1951-1959 and 31 U.S.C. 5311-5314 and 5316-5332, to=20
promote the prevention, detection, and prosecution of international=20
money laundering and the financing of terrorism. Regulations=20
implementing the BSA appear at 31 CFR part 103. The authority of the=20
Secretary of the Treasury (``the Secretary'') to administer the BSA has=20
been delegated to the Director of FinCEN.
    Of the Act's many goals, the facilitation of information sharing=20
among governmental entities and financial institutions for the purpose=20
of combating terrorism and money laundering is of paramount importance.=20
Section 314 of the Act furthers this goal by providing for the sharing=20
of information between the government and financial institutions, and=20
among financial institutions themselves. As with many other provisions=20
of the Act, Congress has charged the U.S. Department of the Treasury=20
with developing regulations to implement these information-sharing=20
provisions.

[[Page 58927]]

    Subsection 314(a) of the Act states in part that:

    [t]he Secretary shall * * * adopt regulations to encourage=20
further cooperation among financial institutions, their regulatory=20
authorities, and law enforcement authorities, with the specific=20
purpose of encouraging regulatory authorities and law enforcement=20
authorities to share with financial institutions information=20
regarding individuals, entities, and organizations engaged in or=20
reasonably suspected based on credible evidence of engaging in=20
terrorist acts or money laundering activities.

B. Overview of the Current Regulatory Provisions Regarding the 314(a)=20
Program

    On September 26, 2002, FinCEN published a final rule implementing=20
the authority contained in section 314(a) of the Act.\1\ That rule=20
(``the 314(a) rule'') allows FinCEN to require U.S. financial=20
institutions to search their records to determine whether they have=20
maintained an account or conducted a transaction with a person that a=20
Federal law enforcement agency has certified is suspected based on=20
credible evidence of engaging in terrorist activity or money=20
laundering.\2\ Before processing a request from a Federal law=20
enforcement agency, FinCEN also requires the requesting agency to=20
certify that, in the case of money laundering, the matter is=20
significant, and that the requesting agency has been unable to locate=20
the information sought through traditional methods of investigation and=20
analysis before attempting to use this authority (``the 314(a)=20
program'').

-------------------------------------------------------------------------=

    Since its inception, the 314(a) program has yielded significant=20
investigative benefits to Federal law enforcement users in terrorist=20
financing and major money laundering cases. Feedback from the=20
requesters and illustrations from sample case studies consistently=20
demonstrate how useful the program is in enhancing the scope and=20
expanding the universe of investigations. In view of the proven success=20
of the 314(a) program, FinCEN seeks to broaden access to the program as=20
outlined in the following paragraphs.

C. Objectives of Proposed Changes

a. Allowing Certain Foreign Law Enforcement Agencies To Initiate 314(a)=20
Queries
    In order to satisfy the United States' treaty obligation with=20
certain foreign governments, FinCEN is proposing to extend the use of=20
the 314(a) program to include foreign law enforcement agencies. On June=20
25, 2003, the Agreement on Mutual Legal Assistance between the United=20
States and the European Union (EU) (hereinafter, the ``U.S.-EU MLAT'')=20
was signed. Between 2004 and 2006, twenty-five bilateral implementing=20
agreements also were signed by the United States and EU Member States.=20
In 2006, the U.S.-EU MLAT, along with twenty-five bilateral=20
instruments, was submitted to the U.S. Senate for its advice and=20
consent to ratification. An additional two bilateral instruments, with=20
Romania and Bulgaria, were concluded and submitted to the Senate in=20
2007, following those countries' accession to the EU. The U.S.-EU MLAT=20
and all twenty-seven bilateral instruments were ratified by the=20
President on September 23, 2008, upon the advice and consent of the=20
U.S. Senate.
    Article 4 of the U.S.-EU MLAT (entitled ``Identification of Bank=20
Information'') obligates a requested Signatory State to search on a=20
centralized basis for bank accounts within its territory that may be=20
important to a criminal investigation in the requesting Signatory=20
State. Article 4 also contemplates that Signatory States may search for=20
information in the possession of a non-bank financial institution.=20
Under Article 4, a Signatory State receiving a request may limit the=20
scope of its obligation to provide assistance to terrorist activity and=20
money laundering offenses, and many did so in their respective=20
bilateral instruments with the United States. In addition, Article 4=20
makes clear that the United States and the EU are under an obligation=20
to ensure that the application of Article 4 does not impose=20
extraordinary burdens on States that receive search requests. Certain=20
EU States are expected to accommodate search requests from the United=20
States by querying a single centralized database which identifies all=20
bank accounts within that State. In negotiating the terms of Article 4,=20
the United States expressly envisioned that EU member States would be=20
able to access the information sharing process created by the=20
implementation of section 314(a) of the Act. Expanding that process to=20
include certain foreign law enforcement requesters would greatly=20
benefit the United States by granting law enforcement agencies in the=20
United States with reciprocal rights to obtain information about=20
matching accounts in EU member States.
    Foreign law enforcement agencies would be able to use the 314(a)=20
program in a way analogous to how Federal criminal law enforcement=20
agencies currently access the program. Thus, a foreign law enforcement=20
agency, prior to initiating a 314(a) query, would have to certify that,=20
in the case of a money laundering investigation, the matter is=20
significant, and that it has been unable to locate the information=20
sought through traditional methods of investigation and analysis before=20
attempting to use the 314(a) program. FinCEN also anticipates that the=20
foreign request will be screened initially by a Federal law enforcement=20
official serving as an attach[eacute] to the requesting jurisdiction.=20
The application of these internal procedures will help ensure that the=20
314(a) program is utilized only in significant situations, thereby=20
minimizing the cost on reporting financial institutions.
b. Allowing State and Local Law Enforcement Agencies To Initiate 314(a)=20
Queries
    By regulation, access to the 314(a) program currently is only=20
available to Federal law enforcement agencies. When the section 314(a)=20
rule was drafted, FinCEN considered expanding the process to include=20
requesters from other types of law enforcement agencies. However,=20
because of uncertainty about how the new information-sharing rules=20
would impact financial institutions, FinCEN ultimately decided to defer=20
expansion beyond Federal law enforcement agencies. FinCEN now has the=20
benefit of drawing upon six years of experience in administering the=20
section 314(a) rule. In that time, financial institutions have made=20
necessary adjustments to comply with these rules and have developed=20
more efficient ways to respond to section 314(a) requests.
    Money laundering and terror-related financial crimes are not=20
limited by jurisdiction or geography. Detection and deterrence of these=20
crimes require information sharing across all levels of investigative=20
authorities, to include State and local law enforcement, to ensure the=20
broadest United States Government defense.
    State and local law enforcement investigations run the gamut of=20
criminal violations, to include money laundering and to a lesser=20
extent, terrorist financing, and some of these investigations could=20
benefit from the use of the 314(a) program. Access to the 314(a)=20
program by State and local law enforcement would provide them a=20
platform from which they could more effectively and efficiently fill=20
information gaps, including those connected with multi-jurisdictional=20
financial transactions, in the same manner as Federal law enforcement=20
agencies. This expansion of the 314(a) program, in certain limited

[[Page 58928]]

circumstances, to include State and local law enforcement authorities,=20
would benefit overall efforts to ensure that all law enforcement=20
resources are made available to combat money laundering and terrorist=20
financing.
    Therefore, the proposal would broaden 314(a) access to allow State=20
and local law enforcement agencies to submit 314(a) queries. As is the=20
case currently with requesting Federal criminal law agencies, State and=20
local law enforcement, prior to initiating a 314(a) query, would have=20
to certify that, in the case of a money laundering investigation, the=20
matter is significant, and that it has been unable to locate the=20
information sought through traditional methods of investigation and=20
analysis before attempting to use the 314(a) program. The application=20
of these internal procedures will help ensure that the 314(a) program=20
will be utilized only in the most compelling situations, thereby=20
minimizing the cost incurred by reporting financial institutions.
c. Clarifying That FinCEN, on Its Own Behalf and on Behalf of=20
Appropriate Components of the Department of the Treasury, May Initiate=20
314(a) Queries
    FinCEN's statutory mandate includes working to identify possible=20
criminal activity to appropriate Federal, State, local, and foreign law=20
enforcement agencies, and to support ongoing criminal financial=20
investigations and prosecutions.\3\ FinCEN also routinely assists the=20
law enforcement community through proactive analyses to discover=20
trends, patterns, and common activity in the financial information=20
contained in BSA reports. FinCEN's use of the 314(a) program will=20
greatly enhance the scope and utility of its case support efforts=20
beyond the insights provided from the BSA data, thereby delivering=20
critical information about significant criminal activity on a timelier=20
basis. Accordingly, FinCEN would use the 314(a) program to submit self-
initiated 314(a) queries.
-------------------------------------------------------------------------=
--

    \3\ See 31 U.S.C. 310.
-------------------------------------------------------------------------=
--

    FinCEN assists law enforcement by providing advanced or specialized=20
analysis of BSA data on significant investigations involving offenses=20
of money laundering or terrorist financing. These investigations often=20
involve multiple locations or are otherwise linked to other=20
investigations. A single 314(a) request issued by FinCEN could more=20
efficiently coordinate and simultaneously support several=20
investigations, thereby eliminating the need for separate requests from=20
each investigating agency or jurisdiction.
    There also are instances in which FinCEN's analytical products will=20
benefit from access to the 314(a) program by providing a more complete=20
picture of financial transactions and mechanisms, as well as=20
interrelationships among investigative subjects and financial=20
transactions or entities. In addition, other appropriate components of=20
the Department of the Treasury that provide analytical support, such as=20
the Department's counter-terrorist financing and money laundering=20
efforts, will be better equipped to fulfill their missions when given=20
access to the 314(a) program. It is anticipated that the findings from=20
the use of the 314(a) program will reveal additional insights and=20
overall patterns of suspicious financial activities.

II. Section-by-Section Analysis

A. Section 103.90(a)

    FinCEN proposes to amend 31 CFR 103.90(a) by changing the=20
definition of the term ``money laundering'' to include activity that=20
would be criminalized by 18 U.S.C. 1956 or 1957 if such activity=20
occurred in the United States. The change would allow the term to be=20
applied to information requests by foreign law enforcement agencies.=20
State and local law enforcement requesters would be subject to the same=20
definition of money laundering that currently applies to Federal law=20
enforcement agencies--i.e., activity that is criminalized by 18 U.S.C.=20
1956 or 1957. Thus, in the case of a significant money laundering=20
matter, a State or local law enforcement agency seeking information=20
under the section 314(a) program would have to certify that it is=20
investigating activity that would be criminalized under 18 U.S.C. 1956=20
or 1957. Such activity could include, for example, conducting a=20
financial transaction with proceeds of murder, kidnapping, or dealing=20
in a controlled substance (as defined in section 102 of the Controlled=20
Substances Act), which is punishable as a felony under State law.\4\
-------------------------------------------------------------------------=
--

    \4\ See 18 U.S.C. 1956(c)(7) (defining the term ``specified=20
unlawful activity'' to include, inter alia, an offense listed in 18=20
U.S.C. 1961(1)).
-------------------------------------------------------------------------=
--

B. Section 103.100(a)(4)

    FinCEN proposes to add 31 CFR 103.100(a)(4), which would define a=20
``law enforcement agency'' to include a Federal, State, local, or=20
foreign law enforcement agency with criminal investigative authority,=20
provided that the foreign law enforcement agency is from a jurisdiction=20
that is a party to a treaty that provides for, or in the determination=20
of FinCEN is from a jurisdiction that otherwise allows, law enforcement=20
agencies in the United States with reciprocal access to information=20
comparable to that obtainable under section 103.100. The addition of=20
foreign law enforcement agencies would enable the United States to be=20
compliant with its obligations under the U.S.-EU MLAT, thereby=20
providing law enforcement agencies in the United States with the=20
benefit of reciprocal access to information in EU member States. The=20
U.S.-EU MLAT, and 27 bilateral instruments with EU Member States=20
implementing its terms, require each EU member State to be able to=20
search for the kind of information covered by 31 CFR 103.100 and to=20
promptly report to the requesting State the results of such a search.
    The addition of State and local law enforcement agencies would=20
provide a platform for such agencies to deal more effectively with=20
multi-jurisdictional financial transactions in the same manner as=20
Federal law enforcement agencies. Access to the 314(a) program would=20
provide State and local law enforcement agencies with another resource=20
to aide in discovering the whereabouts of stolen proceeds.

C. Section 103.100(b)(1)

    FinCEN proposes to amend section 103.100(b)(1) to make conforming=20
changes to reflect the addition of State and local law enforcement=20
agencies, and foreign law enforcement agencies, as potential requesters=20
of information. These other categories of law enforcement agencies=20
would be subject to the same standard now applicable to Federal law=20
enforcement agencies--in particular, the requirement to certify that=20
each individual, entity, or organization about which the law=20
enforcement agency is seeking information is engaged in, or is=20
reasonably suspected based on credible evidence of engaging in,=20
terrorist activity or money laundering. To further ensure that=20
financial institutions are not overwhelmed by information requests,=20
FinCEN has, since 2003, adopted an additional operating procedure that=20
requires Federal law enforcement agencies to further certify that, in=20
the case of a money laundering investigation, the matter is=20
significant. FinCEN intends to apply that same standard to State, local=20
and certain foreign law enforcement agencies.

D. Section 103.100(b)(2)

    FinCEN proposes to add new 31 CFR 103.100(b)(2) which would clarify=20
that FinCEN may request directly, on its own behalf and on behalf of=20
appropriate components of the Department of the Treasury, whether a=20
financial institution or a group of financial institutions maintains or=20
has maintained accounts

[[Page 58929]]

for, or has engaged in transactions with, specified individuals,=20
entities, or organizations. Such information requests shall be for the=20
purpose of conducting analyses to deter and detect terrorist financing=20
activity or money laundering. Adding FinCEN, itself and acting on=20
behalf of other appropriate Treasury components, as a requester of=20
information will increase the value of analytical support to law=20
enforcement.

III. Administrative Matters

A. Executive Order 12866

    It has been determined that this proposed rule is a significant=20
regulatory action for purposes of Executive Order 12866 because it=20
raises a novel policy issue. However, a regulatory impact analysis is=20
not required.

B. Unfunded Mandates Act of 1995 Statement

    Section 202 of the Unfunded Mandates Reform Act of 1995 (``Unfunded=20
Mandates Act''), Public Law 104-4 (March 22, 1995), requires that an=20
agency prepare a budgetary impact statement before promulgating a rule=20
that may result in expenditure by that State, local, and tribal=20
governments, in the aggregate, or by the private sector, of $100=20
million or more in any one year. If a budgetary impact statement is=20
required, section 202 of the Unfunded Mandates Act also requires an=20
agency to identify and consider a reasonable number of regulatory=20
alternatives before promulgating a rule. FinCEN has determined that it=20
is not required to prepare a written statement under section 202.

C. Regulatory Flexibility Act

    Pursuant to the Regulatory Flexibility Act (RFA) (5 U.S.C. 601 et=20
seq.), FinCEN certifies that these proposed regulation revisions will=20
not have a significant economic impact on a substantial number of small=20
entities. The proposed revisions would allow certain other agencies to=20
submit 314(a) requests, but would not change the substance of the=20
search and reporting requirements. Thus, FinCEN estimates that any=20
impact resulting from the proposal will not be significant.

D. Paperwork Reduction Act

    The collection of information contained in this proposed rule is=20
being submitted to the Office of Management and Budget for review in=20
accordance with the Paperwork Reduction Act of 1995 (44 U.S.C.=20
3507(d)). Comments on the collection of information should be sent to:=20
Desk Officer for the Department of the Treasury, Office of Information=20
and Regulatory Affairs, Office of Management and Budget, Paperwork=20
Reduction Project (1506), Washington, DC 20503 at the following e-mail=20
address: <A =
href=3D"mailto:oira_submission@omb.eop.gov">oira_submission@omb.eop.gov</=
A>, with a copy to the Financial=20
Crimes Enforcement Network by mail or the Internet at the addresses=20
previously specified. As an alternative, comments may be submitted to=20
OMB by fax to (202) 395-6974. Comments on the collection of information=20
should be received by January 15, 2010. In accordance with the=20
requirements of the Paperwork Reduction Act of 1995, 44 U.S.C.=20
3506(c)(2)(A), and its implementing regulations, 5 CFR part 1320, the=20
following information concerning the collection of information is=20
presented to assist those persons wishing to comment on the information=20
collection.
    The collection of information in this proposal is in 31 CFR=20
103.100. The information will be used by Federal,\5\ State, and local=20
law enforcement agencies, as well as certain foreign law enforcement=20
agencies, and FinCEN and other appropriate components of the Department=20
of Treasury, in the conduct of investigating money laundering and=20
terrorist financing activity. The collection of information is=20
mandatory.
-------------------------------------------------------------------------=
--

    \5\ The requirement in section 103.100(b)(2), concerning reports=20
by financial institutions in response to a request from FinCEN on=20
behalf of a Federal law enforcement agency, is not a collection of=20
information for purposes of the Paperwork Reduction Act. See 5 CFR=20
1320.4(a)(2).
-------------------------------------------------------------------------=
--

    International Requests: FinCEN estimates that there would be no=20
more than 60 requests for research submitted to the 314(a) program by=20
foreign law enforcement agencies annually.\6\
-------------------------------------------------------------------------=
--

    \6\ These calculations were based on previous requests for=20
information. A review of incoming requests from European Union=20
countries revealed an average of about 350 cases per year from 2006-
2008. Of these, approximately 75% (an average of 269) were money=20
laundering and/or terrorism related, however, the majority were not=20
identified as complex cases. Conversations with FinCEN personnel=20
responsible for European Union indicated not more than 10% of the=20
money laundering and/or terrorism related cases would be significant=20
enough to meet 314(a) use criteria, however, it is anticipated that=20
there may be additional requests that would be submitted outside of=20
the normal Financial Intelligence Unit channels.
-------------------------------------------------------------------------=
--

    State and Local Requests: While there are more than 18,000 State=20
and local law enforcement agencies, FinCEN estimates that the number of=20
cases that would meet the stringent 314(a) submission criteria would be=20
relatively low. The majority of significant money laundering and=20
terrorist financing related cases are worked jointly with Federal=20
investigators and are thus already eligible for 314(a) request=20
submission. FinCEN estimates that there would be no more than 50 State=20
and local cases per annum of 314(a) requests that meet submission=20
criteria.
    FinCEN and appropriate components of the Department of the Treasury=20
Requests: FinCEN estimates that the 314(a) program would be used by=20
FinCEN and other appropriate Department components in fewer than 10=20
cases per annum. Taking into consideration the estimated number of=20
potential use cases that would fit recommended internal 314(a)=20
criteria, FinCEN does not believe that this expansion would be a=20
significant strain on existing program resources.
    Description of Recordkeepers: Covered financial institutions as=20
defined in 31 CFR 103.100.
    Estimated Number of Recordkeepers: On an annual basis, there are=20
approximately 20,134 covered financial institutions, consisting of=20
15,106 commercial banks, savings associations, and credit unions, 4,793=20
securities broker-dealers, 139 future commission merchants, 79 trust=20
companies, and 17 life insurance companies.
    Estimated Average Annual Burden Hours per Recordkeeper: FinCEN=20
estimates 120 search requests \7\ per year associated with the=20
recordkeeping requirement in this proposed rule and 9 subjects=20
(including aliases) per request, resulting in an estimated 1,080=20
subjects per year. The estimated average burden associated with=20
searching each subject is 4 minutes per subject. FinCEN therefore=20
estimates that each recordkeeper will, on average, spend approximately=20
4,320 minutes, or roughly 72 hours per year to comply with the=20
recordkeeping requirement in this proposed rule.
-------------------------------------------------------------------------=
--

    \7\ Estimated requests per annum subject to the Paperwork=20
Reduction Act include 10 from FinCEN, 50 from State/local=20
enforcement, and 60 from foreign law enforcement agencies, for a=20
total of 120 requests.
-------------------------------------------------------------------------=
--

    Estimated Total Annual Recordkeeping Burden: 1,449,648 annual=20
burden hours (20,134 recordkeepers x 72 average annual burden hours per=20
recordkeeper).
    An agency may not conduct or sponsor, and a person is not required=20
to respond to, a collection of information unless the collection of=20
information displays a valid OMB control number. Records required to be=20
retained under the Bank Secrecy Act must be retained for five years.
    Request for Comments: We specifically invite comments on: (a)=20
Whether the proposed recordkeeping requirement is necessary for the=20
proper performance of the mission of the Financial Crimes Enforcement=20
Network, and whether the information shall have practical utility; (b)=20
the accuracy of our

[[Page 58930]]

estimate of the burden of the proposed recordkeeping requirement; (c)=20
ways to enhance the quality, utility, and clarity of the information=20
required to be maintained; (d) ways to minimize the burden of the=20
recordkeeping requirement, including through the use of automated=20
collection techniques or other forms of information technology; and (e)=20
estimates of capital or start-up costs and costs of operation,=20
maintenance, and purchase of services to maintain the information.

amend 31 CFR part 103 as follows:

PART 103--FINANCIAL RECORDKEEPING AND REPORTING OF CURRENCY AND=20
FINANCIAL TRANSACTIONS

    1. The authority citation for part 103 continues to read as=20
follows:

    Authority: 12 U.S.C. 1829b and 1951-1959; 31 U.S.C. 5311-5314=20
and 5316-5332; title III, sec. 314, Public Law 107-56, 115 Stat.=20
307.

    2. Section 103.90(a) is revised to read as follows:


Sec.  103.90  Definitions.

* * * * *
    (a) Money laundering means an activity criminalized by 18 U.S.C.=20
1956 or 1957, or an activity that would be criminalized by 18 U.S.C.=20
1956 or 1957 if it occurred in the United States.
* * * * *
    3. Section 103.100 is amended by--
    a. Adding new paragraph (a)(4);
    b. Revising paragraph (b)(1);
    c. Redesignating paragraphs (b)(2) through (4) as paragraphs (b)(3)=20
through (5);
    d. Adding new paragraph (b)(2);
    e. Revising newly redesignated paragraph (b)(3)(i);
    f. Revising newly redesignated paragraph (b)(3)(iv)(B)(1);
    g. Revising newly redesignated paragraph (b)(3)(iv)(B)(2);
    h. Revising newly redesignated paragraph (b)(3)(iv)(C);
    i. Revising newly redesignated paragraph (b)(4); and
    j. Revising newly redesignated paragraph (b)(5).
    The revisions read as follows:


Sec.  103.100  Information sharing between government agencies and=20
financial institutions.

    (a) * * *
    (4) Law enforcement agency means a Federal, State, local, or=20
foreign law enforcement agency with criminal investigative authority,=20
provided that in the case of a foreign law enforcement agency, such=20
agency is from a jurisdiction that is a party to a treaty that provides=20
for, or in the determination of FinCEN is from a jurisdiction that=20
otherwise allows, law enforcement agencies in the United States=20
reciprocal access to information comparable to that obtainable under=20
this section.
    (b) Information requests based on credible evidence concerning=20
terrorist activity or money laundering--(1) In general. A law=20
enforcement agency investigating terrorist activity or money laundering=20
may request that FinCEN solicit, on the investigating agency's behalf,=20
certain information from a financial institution or a group of=20
financial institutions. When submitting such a request to FinCEN, the=20
law enforcement agency shall provide FinCEN with a written=20
certification, in such form and manner as FinCEN may prescribe. At a=20
minimum, such certification must: State that each individual, entity,=20
or organization about which the law enforcement agency is seeking=20
information is engaged in, or is reasonably suspected based on credible=20
evidence of engaging in, terrorist activity or money laundering;=20
include enough specific identifiers, such as date of birth, address,=20
and Social Security number, that would permit a financial institution=20
to differentiate between common or similar names; and identify one=20
person at the agency who can be contacted with any questions relating=20
to its request. Upon receiving the requisite certification from the=20
requesting law enforcement agency, FinCEN may require any financial=20
institution to search its records to determine whether the financial=20
institution maintains or has maintained accounts for, or has engaged in=20
transactions with, any specified individual, entity, or organization.
    (2) Requests from FinCEN. FinCEN may solicit, on its own behalf and=20
on behalf of appropriate components of the Department of the Treasury,=20
whether a financial institution or a group of financial institutions=20
maintains or has maintained accounts for, or has engaged in=20
transactions with, any specified individual, entity, or organization.=20
Before an information request under this section is made to a financial=20
institution, FinCEN or the appropriate Treasury component shall certify=20
in writing in the same manner as a requesting law enforcement agency=20
that each individual, entity or organization about which FinCEN or the=20
appropriate Treasury component is seeking information is engaged in, or=20
is reasonably suspected based on credible evidence of engaging in,=20
terrorist activity or money laundering. The certification also must=20
include enough specific identifiers, such as date of birth, address,=20
and Social Security number that would permit a financial institution to=20
differentiate between common or similar names, and identify one person=20
at FinCEN or the appropriate Treasury component who can be contacted=20
with any questions relating to its request.
    (3) Obligations of a financial institution receiving an information=20
request--(i) Record search. Upon receiving an information request from=20
FinCEN under this section, a financial institution shall expeditiously=20
search its records to determine whether it maintains or has maintained=20
any account for, or has engaged in any transaction with, each=20
individual, entity, or organization named in FinCEN's request. A=20
financial institution may contact the law enforcement agency, FinCEN or=20
requesting Treasury component representative, or U.S. law enforcement=20
attach[eacute] in the case of a request by a foreign law enforcement=20
agency, which has been named in the information request provided to the=20
institution by FinCEN with any questions relating to the scope or terms=20
of the request. Except as otherwise provided in the information=20
request, a financial institution shall only be required to search its=20
records for:
* * * * *
    (iv) * * *
    (B)(1) A financial institution shall not disclose to any person,=20
other than FinCEN or the requesting Treasury component, the law=20
enforcement agency on whose behalf FinCEN is requesting information, or=20
U.S. law enforcement attach[eacute] in the case of a request by a=20
foreign law enforcement agency, which has been named in the information=20
request, the fact that FinCEN has requested or has obtained information=20
under this section, except to the extent necessary to comply with such=20
an information request.
    (2) Notwithstanding paragraph (b)(3)(iv)(B)(1) of this section, a=20
financial institution authorized to share information under Sec. =20
103.110 may share information concerning an individual,

[[Page 58931]]

entity, or organization named in a request from FinCEN in accordance=20
with the requirements of such section. However, such sharing shall not=20
disclose the fact that FinCEN has requested information concerning such=20
individual, entity, or organization.
    (C) Each financial institution shall maintain adequate procedures=20
to protect the security and confidentiality of requests from FinCEN for=20
information under this section. The requirements of this paragraph=20
(b)(3)(iv)(C) shall be deemed satisfied to the extent that a financial=20
institution applies to such information procedures that the institution=20
has established to satisfy the requirements of section 501 of the=20
Gramm-Leach-Bliley Act (15 U.S.C. 6801), and applicable regulations=20
issued thereunder, with regard to the protection of its customers'=20
nonpublic personal information.
* * * * *
    (4) Relation to the Right to Financial Privacy Act and the Gramm-
Leach-Bliley Act. The information that a financial institution is=20
required to report pursuant to paragraph (b)(3)(ii) of this section is=20
information required to be reported in accordance with a federal=20
statute or rule promulgated thereunder, for purposes of subsection=20
3413(d) of the Right to Financial Privacy Act (12 U.S.C. 3413(d)) and=20
subsection 502(e)(8) of the Gramm-Leach-Bliley Act (15 U.S.C.=20
6802(e)(8)).
    (5) No effect on law enforcement or regulatory investigations.=20
Nothing in this subpart affects the authority of a Federal, State or=20
local law enforcement agency or officer, or FinCEN or another component=20
of the Department of the Treasury, to obtain information directly from=20
a financial institution.
