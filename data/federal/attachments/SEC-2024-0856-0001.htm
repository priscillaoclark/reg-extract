II. Self-Regulatory Organization's Statement of the Purpose of, and 
Statutory Basis for, the Proposed Rule Change

    In its filing with the Commission, the Exchange included statements 
concerning the purpose of and basis for the proposed rule change and 
discussed any comments it received on the proposed rule change. The 
text of these statements may be examined at the places specified in 
Item IV below. The Exchange has prepared summaries, set forth in 
sections A, B, and C below, of the most significant aspects of such 
statements.

A. Self-Regulatory Organization's Statement of the Purpose of, and 
Statutory Basis for, the Proposed Rule Change

1. Purpose
    The Exchange proposes to amend Options 7, Section 6, Ports and 
Other Services. Specifically, the Exchange proposes to amend the 
monthly caps for

[[Page 54114]]

SQF Ports \4\ and SQF Purge Ports.\5\ The Exchange proposes to sunset 
the amendments to Options 7, Section 6 on July 1, 2024. The amendments 
to Options 7, Section 6 proposed herein will remain in effect through 
the month of June 2024.
---------------------------------------------------------------------------

    \4\ ``Specialized Quote Feed'' or ``SQF'' is an interface that 
allows Market Makers to connect, send, and receive messages related 
to quotes, Immediate-or-Cancel Orders, and auction responses to the 
Exchange. Features include the following: (1) options symbol 
directory messages (e.g., underlying and complex instruments); (2) 
system event messages (e.g., start of trading hours messages and 
start of opening); (3) trading action messages (e.g., halts and 
resumes); (4) execution messages; (5) quote messages; (6) Immediate-
or-Cancel Order messages; (7) risk protection triggers and purge 
notifications; (8) opening imbalance messages; (9) auction 
notifications; and (10) auction responses. The SQF Purge Interface 
only receives and notifies of purge requests from the Market Maker. 
Market Makers may only enter interest into SQF in their assigned 
options series. Immediate-or-Cancel Orders entered into SQF are not 
subject to the (i) Order Price Protection, Market Order Spread 
Protection, and Size Limitation Protection in Options 3, Section 
15(a)(1)(A), (1)(B), and (2)(B) respectively, for single leg orders, 
or (ii) Complex Order Price Protection as defined in Options 3, 
Section 16(c)(1) for Complex Orders. See Supplementary Material 
.03(c) to Options 3, Section 7.
    \5\ SQF Purge is a specific port for the SQF interface that only 
receives and notifies of purge requests from the Market Maker. 
Dedicated SQF Purge Ports enable Market Makers to seamlessly manage 
their ability to remove their quotes in a swift manner. The SQF 
Purge Port is designed to assist Market Makers in the management of, 
and risk control over, their quotes. Market Makers may utilize a 
purge port to reduce uncertainty and to manage risk by purging all 
quotes in their assigned options series. Of note, Market Makers may 
only enter interest into SQF in their assigned options series. 
Additionally, the SQF Purge Port may be utilized by a Market Maker 
in the event that the Member has a system issue and determines to 
purge its quotes from the order book.
---------------------------------------------------------------------------

    Today, MRX assesses $1,250 per port, per month for an SQF Port as 
well as an SQF Purge Port. Today, MRX waives one SQF Port fee per 
Market Maker per month. Also, today, SQF Ports and SQF Purge Ports are 
subject to a monthly cap of $17,500, which cap is applicable to Market 
Makers.
    At this time, the Exchange proposes to establish an increased SQF 
Fee and SQF Purge Port Cap to Primary Market Makers and Market Makers 
that do not provide a minimum amount of liquidity on MRX. This proposed 
increased SQF Fee and SQF Purge Port Cap is intended to incentivize 
Primary Market Makers and Market Makers to add liquidity on MRX for the 
benefit of other market participants in order to lower their fees. MRX 
proposes to increase the SQF Port and SQF Purge Port Cap to $27,500 a 
month if a Primary Market Maker or Market Maker does not transact 0.50% 
of Total Customer Volume in electronic simple orders that adds 
liquidity in a month.\6\ Today, MRX caps an SQF Port and SQF Purge Port 
at $17,500 a month. With this proposal, the Exchange would not assess 
Primary Market Makers and Market Makers an SQF Port and SQF Purge Port 
Cap beyond the monthly cap of $27,500, instead of $17,500, once the 
Member has exceeded the proposed port cap for the respective month. 
Primary Market Makers and Market Makers who transacts 0.50% of Total 
Customer Volume in electronic simple orders that adds liquidity in a 
month will continue to be subject to the $17,500 SQF Port and SQF Purge 
Port Cap.
---------------------------------------------------------------------------

    \6\ For purposes of this cap, ``Total Customer Volume'' shall be 
defined as a percentage of all cleared customer volume at The 
Options Clearing Corporation in Multiply Listed Equity Options and 
Exchange-Traded Products (``TCV'').
---------------------------------------------------------------------------

    Pursuant to Supplementary Material .03(c) to Options 3, Section 7, 
Market Makers may only enter interest into SQF in their assigned 
options series. Pursuant to Supplementary Material .03(c) to Options 3, 
Section 7, the SQF interface allows Market Makers to connect, send, and 
receive messages related to quotes, Immediate-or-Cancel Orders, and 
auction responses to the Exchange. An SQF Purge is a specific port for 
the SQF interface that only receives and notifies of purge requests 
from the Market Maker. A MRX Market Maker requires only one SQF Port to 
submit quotes in its assigned options series into MRX. While a Market 
Maker may elect to obtain multiple SQF Ports and SQF Purge Ports to 
organize its business,\7\ only one SQF Port and SQF Purge Port is 
necessary for a Market Maker to fulfill its regulatory quoting 
obligations.\8\
---------------------------------------------------------------------------

    \7\ For example, a Market Maker may desire to utilize multiple 
SQF Ports for accounting purposes, to measure performance, for 
regulatory reasons or other determinations that are specific to that 
Member.
    \8\ MRX Market Makers have various regulatory requirements as 
provided for in Options 2, Section 4. Additionally, MRX Market 
Makers have certain quoting requirements with respect to their 
assigned options series as provided in Options 2, Section 5. SQF 
Ports are the only quoting protocol available on MRX and only Market 
Makers may utilize SQF Ports. The same is true for SQF Purge Ports.
---------------------------------------------------------------------------

2. Statutory Basis
    The Exchange believes that its proposal is consistent with Section 
6(b) of the Act,\9\ in general, and furthers the objectives of Sections 
6(b)(4) and 6(b)(5) of the Act,\10\ in particular, in that it provides 
for the equitable allocation of reasonable dues, fees, and other 
charges among members and issuers and other persons using any facility, 
and is not designed to permit unfair discrimination between customers, 
issuers, brokers, or dealers.
---------------------------------------------------------------------------

    \9\ 15 U.S.C. 78f(b).
    \10\ 15 U.S.C. 78f(b)(4) and (5).
---------------------------------------------------------------------------

    The Exchange believes that its proposal is consistent with Section 
6(b) of the Act,\11\ in general, and furthers the objectives of 
Sections 6(b)(4) and 6(b)(5) of the Act,\12\ in particular, in that it 
provides for the equitable allocation of reasonable dues, fees, and 
other charges among members and issuers and other persons using any 
facility, and is not designed to permit unfair discrimination between 
customers, issuers, brokers, or dealers.
---------------------------------------------------------------------------

    \11\ 15 U.S.C. 78f(b).
    \12\ 15 U.S.C. 78f(b)(4) and (5).
---------------------------------------------------------------------------

    The proposed pricing change to increase the SQF Port and SQF Purge 
Port monthly cap from $17,500 per month to $27,500 per month if Primary 
Market Makers or Market Makers do not transact 0.50% of Total Customer 
Volume in electronic simple orders that adds liquidity in a month is 
reasonable because it will incentivize Primary Market Makers and Market 
Makers to add liquidity on MRX to lower their costs. The Exchange 
believes that the total volume required to achieve the cap is 
reasonable as the Exchange has limited the volume to simple orders, as 
not all Market Makers transact complex orders. Further, 0.50% of Total 
Customer Volume in electronic simple orders that adds liquidity in a 
month is an achievable number for Market Makers who currently add 
volume to the Exchange. Additionally, the Exchange believes that an SQF 
Fee and SQF Purge Port Cap of $27,500, in lieu of $17, 500, is 
reasonable because Primary Market Makers and Market Makers are 
obligated, among other things, to compete with other Market Makers to 
improve the market in all series of options classes to which the Market 
Maker is appointed and to update market quotations in response to 
changed market conditions in all series of options classes to which the 
Market Maker is appointed.\13\ The Exchange believes that it is 
reasonable to increase the SQF Port and SQF Purge Port Cap to $27,500 
for Primary Market Makers and Market Makers that do not transact 0.50% 
of Total Customer Volume in electronic simple orders that adds 
liquidity in a month because the Exchange believes that Primary Market 
Makers and Market Makers that do not contribute a minimum amount of 
liquidity on MRX should not be subject to the same opportunities to 
lower their costs as those Primary Market Makers and Market Makers that 
do contribute to liquidity and therefore provide the ability for other 
market participants to

[[Page 54115]]

engage with that order flow. The Exchange believes that the increase is 
modest and would serve to encourage Primary Market Makers and Market 
Makers to submit order flow to MRX in order to lower their cost and 
would result in additional order competition, which also benefits 
market participants. The Exchange believes this proposal promotes 
liquidity, quote competition, and trading opportunities.
---------------------------------------------------------------------------

    \13\ See Options 2, Section 4(b)(1) and (3).
---------------------------------------------------------------------------

    SQF Ports and SQF Purge Ports are utilized by Primary Market Makers 
and Market Makers to quote on MRX. A Market Maker may submit all quotes 
through one SQF Port and utilize one SQF Purge Port to view its purge 
requests. While a Market Maker may elect to obtain multiple SQF Ports 
to organize its business,\14\ only one SQF Port is necessary for a 
Market Maker to fulfill its regulatory quoting obligations.\15\ For 
those Market Makers that elect to organize themselves by obtaining a 
greater number of SQF Ports or SQF Purge Ports, they will be subject to 
a cap.\16\ For Market Makers that only take 1 SQF Port or only a few 
SQF Ports or SQF Purge Ports, their costs would be far below the 
$27,500 or $17,500 threshold for the cap.
---------------------------------------------------------------------------

    \14\ For example, a Market Maker may desire to utilize multiple 
SQF Ports and SQF Purge Ports for accounting purposes, to measure 
performance, for regulatory reasons or other determinations that are 
specific to that member organization.
    \15\ Market Makers have various regulatory requirements as 
provided for in Options 2, Section 4. Additionally, Market Makers 
have certain quoting requirements with respect to their assigned 
options series as provided in Options 2, Section 5. SQF Ports are 
the only quoting protocol available on MRX.
    \16\ The number of ports that members choose to purchase varies 
widely. Today, on MRX, 2 Market Makers have 1 SQF Ports/SQF Purge 
Ports, no Market Makers have 2-5 SQF Ports/SQF Purge Ports, 2 Market 
Makers have between 6-10 SQF Ports/SQF Purge Ports, and 6 Market 
Makers have more than 10 SQF Ports/SQF Purge Ports.
---------------------------------------------------------------------------

    The proposed pricing change to increase the SQF Fee and SQF Purge 
Cap for Primary Market Makers and Market Makers to $27,500 a month if 
Primary Market Makers or Market Makers do not transact 0.50% of Total 
Customer Volume in electronic simple orders that adds liquidity in a 
month is equitable and not unfairly discriminatory as all Primary 
Market Makers and Market Makers would be able to cap their SQF Port and 
SQF Purge Port costs at $17,500, provided they transacted the requisite 
volume, otherwise Primary Market Makers and Market Makers would be 
uniformly subject to the $27,500 SQF Port and SQF Purge Port Cap. The 
Exchange notes that unlike other market participants, Primary Market 
Makers are obligated to quote in the Opening Process and intra-day.\17\ 
Additionally, Market Makers may enter quotes in the Opening Process to 
open an option series and they are required to quote intra-day.\18\ 
Further, unlike other market participants, Primary Market Makers and 
Market Makers have obligations to compete with other Market Makers to 
improve the market in all series of options classes to which the Market 
Maker is appointed and to update market quotations in response to 
changed market conditions in all series of options classes to which the 
Market Maker is appointed.\19\ Finally, unlike other market 
participants, Primary Market Makers and Market Makers incur other costs 
related to their quoting obligations in addition to other fees paid by 
other market participants. Market Makers are subject to a number of 
fees, unlike other market participants. Market Makers pay separate 
Membership Fees,\20\ and CMM Trading Right Fees,\21\ in addition to 
other fees paid by other market participants. These liquidity providers 
are critical market participants in that they are the only market 
participants that provide liquidity to MRX and are necessary for 
opening the market. Allowing Primary Market Makers and Market Makers to 
manage their costs by capping SQF Ports and SQF Purge Ports in addition 
to transaction fees enables these essential market participants to 
manage their business model more effectively and better allocate 
resources to other technologies that are necessary to manage risk and 
capacity to ensure that these market participants continue to compete 
effectively on MRX. The following chart represents the classification 
of MRX members and the percentage of Market Makers.

    MRX believes Primary Market Makers and Market Makers should be 
eligible for certain incentives because they fulfill a unique role on 
the Exchange and are the only market participants required to submit 
quotes to the Exchange. The proposed SQF Port and SQF Purge Cap is 
designed to ensure that Primary Market Makers and Market Makers add a 
certain amount of liquidity on MRX in order to be able to cap their SQF 
Port and SQF Purge Port Fees at the lower cap of $17,500 as compared to 
the increased cap of $27,500. The Exchange would apply the criteria 
uniformly when applying the SQF Fee and SQF Purge Cap to Primary Market 
Makers and Market Makers.
    Finally, MRX believes the proposed SQF Fee and SQF Purge Cap is 
constrained by competitive forces and reasonably designed in 
consideration of the competitive environment in which the Exchange 
operates. This fee structure incents Primary Market Makers and Market 
Makers to support increased liquidity, quote competition, and trading 
opportunities on the Exchange, for the benefit of all market 
participants.

B. Self-Regulatory Organization's Statement on Burden on Competition

    The Exchange does not believe that the proposed rule change will 
impose any burden on competition not necessary or appropriate in 
furtherance of the purposes of the Act.
Intermarket Competition
    The proposal does not impose an undue burden on intermarket 
competition. The Exchange believes its proposal remains competitive 
with other options markets who also offer order entry protocols. The 
Exchange notes that it operates in a highly competitive market in which 
market participants can readily favor competing venues if they deem fee 
levels at a particular venue to be excessive. The chart below shows the 
February 2024 market share for multiply listed options by exchange. Of 
the 17 operating options exchanges, none currently has more than a 
17.6% market share. Customers widely distribute their transactions 
across exchanges according to their business needs and the ability of 
each exchange to meet those needs through technology, liquidity and 
functionality.
[GRAPHIC] [TIFF OMITTED] TN28JN24.023

    Market share is the percentage of volume on a particular exchange 
relative to the total volume across all exchanges, and indicates the 
amount of order flow directed to that exchange. High levels of market 
share enhance the value of trading and ports.
    In such an environment, the Exchange must continually adjust its 
fees to remain competitive with other exchanges. Because competitors 
are free to modify their own fees in response, and because market 
participants may readily adjust their order routing practices, the 
Exchange believes that the degree to which fee changes in this market 
may impose any burden on competition is extremely limited.
Intramarket Competition
    The proposed pricing change to increase the SQF Fee and SQF Purge 
Cap for Primary Market Makers and Market Makers to $27,500 a month if 
Primary Market Makers or Market Makers do not transact 0.50% of Total 
Customer Volume in electronic simple orders that adds liquidity in a 
month does not impose an undue burden on competition as all Primary 
Market Makers and Market Makers would be able to cap their SQF Port and 
SQF Purge Port costs at $17,500, provided they transacted the requisite 
volume, otherwise Primary Market Makers and Market Makers would be 
uniformly subject to the $27,500 SQF Port and SQF Purge Port Cap. The 
Exchange notes that unlike other market participants, Primary Market 
Makers are obligated to quote in the Opening Process and intra-day.\22\ 
Additionally, Market Makers may enter quotes in the Opening Process to 
open an option series and they are required to quote intra-day.\23\ 
Further, unlike other market participants, Primary Market Makers and 
Market Makers have obligations to compete with other Market Makers to 
improve the market in all series of options classes to which the Market 
Maker is appointed and to update market quotations in response to

[[Page 54117]]

changed market conditions in all series of options classes to which the 
Market Maker is appointed.\24\ Finally, unlike other market 
participants, Primary Market Makers and Market Makers incur other costs 
related to their quoting obligations in addition to other fees paid by 
other market participants. Market Makers are subject to a number of 
fees, unlike other market participants. Market Makers pay separate 
Membership Fees,\25\ and CMM Trading Right Fees,\26\ in addition to 
other fees paid by other market participants. These liquidity providers 
are critical market participants in that they are the only market 
participants that provide liquidity to MRX and are necessary for 
opening the market. Allowing Primary Market Makers and Market Makers to 
manage their costs by capping SQF Ports and SQF Purge Ports in addition

Port and SQF Purge Port Fees at the lower cap of $17,500 as compared to 
the increased cap of $27,500. The Exchange would apply the criteria 
uniformly when applying the SQF Fee and SQF Purge Cap to Primary Market 
Makers and Market Makers.
