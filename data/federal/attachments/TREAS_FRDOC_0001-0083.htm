DEPARTMENT OF THE TREASURY

Office of the Secretary

31 CFR Part 1

 
Freedom of Information Act, Privacy Act of 1974; Implementation

AGENCY: Department of the Treasury.

ACTION: Final rule.

-----------------------------------------------------------------------

SUMMARY: This document amends the Department of the Treasury's 
regulations on the disclosure of records under the Freedom of 
Information Act (FOIA) and its regulations concerning the Privacy Act 
of 1974 (Privacy Act). It also amends the appendices to these subparts 
setting forth the administrative procedures by which the Special 
Inspector General for the Troubled Asset Relief Program (``SIGTARP'') 
will process requests for records made under the FOIA, and setting 
forth the administrative procedures by which SIGTARP will implement the 
Privacy Act. In addition, the document revises the list of Treasury 
offices and bureaus found in this part.

DATES: Effective Date: January 6, 2010.

FOR FURTHER INFORMATION CONTACT: Dale Underwood, Privacy Act Officer, 
Department of the Treasury, phone number 202-622-0874 or 
<A HREF="mailto:dale.underwood@do.treas.gov">dale.underwood@do.treas.gov</A>.

SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION: These regulations update the list of 
Treasury bureaus and offices enumerated in 31 CFR 1.1 and 1.20, and 
more closely reflect the organization of the Department as set out in 
Treasury Order 101-05, ``Reporting Relationships and Supervision of 
Officials, Offices and Bureaus, Delegation of Certain Authority, and 
Order of Succession in the Department of the Treasury'' dated February 
19, 2008.
    Language is being added to the first paragraph of Section 1.1 to 
permit offices and bureaus to issue supplementary regulations 
applicable only to the component in question, which are consistent with 
the regulations. This will conform 31 CFR Section 1.1 with the language 
found in 31 CFR Section 1.20. Another change is to consistently use the 
term ``component'' in Section 1.1 and 1.20 rather than using the term 
``offices and bureaus'' in one and ``components'' in the other.
    The document also amends 31 CFR part 1 and the FOIA and Privacy Act 
procedures of Treasury's Departmental Offices found in the appendices 
to subparts A and C of this Part. It reflects the creation of the 
Special Inspector General for the Troubled Asset Relief Program 
(SIGTARP) authorized under Section 121 of The Emergency Economic 
Stabilization Act of 2008 (``Act''), Public Law 110-343. As an 
independent office of the Department of Treasury, SIGTARP is 
responsible for coordinating and conducting audits and investigations 
of the Troubled Asset Relief Program established by the Secretary under 
the Act.
    The passage of the Homeland Security Act of 2002 established the 
Alcohol and Tobacco Tax and Trade Bureau (TTB) as a bureau of the 
Department of the Treasury and transferred certain functions of the 
Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco, and Firearms to the Department of Justice. 
Three other bureaus, the United States Customs Service, Federal Law 
Enforcement Training Center, and the United States Secret Service, were 
transferred to the Department of Homeland Security. This final rule 
makes the necessary housekeeping changes to reflect the transfer of 
these bureaus and functions to other Federal Departments and the 
establishment of SIGTARP by revising the list of Treasury bureaus and 
offices and re-designating the respective paragraphs of Sections 1.1 
and 1.20.
    As part of the review undertaken to identify minor changes to the 
regulations in Subpart C it was found that a system of records that had 
been deleted from the Department's inventory of systems of records on 
April 17, 1992, at 57 FR 13900 had not been removed from the list of 
Privacy Act systems of records for which an exemption has been claimed 
pursuant to 5 USC 552a (k)(2). The final regulation makes this 
correction to Section 1.36 of subpart C, Paragraph (g)(1)(v)(iii) by 
removing the system of records entitled ``IRS 42.012-Combined Case 
Control File'' from the table.
    Appendix A to subpart A of Part 1 (FOIA) is being amended to update 
the titles of those officials who have been identified for receipt of 
FOIA requests, administrative appeals, and appellate determinations for 
requests for expedited processing.
    Appendix A to subpart C of Part 1 (Privacy Act) is being amended to 
update the offices or titles of those who receive Privacy Act requests, 
requests for amendment of records or administrative appeal of an 
initial determination not to amend a record. In addition, the 
instructions found in this appendix for delivering requests personally 
to the Main Treasury Building are being deleted because of the 
increased security requirements caused by Treasury's proximity to the 
White House.
    These regulations are being published as a final rule because the 
amendments do not impose any requirements on any member of the public 
and do not alter the procedures relating to the way in which the 
Departmental Offices currently handle FOIA and PA obligations. These 
amendments are the most efficient means for the Treasury Department to 
implement its internal requirements for complying with the FOIA and the 
Privacy Act. Accordingly, pursuant to 5 U.S.C. 553(b)(B) and (d)(3), 
the Department of the Treasury finds good cause that prior notice and 
other public procedure with respect to this rule are impracticable and 
unnecessary and finds good cause for making this rule effective on the 
date of publication in the Federal Register.
    In accordance with Executive Order 12866, it has been determined 
that this final rule is not a ``significant regulatory action'' and, 
therefore, does not require a Regulatory Impact Analysis.
    The regulation will not have a substantial direct effect on the 
States, on the relationship between the national Government and the 
States, or on the distribution of power and responsibilities among the 
various levels of government. Therefore, it is determined that this 
final rule does not have federalism implications under Executive Order 
13132.
    Because no notice of proposed rulemaking is required, the 
provisions of the Regulatory Flexibility Act (5 U.S.C. 601 et seq.) do 
not apply.

Sec.  1.20  Purpose and scope of regulation.

    The regulations in this subpart are issued to implement the 
provisions of the Privacy Act of 1974 (5 U.S.C. 552a). The regulations 
apply to all records which are contained in systems of records 
maintained by the Department of the Treasury and which are retrieved by 
an individual's name or personal identifier. They do not relate to 
those personnel records of Government employees, which are under the 
jurisdiction of the Office of Personnel Management to the extent such 
records are subject to regulations issued by such OPM. The regulations 
apply to all components of the Department of the Treasury. Any 
reference in this subpart to the Department or its officials, 
employees, or records shall be deemed to refer also to the components 
or their officials, employees, or records. The regulations set forth 
the requirements applicable to Department of the Treasury employees 
maintaining, collecting, using or disseminating

[[Page 745]]

records pertaining to individuals. They also set forth the procedures 
by which individuals may request notification of whether the Department 
of the Treasury maintains or has disclosed a record pertaining to them 
or may seek access to such records maintained in any nonexempt system 
of records, request correction of such records, appeal any initial 
adverse determination of any request for amendment, or may seek an 
accounting of disclosures of such records. For the convenience of 
interested persons, the components of the Department of the Treasury 
may reprint these regulations in their entirety (less any appendices 
not applicable to the component in question) in those titles of the 
Code of Federal Regulations which normally contain regulations 
applicable to such components. In connection with such republication, 
and at other appropriate times, components may issue supplementary 
regulations applicable only to the component in question, which are 
consistent with these regulations. In the event of any actual or 
apparent inconsistency, these Departmental regulations shall govern. 
Persons interested in the records of a particular component should, 
therefore, also consult the Code of Federal Regulations for any rules 
or regulations promulgated specifically with respect to that component 
(see Appendices to this subpart for cross references). The head of each 
component is hereby also authorized to substitute other appropriate 
officials for those designated and correct addresses specified in the 
appendix to this subpart applicable to the component. The components of 
the Department of the Treasury for the purposes of this subpart are the
