SECURITIES AND EXCHANGE COMMISSION

[SEC File No. 270-360, OMB Control No. 3235-0409]


Submission for OMB Review; Comment Request; Extension Rule 17Ad-
15

Upon Written Request, Copies Available From: Securities and Exchange 
Commission, Office of FOIA Services, 100 F Street NE, Washington, DC 
20549-2736.

    Notice is hereby given that pursuant to the Paperwork Reduction Act 
of 1995 (``PRA'') (44 U.S.C. 3501 et seq.), the Securities and Exchange 
Commission (``Commission'') has submitted to the Office of Management 
and Budget (``OMB'') a request for approval of extension of the 
previously approved collection of information provided for in Rule 
17Ad-15 (17 CFR 240.17Ad-15) (``Rule 17Ad-15'') under the Securities 
Exchange Act of 1934 (15 U.S.C. 78a et seq.) (``Exchange Act'').
    Rule 17Ad-15 requires every registered transfer agent to establish 
written standards for the acceptance of guarantees of securities 
transfers from eligible guarantor institutions. Every registered 
transfer agent is also required to establish procedures, including 
written guidelines where appropriate, to make certain that the transfer 
agent uses those standards to determine whether to accept or reject 
guarantees from eligible guarantor institutions. In implementing these 
requirements, the Commission aims to ensure that registered transfer 
agents treat eligible guarantor institutions equitably.
    Additionally, Rule 17Ad-15 requires every registered transfer agent 
to make and maintain records in the event the transfer agent determines 
to reject signature guarantees from eligible guarantor institutions. 
Registered transfer agents' records must include, following the date of 
rejection, a record of the rejected transfer, along with the reason for 
rejection, the identification of the guarantor, and an indication 
whether the guarantor failed to meet the transfer agent's guarantee 
standards. Rule 17Ad-15 requires registered transfer agents to maintain 
these records for a period of three years. The Commission designed 
these mandatory recordkeeping requirements to assist the Commission and 
other regulatory agencies with monitoring registered transfer agents 
and ensuring compliance with the rule. This rule does not involve the 
collection of confidential information.
    The Commission estimates that approximately 315 registered transfer 
agents will spend a total of approximately 12,600 burden hours per year 
complying with recordkeeping requirements of Rules 17Ad-15 (based on 
approximately 40 burden hours per year per registered transfer agent). 
The Commission also estimates the aggregate annual internal cost of 
compliance for the approximately 315 registered transfer agents is 
approximately $4,019,400 (based on 40 hours annual burden x $319 hourly 
wage x 315 respondents). This reflects a decline in aggregate annual 
internal cost of compliance of $650,760 due to the decrease in the 
number of registered transfer agents from 366 to 315.
    An agency may not conduct or sponsor, and a person is not required 
to respond to, a collection of information under the PRA unless it 
displays a currently valid OMB control number.

Vanessa A. Countryman,
Secretary.
