FEDERAL RESERVE SYSTEM


Proposed Agency Information Collection Activities; Comment 
Request

AGENCY: Board of Governors of the Federal Reserve System

SUMMARY: Background. On June 15, 1984, the Office of Management and 
Budget (OMB) delegated to the Board of Governors of the Federal Reserve 
System (Board) its approval authority under the Paperwork Reduction Act 
(PRA), as per 5 CFR 1320.16, to approve of and assign OMB control 
numbers to collection of information requests and requirements 
conducted or sponsored by the Board under conditions set forth in 5 CFR 
Part 1320 Appendix A.1. Board-approved collections of information are 
incorporated into the official OMB inventory of currently approved 
collections of information. Copies of the Paperwork Reduction Act 
Submission, supporting statements and approved collection of 
information instruments are placed into OMB's public docket files. The 
Federal Reserve may not conduct or sponsor, and the respondent is not 
required to respond to, an information collection that has been 
extended, revised, or implemented on or after October 1, 1995, unless 
it displays a currently valid OMB control number.

Request for Comment on Information Collection Proposals

    The following information collections, which are being handled 
under this delegated authority, have received initial Board approval 
and are hereby published for comment. At the end of the comment period, 
the proposed information collections, along with an analysis of 
comments and recommendations received, will be submitted to the Board 
for final approval under OMB delegated authority. Comments are invited 
on the following:
    a. Whether the proposed collection of information is necessary for 
the proper performance of the Federal Reserve's functions; including 
whether the information has practical utility;
    b. The accuracy of the Federal Reserve's estimate of the burden of 
the proposed information collection, including the validity of the 
methodology and assumptions used;
    c. Ways to enhance the quality, utility, and clarity of the 
information to be collected; and
    d. Ways to minimize the burden of information collection on 
respondents, including through the use of automated collection 
techniques or other forms of information technology.

    General description of report: This information collection is 
mandatory (12 U.S.C. 1844(c)). Confidential treatment is not routinely 
given to the data in these reports. However, confidential treatment for 
the reporting information, in whole or in part, can be requested in 
accordance with the instructions to the form, pursuant to sections 
(b)(4) and (b)(6) of the Freedom of Information Act (5 U.S.C. 
522(b)(4), (b)(6)).
    Abstract: The FR Y-9C and the FR Y-9LP are standardized financial 
statements for the consolidated bank holding company (BHC) and its 
parent. The FR Y-9 family of reports historically has been, and 
continues to be, the primary source of financial information on BHCs 
between on-site inspections. Financial information from these reports 
is used to detect emerging financial problems, to review performance 
and conduct pre-inspection analysis, to monitor and evaluate capital 
adequacy, to evaluate BHC mergers and acquisitions, and to analyze a 
BHC's overall financial condition to ensure safe and sound operations.
    The FR Y-9C consists of standardized financial statements similar 
to the Federal Financial Institutions Examination Council (FFIEC) 
Consolidated Reports of Condition and Income (Call Reports) (FFIEC 031 
& 041; OMB No. 7100-0036) filed by commercial banks. The FR Y-9C 
collects consolidated data from BHCs. The FR Y-9C is filed by top-tier 
BHCs with total consolidated assets of $500 million or more. (Under 
certain circumstances defined in the General Instructions, BHCs under 
$500 million may be required to file the FR Y-9C.)
    The FR Y-9LP includes standardized financial statements filed 
quarterly on a parent company only basis from each BHC that files the 
FR Y-9C. In addition, for tiered BHCs, a separate FR Y-9LP must be 
filed for each lower tier BHC.
    Current actions: The Federal Reserve proposes the following 
revisions and clarifications to the FR Y-9C: (1) Break out by loan 
category of other loans and leases that are troubled debt 
restructurings for those that (a) are past due 30 days or more or in 
nonaccrual status or (b) are in compliance with their modified terms 
and clarify reporting of restructured troubled debt consumer loans, (2) 
break out other consumer loans into automobile loans and all other 
consumer loans in several schedules, (3) break out commercial mortgage-
backed securities issued or guaranteed by U.S. Government agencies and 
sponsored agencies, (4) create a new Schedule HC-V, Variable Interest 
Entities, for reporting major categories of assets and liabilities of 
consolidated variable interest entities (VIEs), (5) break out loans and 
other real estate owned (OREO) information covered by FDIC loss-sharing 
agreements by loan and OREO category, (6) break out life insurance 
assets into data items for general account and separate account life 
insurance assets, (7) add new data items for the total assets of 
captive insurance and reinsurance subsidiaries, (8) add new income 
statement items for credit valuation adjustments and debit valuation 
adjustments included in trading revenues (for BHCs with total assets of 
$100 billion or more), (9) revise reporting instructions in the areas 
of construction lending, 1-4 family residential mortgage banking 
activities, and maturity and repricing data, and (10) collect expanded 
information on the quarterly-averages schedule. The proposed changes 
would be effective as of March 31, 2011.
    The Federal Reserve proposes to revise the FR Y-9LP to modify a 
data item collecting loans and leases of the parent restructured in 
compliance with modified terms. This data item would be redefined to 
exclude leases and to explicitly refer to restructured loans in this 
data item as troubled debt restructurings. The proposed changes would 
be effective as of March 31, 2011.
    For the March 31, 2011, reporting date, BHCs may provide reasonable 
estimates for any new or revised FR Y-9C or FR Y-9LP data item 
initially required to be reported as of that date for which the 
requested information is not readily available. The specific wording of 
the captions for the new or revised FR Y-9C or FR Y-9LP data items 
discussed in this proposal and the numbering of these data items should 
be regarded as preliminary.

Proposed Revisions--FR Y-9C

A. Proposed Revisions Related to Call Report Revisions

    The Federal Reserve proposes to make the following revisions to the 
FR Y-9C to parallel proposed changes to the Call Report. BHCs have 
commented that changes should be made to the FR Y-9C in a manner 
consistent with changes to the Call Report to reduce reporting burden.
A.1 Troubled Debt Restructurings
    The Federal Reserve proposes that BHCs report additional detail on 
loans that have undergone troubled debt restructurings in Schedule HC-
C, Loans and Lease Financing Receivables, and Schedule HC-N, Past Due 
and Nonaccrual Loans, Leases, and Other Assets. More specifically, 
Schedule HC-C, Memorandum item 1.b, Other loans and all leases, 
restructured and in compliance with modified terms, and Schedule HC-N, 
Memorandum item 1.b, restructured, Other loans and all leases, included 
in Schedule HC-N, would be broken out to provide information on 
restructured troubled loans for many of the loan categories reported in 
the bodies of Schedule HC-C and Schedule HC-N. The breakout would also 
include Loans to individuals for household, family, and other personal 
expenditures, whose terms have been modified in troubled debt 
restructurings, which are currently excluded from the reporting of 
troubled debt restructurings.
    In the aggregate, troubled debt restructurings for all FR Y-9C 
respondents have grown from $11.4 billion at year-end 2007 to $106.2 
billion as of March 31, 2010. The proposed additional detail on 
troubled debt restructurings in Schedules HC-C and HC-N would enable 
the Federal Reserve to better understand the level of restructuring 
activity at BHCs, the categories of loans involved in this activity, 
and whether BHCs are working with their borrowers to modify and 
restructure loans. In particular, to encourage banking organizations to 
work constructively with their commercial borrowers, the banking 
agencies recently issued guidance on commercial real estate loan 
workouts and small business lending.\1\ While this guidance has 
explained the agencies' expectations for prudent workouts, the Federal 
Reserve and the industry would benefit from additional reliable data 
outside of the examination process to assess restructuring activity at 
BHCs for commercial real estate loans and commercial and industrial 
loans. Further, it is important to separately identify commercial real 
estate loan restructurings from commercial and industrial loan 
restructurings given that the value of the real estate collateral is a 
consideration in a BHC's decision to modify the terms of a commercial 
real estate loan in a troubled debt restructuring, but such collateral 
protection would normally be absent from commercial and industrial 
loans for which a loan modification is being explored because of 
borrowers' financial difficulties.

    \1\ Interagency Statement on Meeting the Credit Needs of 
Creditworthy Small Business Borrowers, issued February 12, 2010, and 
Policy Statement on Prudent Commercial Real Estate Loan Workouts, 
issued October 30, 2009.
---------------------------------------------------------------------------

    It is also anticipated that other loan categories will experience 
continued workout activity in the coming months given that most asset 
classes have been

[[Page 67723]]

adversely affected by the recent recession. This affect is evidenced by 
the increase in past due and nonaccrual assets across virtually all 
asset classes over the past two to three years.
    Currently, BHCs report loans and leases restructured and in 
compliance with their modified terms (Schedule HC-C, Memorandum item 
(1) with separate disclosure of (a) loans secured by 1-4 family 
residential properties (in domestic offices) and (b) other loans and 
all leases (excluding loans to individuals for household, family, and 
other personal expenditures). This same breakout is reflected in 
Schedule HC-N, Memorandum item 1, for past due and nonaccrual 
restructured troubled loans. The broad category of other loans in 
Schedule HC-C, Memorandum item 1.b, and Schedule HC-N, Memorandum item 
1.b, does not permit an adequate analysis of troubled debt 
restructurings. In addition, the disclosure requirements for troubled 
debt restructurings under generally accepted accounting principles 
(GAAP) do not exempt restructurings of loans to individuals for 
household, family, and other personal expenditures. Therefore, if more 
detail were to be added to match the reporting of loans in Schedule HC-
C and Schedule HC-N, the new data would provide the Federal Reserve 
with the level of information necessary to assess BHCs' troubled debt 
restructurings to the same extent that other loan quality and 
performance indicators can be assessed. However, the Federal Reserve 
notes that, under GAAP, troubled debt restructurings do not include 
changes in lease agreements \2\ and therefore propose to exclude leases 
from Schedule HC-C, Memorandum item 1, and from Schedule HC-N, 
Memorandum item 1, and strike the phrase ``and all other leases'' from 
the caption of these data items.
---------------------------------------------------------------------------

    \2\ Accounting Standards Codification paragraph 470-60-15-11.
---------------------------------------------------------------------------

    Thus, the proposed breakdowns of existing Memorandum item 1.b in 
both Schedule HC-C and Schedule HC-N would create new Memorandum items 
in both schedules covering troubled debt restructurings of 1-4 family 
residential construction loans, Other construction loans and all land 
development and other land loans, Loans secured by multifamily (5 or 
more) residential properties, Loans secured by owner-occupied nonfarm 
nonresidential properties, Loans secured by other nonfarm 
nonresidential properties, Commercial and industrial loans, and All 
other loans and all leases (including loans to individuals for 
household, family, and other personal expenditures). \3\ If 
restructured loans in any category of loans, as defined in Schedule HC-
C, included in restructured, All other loans, exceeds 10 percent of the 
amount of restructured, All other loans, the amount of restructured 
loans in this category or categories would be itemized and described.
---------------------------------------------------------------------------

    \3\ For BHCs with foreign offices, the Memorandum items for 
restructured real estate loans would cover such loans in domestic 
offices. In addition, BHCs would also provide a breakdown of 
restructured commercial and industrial loans between U.S. and non-
U.S. addressees.
---------------------------------------------------------------------------

    Finally, Schedule HC-C, Memorandum item 1, and Schedule HC-N, 
Memorandum item 1, are intended to capture data on loans that have 
undergone troubled debt restructurings as that term is defined in GAAP. 
However, the captions of these two Memorandum items include only the 
term ``restructured'' rather than explicitly mentioning troubled debt 
restructurings, which has led to questions about the scope of these 
Memorandum items. Accordingly, the Federal Reserve proposes to revise 
the captions so that they clearly indicate that the loans to be 
reported in Schedule HC-C, Memorandum item 1, and Schedule HC-N, 
Memorandum item 1, are troubled debt restructurings.
A.2 Auto Loans
    The Federal Reserve proposes to add a breakdown of the other 
consumer loans \4\ or all other loans loan categories contained in five 
separate schedules in order to separately collect information on auto 
loans. The affected schedules would be Schedule HC-C, Loans and Lease 
Financing Receivables; Schedule HC-K, Quarterly Averages; Schedule HC-
N, Past Due and Nonaccrual Loans, Leases, and Other Assets; Schedule 
HI, Income Statement; and Schedule HI-B, Part I, Charge-offs and 
Recoveries on Loans and Leases. Auto loans would include loans arising 
from retail sales of passenger cars and other vehicles such as 
minivans, vans, sport-utility vehicles, pickup trucks, and similar 
light trucks for personal use. This new loan category would exclude 
loans to finance fleet sales, personal cash loans secured by 
automobiles already paid for, loans to finance the purchase of 
commercial vehicles and farm equipment, and lease financing.
---------------------------------------------------------------------------

    \4\ As described later in this notice, the other consumer loans 
loan category is proposed to be added to Schedule HC-K beginning 
March 31, 2011.
---------------------------------------------------------------------------

    Automobile loans are a significant consumer business for many large 
BHCs. Because of the limited disclosure of auto lending on existing 
regulatory reports, supervisory oversight of auto lending is presently 
diminished by the need to rely on the examination process and public 
information sources that provide overall market information but not 
data on idiosyncratic risks.
    Roughly 65 percent of new vehicle sales and 40 percent of used 
vehicle sales are funded with auto loans. According to household 
surveys and data on loan originations, commercial banks are an 
important source of auto loans. In 2008, this sector originated 
approximately one-third of all auto loans. Finance companies, both 
independent and those affiliated with auto manufacturers, originated a 
bit more than one-third, while credit unions originated a bit less than 
one-quarter. In addition to originating auto loans, some banks purchase 
auto loans originated by other entities, which suggests that commercial 
banks could be the largest holder of auto loans.
    Despite the importance of BHCs to the auto loan market, the Federal 
Reserve knows less about BHCs' holdings of auto loans than is known 
about finance company, credit union, and savings association holdings 
of these loans. All nonbank depository institutions are required to 
report auto loans on their respective regulatory reports, including 
savings associations, which originate less than 5 percent of auto 
loans. On their regulatory reports, credit unions must provide not only 
the outstanding amount of new and used auto loans, but also the average 
interest rate and the number of loans. In a monthly survey, the Federal 
Reserve collects information on the amount of auto loans held by 
finance companies. As a consequence, during the financial crisis when 
funds were scarce for finance companies in general and the finance 
companies affiliated with automakers in particular, a lack of data on 
auto loans at banks hindered the Federal Reserve's ability to estimate 
the extent to which BHCs were filling in the gap in auto lending left 
by the finance companies.
    Additional disclosure regarding consolidated auto loans on the FR 
Y-9C is especially important with the implementation of the amendments 
to Financial Accounting Standards Board (FASB) Accounting Standards 
Codification (ASC) Topics 860, Transfers and Servicing, and 810, 
Consolidations, resulting from Accounting Standards Update (ASU) No. 
2009-16 \5\, and ASU No. 2009-17 \6\, respectively. Until 2010, 
Schedule HC-

[[Page 67724]]

S, Servicing, Securitization, and Asset Sale Activities, had provided 
the best supervisory information on auto lending because it included a 
separate breakout of securitized auto loans outstanding as well as 
securitized auto loan delinquencies and charge-offs. The accounting 
changes brought about by the amendments to ASC Topics 860 and 810, 
however, mean that if the auto loan securitization vehicle is now 
required to be consolidated, securitized auto lending previously 
reported on Schedule HC-S will be grouped as part of other consumer 
loans or all other loans on Schedules HC-C, HC-K, HC-N, HI, and HI-B, 
Part I, which diminishes supervisors' ability to assess auto loan 
exposures and performance.

No. 166, Accounting for Transfers of Financial Assets (FAS 166).
    \6\ Formerly SFAS No. 167, Amendments to FASB Interpretation No. 
46(R) (FAS 167).
---------------------------------------------------------------------------

    Finally, separating auto lending from other consumer loans will 
assist the Federal Reserve in understanding consumer lending activities 
at individual institutions. When an institution holds both auto loans 
and other types of consumer loans (other than credit cards, which are 
currently reported separately), the current combined reporting of these 
loans in the FR Y-9C tends to mask any significant differences that may 
exist in the performance of these portfolios. For example, a BHC could 
have a sizeable auto loan portfolio with low loan losses, but its other 
consumer lending, which could consist primarily of unsecured loans, 
could exhibit very high loss rates. The current blending of these 
divergent portfolios into a single loan category makes it difficult to 
adequately monitor consumer loan performance.
A.3 Commercial Mortgage Backed Securities Issued or Guaranteed by U.S. 
Government Agencies and Sponsored Agencies
    The Federal Reserve proposes to split the existing data items on 
commercial mortgage-backed securities (CMBS) in Schedule HC-B, 
Securities, and Schedule HC-D, Trading Assets and Liabilities, to 
distinguish between CMBS issued or guaranteed by U.S. Government 
agencies and sponsored agencies (collectively, U.S. Government 
agencies) and those issued by others. Until June 2009, information 
reported in the FR Y-9C on mortgage-backed securities (MBS) issued or 
guaranteed by U.S. Government agencies included both residential MBS 
and CMBS. However, in June 2009 when BHCs began to report information 
on CMBS separately from residential MBS, data was collected only for 
commercial mortgage pass-through securities and for other CMBS without 
regard to issuer or guarantor. Thus, the Federal Reserve was no longer 
able to identify all MBS issued or guaranteed by U.S. Government 
agencies.
    U.S. Government agencies issue or guarantee a significant volume of 
CMBS that are backed by multifamily residential properties. In the 
fourth quarter of 2009, out of a total of $854 billion in commercial 
and multifamily loans that were securitized, loan pools issued or 
guaranteed by U.S. Government agencies accounted for 19 percent or $164 
billion. These pools present a substantially different risk profile 
than privately issued CMBS, but current reporting does not allow for 
the identification of bank holdings of CMBS issued or guaranteed by 
U.S. Government agencies. In addition, because CMBS issued or 
guaranteed by U.S. Government agencies are accorded lower risk weights 
than CMBS issued by others, banks generally should have the information 
necessary to separately report these two categories of CMBS in the 
proposed new data items in Schedules HC-B and HC-D.
    Thus, in Schedule HC-B, the Federal Reserve proposes to split both 
data item 4.c.(1), Commercial mortgage pass-through securities, and 
data item 4.c.(2), Other commercial MBS, into separate data items for 
those issued or guaranteed by U.S. Government agencies (new data items 
4.c.(1)(a) and 4.c.(2)(a)) and all other CMBS (new data items 
4.c.(1)(b) and 4.c.(2)(b)). Similarly, in Schedule HC-D, existing data 
item 4.d, Commercial MBS, would be split into separate data items for 
CMBS issued or guaranteed by U.S. Government agencies (data item 
4.d.(1)) and all other CMBS (data item 4.d.(2)).
A.4 Variable Interest Entities
    In June 2009, the FASB issued accounting standards that have 
changed the way entities account for securitizations and special 
purpose entities. ASU No. 2009-16 (formerly FAS 166) revised ASC Topic 
860, Transfers and Servicing, by eliminating the concept of a 
qualifying special-purpose entity (QSPE) and changing the requirements 
for derecognizing financial assets. ASU No. 2009-17 (formerly FAS 167) 
revised ASC Topic 810, Consolidations, by changing how a banking 
organization or other company determines when an entity that is 
insufficiently capitalized or is not controlled through voting or 
similar rights, for example a VIE, should be consolidated. For most 
banking organizations, ASU Nos. 2009-16 and 2009-17 took effect January 
1, 2010.
    Under ASC Topic 810, as amended, determining whether a BHC is 
required to consolidate a VIE depends on a qualitative analysis of 
whether that BHC has a ``controlling financial interest'' in the VIE 
and is therefore the primary beneficiary of the VIE. The analysis 
focuses on the BHC's power over and interest in the VIE. With the 
removal of the QSPE concept from GAAP that was brought about in amended 
ASC Topic 860, a BHC that transferred financial assets to an SPE that 
met the definition of a QSPE before the effective date of these amended 
accounting standards was required to evaluate whether, pursuant to 
amended ASC Topic 810, it must begin to consolidate the assets, 
liabilities, and equity of the SPE as of that effective date. Thus, 
when implementing amended ASC Topics 860 and 810 at the beginning of 
2010, BHCs began to consolidate certain previously off-balance-sheet 
securitization vehicles, asset-backed commercial paper conduits, and 
other structures. Going forward, BHCs with variable interests in new 
VIEs must evaluate whether they have a controlling financial interest 
in these entities and, if so, consolidate them. In addition, BHCs must 
continually reassess whether they are the primary beneficiary of VIEs 
in which they have variable interests.
    For those VIEs that banks must consolidate, the Federal Reserve's 
FR Y-9C instructional guidance advises institutions to report the 
assets and liabilities of these VIEs on the balance sheet (Schedule HC) 
in the category appropriate to the asset or liability. However, ASC 
paragraph 810-10-45-25 \7\ requires a reporting entity to present 
``separately on the face of the statement of financial position: a. 
Assets of a consolidated variable interest entity (VIE) that can be 
used only to settle obligations of the consolidated VIE [and], b. 
Liabilities of a consolidated VIE for which creditors (or beneficial 
interest holders) do not have recourse to the general credit of the 
primary beneficiary.'' This requirement has been interpreted to mean 
that ``each line item of the consolidated balance sheet should 
differentiate which portion of those amounts meet the separate 
presentation conditions.'' \8\ In requiring separate presentation for 
these assets and liabilities, the FASB agreed with commenters on its 
proposed accounting standard on consolidation that ``separate 
presentation * * * would provide transparent and useful information 
about an enterprise's involvement and

[[Page 67725]]

associated risks in a variable interest entity.'' \9\ The Federal 
Reserve concurs that separate presentation would provide similar 
benefits to them and other FR Y-9C users, particularly since data on 
securitized assets that are reconsolidated is no longer reported on 
Schedule HC-S, Servicing, Securitization, and Asset Sale Activities.

    Consistent with the presentation requirements discussed above, the 
Federal Reserve proposes to add a new Schedule HC-V, Variable Interest 
Entities, to the FR Y-9C in which BHCs would report a breakdown of the 
assets of consolidated VIEs that can be used only to settle obligations 
of the consolidated VIEs and liabilities of consolidated VIEs for which 
creditors do not have recourse to the general credit of the reporting 
BHC. The following proposed categories for these assets and liabilities 
would include some of the same categories presented on the balance 
sheet (Schedule HC): (1) Cash and balances due from depository 
institutions, (2) Held-to-maturity securities, (3) Available-for-sale 
securities, (4) Securities purchased under agreements to resell, (5) 
Loans and leases held for sale, (6) Loans and leases, net of unearned 
income, (7) Less: Allowance for loan and lease losses, (8) Trading 
assets (other than derivatives), (9) Derivative assets, (10) Other real 
estate owned, (11) Other assets, (12) Securities sold under agreements 
to repurchase, (13) Derivative liabilities, (14) Other borrowed money 
(other than commercial paper), (15) Commercial paper, and (16) Other 
liabilities. These assets and liabilities would be presented separately 
for securitization trusts, asset-backed commercial paper conduits, and 
other VIEs.
    In addition, the Federal Reserve proposes to include two separate 
data items in new Schedule HC-V in which BHCs would report the total 
amounts of all other assets and all other liabilities of consolidated 
VIEs (i.e., all assets of consolidated VIEs that are not dedicated 
solely to settling obligations of the VIE and all liabilities of 
consolidated VIEs for which creditors have recourse to the general 
credit of the reporting BHC). The collection of this information would 
help the Federal Reserve understand the total magnitude of consolidated 
VIEs. These assets and liabilities would also be reported separately 
for securitization trusts, asset-backed commercial paper conduits, and 
other VIEs. The asset and liability information collected in Schedule 
HC-V would represent amounts included in the reporting BHC's 
consolidated assets and liabilities reported on Schedule HC, Balance 
Sheet, i.e., after eliminating intercompany transactions.
A.5 Assets Covered by FDIC Loss-Sharing Agreements
    In March 2010, the banking agencies added a four-way breakdown of 
assets covered by loss-sharing agreements with the FDIC to Call Report 
Schedule RC-M, Memoranda (and a comparable four-way breakdown was added 
to FR Y-9C Schedule HC-M, Memoranda). FR Y-9C data items 6.a through 
6.d collect data on covered loans and leases, other real estate owned, 
debt securities, and other assets. In a January 22, 2010, comment 
letter to the banking agencies on the agencies' submission for OMB 
review of proposed Call Report revisions for implementation in 2010, 
the American Bankers Association (ABA) stated that while the addition 
of the covered asset data items to Schedule RC-M was:

    A step in the right direction, ABA believes it would be 
beneficial to regulators, reporting banks, investors, and the public 
to have additional, more granular information about the various 
categories of assets subject to the FDIC loss-sharing agreements. 
While we recognize that this would result in additional reporting 
burden on banks, on balance our members feel strongly that the 
benefit of additional disclosure of loss-sharing data would outweigh 
the burden of providing these detailed data. Thus, we urge the 
Agencies and the FFIEC to further revise the collection of data from 
banks on assets covered by FDIC loss-sharing agreements on the Call 
Report to include the several changes suggested below. * * * We 
believe these changes would provide a more precise and accurate 
picture of a bank's asset quality.

    The changes suggested by the ABA included revising Call Report 
Schedule RC-M by replacing the two data items for covered loans and 
leases and covered other real estate owned with separate breakdowns of 
these assets by loan category and real estate category. The ABA also 
suggested revising existing data items 10 and 10.a in Schedule RC-N, 
Past Due and Nonaccrual Loans, Leases, and Other Assets, which collect 
data on past due and nonaccrual loans and leases that are wholly or 
partially guaranteed by the U.S. Government, including the FDIC. The 
ABA recommended that the reporting of these past due and nonaccrual 
loans and leases be segregated into separate data items for loans and 
leases covered by FDIC loss-sharing agreements and loans and leases 
with other U.S. Government guarantees.
    After reviewing the ABA's recommendations, the Federal Reserve 
proposes to make substantively similar revisions to the FR Y-9C. Thus, 
the Federal Reserve proposes to create a breakdown of Schedule HC-M, 
data item 6.a, covered Loans and leases, that would include each 
category of Loans secured by real estate (in domestic offices) from 
Schedule HC-C, Loans to finance agricultural production and other loans 
to farmers, Commercial and industrial loans, Credit cards, Other 
consumer loans, and All other loans and all leases. If any category of 
loans or leases, as defined in Schedule HC-C, included in covered All 
other loans and all leases exceeds 10 percent of total covered loans 
and leases, the amount of covered loans or leases in that category or 
categories must be itemized and described. Similarly, the Federal 
Reserve proposes to create a breakdown of Schedule HC-M, data item 6.b, 
covered Other real estate owned, into the following categories: 
Construction, land development, and other land, Farmland, 1-4 family 
residential properties, Multifamily (5 or more) residential properties, 
and Nonfarm nonresidential properties. BHCs would also report the 
guaranteed portion of the total amount of covered other real estate 
owned. In Schedule HC-N, as suggested by the ABA for the Call Report, 
the Federal Reserve proposes to remove loans and leases covered by FDIC 
loss-sharing agreements from the scope of existing data items 11 and 
11.a on past due and nonaccrual loans wholly or partially guaranteed by 
the U.S. Government. Past due and nonaccrual covered loans and leases 
would then be collected in new data item 12, which would include a 
breakdown of these loans and leases using the same categories as in 
proposed revised data item 6.a of Schedule HC-M.
A.6 Life Insurance Assets
    BHCs purchase and hold bank-owned life insurance (BOLI) policies as 
assets, the premiums for which may be used to acquire general account 
or separate account life insurance policies. BHCs currently report the 
aggregate amount of their life insurance assets in data item 5 of 
Schedule HC-F, Other Assets, without regard to whether their holdings 
are general account or separate account policies.
    Many BHCs have BOLI assets, and the distinction between those life 
insurance policies that represent general account products and those 
that represent separate account products has meaning with respect to 
the degree of credit risk involved as well as performance measures for 
the life insurance assets in a volatile market environment. In a 
general account policy, the general assets of the insurance company 
issuing

[[Page 67726]]

the policy support the policy's cash surrender value. In a separate 
account policy, the policyholder's cash surrender value is supported by 
assets segregated from the general assets of the insurance carrier. 
Under such an arrangement, the policyholder neither owns the underlying 
separate account created by the insurance carrier on its behalf nor 
controls investment decisions in the account. Nevertheless, the 
policyholder assumes all investment and price risk.
    A number of BHCs holding separate account life insurance policies 
have recorded significant losses in recent years due to the volatility 
in the markets and the vulnerability to market fluctuations of the 
instruments that are investment options in separate account life 
insurance policies. Information distinguishing between the cash 
surrender values of general account and separate account life insurance 
policies would allow the Federal Reserve to track BHCs' holdings of 
both types of life insurance policies with their differing risk 
characteristics and changes in their carrying amounts resulting from 
their performance over time. Accordingly, the Federal Reserve proposes 
to split data item 5 of Schedule HC-F into two data items: data item 
5.a, General account life insurance assets, and data item 5.b, Separate 
account life insurance assets.
A.7 Captive Insurance and Reinsurance Subsidiaries
    Captive insurance companies are utilized by banking organizations 
to ``self insure'' or reinsure their own risks pursuant to incidental 
activities authority. A captive insurance company is a limited purpose 
insurer that may be licensed as a direct writer of insurance or as a 
reinsurer. Insurance premiums paid by a BHC to its captive insurer, and 
claims paid back to the BHC by the captive, are transacted on an 
intercompany basis, so there is no evidence of this type of self-
insurance activity when a BHC prepares consolidated financial 
statements, including its FR Y-9C. The cash flows for a captive 
reinsurer's transactions also are not transparent in a BHC's 
consolidated financial statements.
    A number of BHCs own captive insurers or reinsurers, several of 
which were authorized to operate more than 10 years ago. Some of the 
most common lines of business underwritten by BHC captive insurers are 
credit life, accident and health, and disability insurance and employee 
benefits coverage. Additionally, BHC captive reinsurance subsidiaries 
may underwrite private mortgage guaranty reinsurance or terrorism risk 
reinsurance.
    As part of their supervisory processes, the Federal Reserve has 
been following the proliferation of BHC captive insurers and reinsurers 
and the performance trends of these captives for the past several 
years. Collection of financial information regarding the total assets 
of captive insurance and reinsurance subsidiaries would assist the 
agencies in monitoring the insurance activities of banking 
organizations as well as any safety and soundness risks posed to the 
parent BHC from the activities of these subsidiaries.
    The Federal Reserve proposes to collect two new data items in 
Schedule HC-M, Memoranda, for captive insurance subsidiaries operated 
by BHCs: Data item 7.a, Total assets of captive insurance subsidiaries, 
and data item 7.b, Total assets of captive reinsurance subsidiaries. 
These new data items are not expected to be applicable to the vast 
majority of BHCs. When reporting the total assets of these captive 
subsidiaries in the proposed new data items, BHCs should measure the 
subsidiaries' total assets before eliminating intercompany transactions 
between the consolidated subsidiary and other offices or subsidiaries 
of the consolidated BHC.
A.8 Credit and Debit Valuation Adjustments Included in Trading Revenues
    BHCs that reported average trading assets of $2 million or more for 
any quarter of the preceding calendar year provide a breakdown of 
trading revenue by type of exposure in Memorandum items 9.a through 9.e 
of Schedule HI, Income Statement. These revenue data items are reported 
net of credit adjustments made to the fair value of BHCs' derivative 
assets and liabilities that are reported as trading assets and 
liabilities.
    There are two forms of credit adjustments that affect the valuation 
of derivatives held for trading and trading revenue. The first is the 
credit valuation adjustment (CVA), which is the discounted value of 
expected losses on a BHC's derivative assets due to changes in the 
creditworthiness of the BHC's derivative counterparties and future 
exposures to those counterparties. In contrast, the debit valuation 
adjustment (DVA) reflects the effect of changes in the BHC's own 
creditworthiness on its derivative liabilities. During the financial 
crisis, the recognition of both the CVA and the DVA had a material 
affect on overall trading revenues. Because of their potential 
materiality, information on these two adjustments is needed in order 
for the Federal Reserve to better understand the level and trend of 
BHCs' trading revenues.
    The Federal Reserve therefore proposes to add two new Memorandum 
items to the existing Schedule HI Memorandum items for trading revenue. 
In new Memorandum item 9.f, BHCs would report the Impact on trading 
revenue of changes in the creditworthiness of the bank holding 
company's derivatives counterparties on the bank holding company's 
derivative assets (included in Memorandum items 9.a through 9.e above). 
In new Memorandum item 9.g., BHCs would report the Impact on trading 
revenue of changes in the creditworthiness of the bank holding company 
on the bank holding company's derivative liabilities (included in 
Memorandum items 9.a through 9.e above). Because derivatives held for 
trading are heavily concentrated in the very largest BHCs, these new 
data items would be reported only by BHCs with $100 billion or more in 
total assets.
A.9 Instructional Revisions
    1. Construction Loans:
    BHCs report the amount of their Construction, land development, and 
other land loans in the appropriate loan subcategory of Schedule HC-C, 
data item 1.a. Questions have arisen about the reporting treatment for 
a Construction, land development, and other land loan that was not 
originated as a ``combination construction-permanent loan,'' but was 
originated with the expectation that repayment would come from the sale 
of the real estate, when the BHC changes the loan's terms so that 
principal amortization is required. This may occur after completion of 
construction when the BHC renews or refinances the existing loan or 
enters into a new real estate loan with the original borrower. The 
Federal Reserve believes that as long as the repayment of a loan that 
was originally categorized as a Construction, land development, and 
other land loan remains dependent on the sale of the real property, the 
loan should continue to be reported in the appropriate subcategory of 
data item 1.a of Schedule HC-C because it continues to exhibit the risk 
characteristics of a construction loan.
    The instructions for Schedule HC-C, data item 1.a, state that:

    Loans written as combination construction-permanent loans 
secured by real estate should be reported in this item until 
construction is completed or principal amortization payments begin, 
whichever comes first. When the first of these events occurs, the 
loans should begin to be reported

[[Page 67727]]

in the real estate loan category in Schedule HC-C, data item 1, 
appropriate to the real estate collateral. All other construction 
loans secured by real estate should continue to be reported in this 
item after construction is completed unless and until (1) the loan 
is refinanced into a new permanent loan by the reporting bank 
holding company or is otherwise repaid, (2) the bank holding company 
acquires or otherwise obtains physical possession of the underlying 
collateral in full satisfaction of the debt, or (3) the loan is 
charged off.

    A combination construction-permanent loan results when the lender 
enters into a contractual agreement with the original borrower at the 
time the construction loan is originated to also provide the original 
borrower with permanent financing that amortizes principal after 
construction is completed and a certificate of occupancy is obtained 
(if applicable). This construction-permanent loan structure is intended 
to apply to situations where, at the time the construction loan is 
originated, the original borrower:
    <bullet> Is expected to be the owner-occupant of the property upon 
completion of construction and in receipt of a certificate of occupancy 
(if applicable), for example, where the financing is being provided to 
the original borrower for the construction and permanent financing of 
the borrower's residence or place of business or
    <bullet> Is not expected to be the owner-occupant of the property, 
but repayment of the permanent loan will be derived from rental income 
associated with the property being constructed after receipt of a 
certificate of occupancy (if applicable) rather than from the sale of 
the property being constructed.
    For a loan not written as a combination construction-permanent loan 
at the time the construction loan was originated, the Federal Reserve 
proposes to clarify the instructional language quoted above stating 
that ``[a]ll other construction loans secured by real estate should 
continue to be reported in this item after construction is completed 
unless and until * * * the loan is refinanced into a new permanent loan 
by the reporting bank holding company.'' This clarification is intended 
to ensure the appropriate categorization of such a loan in Schedule HC-
C. Thus, the Federal Reserve proposes to revise the instructions for 
Schedule HC-C, data item 1.a, to explain that the phrase ``the loan is 
refinanced into a new permanent loan'' refers to:
    <bullet> An amortizing permanent loan to a new borrower (unrelated 
to the original borrower) who has purchased the real property or
    <bullet> A prudently underwritten new amortizing permanent loan at 
market terms to the original borrower--including an appropriate 
interest rate, maturity, and loan-to-value ratio--that is no longer 
dependent on the sale of the property for repayment. The loan should 
have a clearly identified ongoing source of repayment sufficient to 
service the required principal and interest payments over a reasonable 
and customary period relative to the type of property securing the new 
loan. A new loan to the original borrower not meeting these criteria 
(including a new loan on interest-only terms or a new loan with a 
short-term balloon maturity that is inconsistent with the ongoing 
source of repayment criterion) should continue to be reported as a 
``Construction, land development, and other land loan'' in the 
appropriate subcategory of Schedule HC-C, data item 1.a.

2. Revisions Related to 1-4 Family Residential Mortgages Held for 
Trading in Schedule HC-P

    The Federal Reserve began collecting information in Schedule HC-P, 
1-4 Family Residential Mortgage Banking Activities in Domestic Offices, 
in September 2006. At that time, the instructions for Schedule HC-C, 
Loans and Lease Financing Receivables, were written to indicate that 
loans generally could not be classified as held for trading. Therefore, 
all 1-4 family residential mortgage loans designated as held for sale 
were reportable in Schedule HC-P. In March 2008, the Federal Reserve 
provided instructional guidance establishing conditions under which 
BHCs were permitted to classify certain assets (e.g., loans) as trading 
and specified that loans classified as trading assets should be 
excluded from Schedule HC-C, Loans and Lease Financing Receivables, and 
reported instead in Schedule HC-D, Trading Assets and Liabilities (if 
the reporting threshold for this schedule were met). However, the 
Federal Reserve neglected to address the reporting treatment on 
Schedule HC-P of 1-4 family residential loans that met the conditions 
for classification as trading assets. Therefore, the Federal Reserve 
proposes to correct this by providing explicit instructional guidance 
that all 1-4 family residential mortgage banking activities, whether 
held for sale or trading purposes, are reportable on Schedule HC-P.

3. Maturity and Repricing Data for Assets and Liabilities at 
Contractual Ceilings and Floors

    BHCs report maturity and repricing data for debt securities (not 
held for trading) in Schedule HC-B, Securities. The Federal Reserve 
uses these data to assess, at a broad level, a BHC's exposure to 
interest rate risk. The instructions for reporting the maturity and 
repricing data currently require that when the interest rate on a 
floating rate instrument has reached a contractual floor or ceiling 
level, which is a form of embedded option, the instrument is to be 
treated as fixed rate rather than floating rate until the rate is again 
free to float. As a result, a floating rate instrument whose interest 
rate has fallen to its floor or risen to its ceiling is reported based 
on the time remaining until its contractual maturity date rather than 
the time remaining until the next interest rate adjustment date (or the 
contractual maturity date, if earlier). This reporting treatment is 
designed to capture the potential effect of the embedded option under 
particular interest rate scenarios.
    The ABA has requested that the Federal Reserve reconsider the 
reporting treatment for floating rate instruments with contractual 
floors and ceilings. More specifically, the ABA has recommended that 
the instructions be revised so that floating rate instruments would 
always be reporting based on the time remaining until the next interest 
rate adjustment date without regard to whether the rate on the 
instrument has reached a contractual floor or ceiling.
    The Federal Reserve agrees that an instruction revision is 
warranted, but the extent of the revision should be narrower than 
recommended by the ABA. The Federal Reserve believes that when a 
floating rate instrument is at its contractual floor or ceiling and the 
embedded option has intrinsic value to the BHC, the floor or ceiling 
should be ignored and the instrument should be treated as a floating 
rate instrument. However, if the embedded option has intrinsic value to 
the BHC's counterparty, the contractual floor or ceiling should 
continue to be taken into account and the instrument should be treated 
as a fixed rate instrument. For example, when the interest rate on a 
floating rate loan reaches its contractual ceiling, the embedded option 
represented by the ceiling has intrinsic value to the borrower and is a 
detriment to the BHC because the loan's yield to the BHC is lower than 
what it would have been without the ceiling. When the interest rate on 
a floating rate loan reaches its contractual floor, the

[[Page 67728]]

embedded option represented by the floor has intrinsic value to the BHC 
and is a benefit to the BHC because the loan's yield to the BHC is 
higher than what it would have been without the floor.
    Accordingly, the Federal Reserve proposes to revise the 
instructions for reporting maturity and repricing data in Schedule HC-
B. As revised, the instructions would indicate that a floating rate 
asset that has reached its contractual ceiling and a floating rate 
liability that has reached its contractual floor would be treated as a 
fixed rate instrument and reported based on the time remaining until 
its contractual maturity date. In contrast, the instructions would 
state that a floating rate asset that has reached its contractual floor 
and a floating rate liability that has reached its contractual ceiling 
would be treated as a floating rate instrument and reported based on 
the time remaining until the next interest rate adjustment date (or the 
contractual maturity date, if earlier).
B. Proposed Revisions Not Related to Call Report Revisions
    The Federal Reserve proposes to make the following revisions to the 
FR Y-9C effective as of March 31, 2011. These proposed revisions are 
not related to the revisions proposed to the Call Report.

B.1 Expanding Information Collected on Schedule HC-K, Quarterly 
Averages

    The Federal Reserve proposes to expand the information collected on 
Schedule HC-K, Quarterly Averages, to collect more detailed breakdowns 
on securities and loan portfolios, consistent with information 
currently reported by commercial banks on Call Report Schedule RC-K, 
Quarterly Averages. Specifically, Schedule HC-K, data item 2, 
Securities, would be broken out to provide information on (1) U.S. 
Treasury securities and U.S. Government agency obligations (excluding 
mortgage-backed securities), (2) Mortgage-backed securities, and (3) 
All other securities. Also, new loan categories would be added to 
Schedule HC-K, data item 6, Loans, to provide information on (1) Loans 
to finance agricultural production and other loans to farmers, (2) 
Commercial and industrial loans, and (3) Loans to individuals for 
household, family, and other personal expenditures, with a breakdown of 
(a) Credit cards, (b) Auto loans, and (c) Other.
    A more granular breakdown on securities and loan portfolios would 
facilitate analysis when the value or size of a firm's assets has 
changed or fluctuated over a quarter, particularly when used to 
calculate net charge-off, growth, and return on average asset rates. 
Disclosure of this information would also be consistent with firms' 
public Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) filings, where net 
charge-off rates by product type are calculated using quarterly average 
balances.

Proposed Revisions--FR Y-9LP

    The Federal Reserve proposes to make the following revision to the 
FR Y-9LP effective as of March 31, 2011.

Troubled Debt Restructurings

    To be consistent with revisions proposed for the FR Y-9C, the 
Federal Reserve proposes to modify the instructions for Schedule PC-B--
Memoranda item 8, Loans and leases of the parent restructured in 
compliance with modified terms, to clearly indicate that the loans to 
be reported in this data item should be troubled debt restructurings 
and to exclude leases. Also the phrase ``and leases'' would be stricken 
from the caption of this data item. Under GAAP, troubled debt 
restructurings do not include changes in lease agreements. Also 
consistent with the proposed change to the FR Y-9C, the Federal Reserve 
proposes to revise the instructions for this data item to include 
(currently excluded) loans to individuals for household, family, and 
other personal expenditures and all loans secured by 1-4 family 
residential properties whose terms have been modified in troubled debt 
restructurings.
    2. Report title: Financial Statements for Nonbank Subsidiaries of 
U.S. Bank Holding Companies.
    Agency form number: FR Y-11.
    OMB control number: 7100-0244.
    Frequency: Quarterly and annually.
    Reporters: Bank holding companies.
    Annual reporting hours: FR Y-11 (quarterly): 15,966; FR Y-11 
(annual): 2,768.
    Estimated average hours per response: FR Y-11 (quarterly): 6.80; FR 
Y-11 (annual): 6.80.
    Number of respondents: FR Y-11 (quarterly): 587; FR Y-11 (annual): 
407.
    General description of report: This information collection is 
mandatory (12 U.S.C. 1844(c)). Confidential treatment is not routinely 
given to the data in these reports. However, confidential treatment for 
the reporting information, in whole or in part, can be requested in 
accordance with the instructions to the form, pursuant to sections 
(b)(4), (b)(6) and (b)(8) of the Freedom of Information Act [5 U.S.C. 
522(b)(4), (b)(6) and (b)(8)].
    Abstract: The FR Y-11 reports collect financial information for 
individual non-functionally regulated U.S. nonbank subsidiaries of 
domestic bank holding companies (BHCs). BHCs file the FR Y-11 on a 
quarterly or annual basis according to filing criteria. The FR Y-11 
data are used with other BHC data to assess the condition of BHCs that 
are heavily engaged in nonbanking activities and to monitor the volume, 
nature, and condition of their nonbanking operations.
    Current Actions: The Federal Reserve proposes to revise the FR Y-11 
reporting form and instructions to clarify the reporting of the net 
change in fair values of financial instruments accounted for under a 
fair value option. The Federal Reserve proposes to revise the item 
caption for Schedule IS, Income Statement, Memorandum item 2, Net 
change in fair values of financial instruments accounted for under a 
fair value option, by adding the parenthetical (included in items 
5.a.(3), 5.a.(6), 5.a.(10) and 5.b. above). Schedule IS, Memoranda item 
2 instructions currently state that respondents only include net change 
in fair value included in noninterest income from nonrelated 
organizations. However, respondents should also include the net change 
in fair value included in trading revenue, net servicing fees, and 
other noninterest income from nonrelated and related organizations. The 
Federal Reserve would also make the corresponding instructional 
revision.
    To be consistent with revisions proposed to the FR Y-9C, the 
Federal Reserve also proposes to clarify the caption for Schedule BS-A, 
Loans and Lease Financing Receivables, data item 7.d, Restructured 
loans and leases, to clearly indicate that the loans to be reported in 
this item should be troubled debt restructurings and to exclude leases. 
Under generally accepted accounting principles, troubled debt 
restructurings do not include changes in lease agreements. Also 
consistent with the proposed change to the FR Y-9C, The Federal Reserve 
proposes to revise the instructions for this item to include (currently 
excluded) loans to individuals for household, family, and other 
personal expenditures, and all loans secured by 1-4 family residential 
properties whose terms have been modified in troubled debt 
restructurings. These revisions would be effective as of March 31, 
2011.
    3. Report title: Financial Statements of Foreign Subsidiaries of 
U.S. Banking Organizations.
    Agency form number: FR 2314.
    OMB control number: 7100-0073.
    Frequency: Quarterly and annually.

[[Page 67729]]

    Reporters: Foreign subsidiaries of U.S. state member banks, bank 
holding companies, and Edge or agreement corporations.
    Annual reporting hours: FR 2314 (quarterly): 16,394; FR 2314 
(annual): 3,379.
    Estimated average hours per response: FR 2314 (quarterly): 6.60; FR 
2314 (annual): 6.60.
    Number of respondents: FR 2314 (quarterly): 621; FR 2314 (annual): 
512.
    General description of report: This information collection is 
mandatory (12 U.S.C. 324, 602, 625, and 1844(c)). Confidential 
treatment is not routinely given to the data in these reports. However, 
confidential treatment for the reporting information, in whole or in 
part, can be requested in accordance with the instructions to the form, 
pursuant to sections (b)(4), (b)(6) and (b)(8) of the Freedom of 
Information Act [5 U.S.C. 522(b)(4) (b)(6) and (b)(8)].
    Abstract: The FR 2314 reports collect financial information for 
non-functionally regulated direct or indirect foreign subsidiaries of 
U.S. state member banks (SMBs), Edge and agreement corporations, and 
BHCs. Parent organizations (SMBs, Edge and agreement corporations, or 
BHCs) file the FR 2314 on a quarterly or annual basis according to 
filing criteria. The FR 2314 data are used to identify current and 
potential problems at the foreign subsidiaries of U.S. parent 
companies, to monitor the activities of U.S. banking organizations in 
specific countries, and to develop a better understanding of activities 
within the industry, in general, and of individual institutions, in 
particular.
    Current actions: The Federal Reserve proposes to revise the FR 2314 
reporting form and instructions to clarify the reporting of the net 
change in fair values of financial instruments accounted for under a 
fair value option. The Federal Reserve proposes to revise the item 
caption for Schedule IS, Income Statement, Memorandum item 2, Net 
change in fair values of financial instruments accounted for under a 
fair value option, by adding the parenthetical (included in items 
5.a.(3), 5.a.(6), 5.a.(10) and 5.b. above). Schedule IS, Memoranda item 
2 instructions currently state that respondents only include net change 
in fair value included in noninterest income from nonrelated 
organizations. However, respondents should also include the net change 
in fair value included in trading revenue, net servicing fees, and 
other noninterest income from nonrelated and related organizations. The 
Federal Reserve would also make the corresponding instructional 
revision.
    To be consistent with revisions proposed to the FR Y-9C, the 
Federal Reserve also proposes to clarify the caption for Schedule BS-A, 
Loans and Lease Financing Receivables, data item 7.d, Restructured 
loans and leases, to clearly indicate that the loans to be reported in 
this item should be troubled debt restructurings and to exclude leases. 
Under generally accepted accounting principles, troubled debt 
restructurings do not include changes in lease agreements. Also 
consistent with the proposed change to the FR Y-9C, The Federal Reserve 
proposes to revise the instructions for this item to include (currently 
excluded) loans to individuals for household, family, and other 
personal expenditures, and all loans secured by 1-4 family residential 
properties whose terms have been modified in troubled debt 
restructurings. These revisions would be effective as of March 31, 
2011.
    4. Report title: Financial Statements of U.S. Nonbank Subsidiaries 
Held by Foreign Banking Organizations.
    Agency form number: FR Y-7N.
    OMB control number: 7100-0125.
    Frequency: Quarterly and annually.
    Reporters: Foreign banking organizations (FBOs).
    Annual reporting hours: FR Y-7N (quarterly): 4,978; FR Y-7N 
(annual): 1,299.
    Estimated average hours per response: FR Y-7N (quarterly): 6.80; FR 
Y-7N (annual): 6.80.
    Number of respondents: FR Y-7N (quarterly): 183; FR Y-7N (annual): 
191.
    General description of report: This information collection is 
mandatory (12 U.S.C. 1844(c), 3106(c), and 3108). Confidential 
treatment is not routinely given to the data in these reports. However, 
confidential treatment for information, in whole or in part, on any of 
the reporting forms can be requested in accordance with the 
instructions to the form, pursuant to sections (b)(4) and (b)(6) of the 
Freedom of Information Act [5 U.S.C. 522(b)(4) and (b)(6)].
    Abstract: The FR Y-7N collects financial information for non-
functionally regulated U.S. nonbank subsidiaries held by FBOs other 
than through a U.S. bank holding company (BHC), U.S. financial holding 
company (FHC) or U.S. bank. FBOs file the FR Y-7N on a quarterly or 
annual basis.
    Current actions: The Federal Reserve proposes to revise the FR Y-7N 
reporting form and instructions to clarify the reporting of the net 
change in fair values of financial instruments accounted for under a 
fair value option. The Federal Reserve proposes to revise the item 
caption for Schedule IS, Income Statement, Memoranda item 1, Net change 
in fair values of financial instruments accounted for under a fair 
value option, by adding the parenthetical (included in items 5.a.(3), 
5.a.(6), 5.a.(10) and 5.b. above). Schedule IS, Memoranda item 1, 
instructions currently state that respondents only include net change 
in fair value included in noninterest income from nonrelated 
organizations. However, respondents should include the net change in 
fair value included in trading revenue, net servicing fees, and other 
noninterest income from nonrelated and related organizations. The 
Federal Reserve would also make the corresponding instructional 
revision.
    To be consistent with revisions proposed to the FR Y-9C, the 
Federal Reserve also proposes to clarify the caption for Schedule BS-A, 
Loans and Lease Financing Receivables, data item 7.d, Restructured 
loans and leases, to clearly indicate that the loans to be reported in 
this data item should be troubled debt restructurings and to exclude 
leases. Under generally accepted accounting principles, troubled debt 
restructurings do not include changes in lease agreements. Also 
consistent with the proposed change to the FR Y-9C, The Federal Reserve 
proposes to revise the instructions for this item to include (currently 
excluded) loans to individuals for household, family, and other 
personal expenditures, and all loans secured by 1-4 family residential 
properties whose terms have been modified in troubled debt 
restructurings. These revisions would be effective as of March 31, 
2011.
    5. Report title: Consolidated Report of Condition and Income for 
Edge and Agreement Corporations.
    Agency form number: FR 2886b.
    OMB control number: 7100-0086.
    Frequency: Quarterly.
    Reporters: Edge and agreement corporations.
    Annual reporting hours: 1,679.
    Estimated average hours per response: 15.15 banking corporations, 
9.60 investment corporations.
    Number of respondents: 13 banking corporations, 42 investment 
corporations.
    General description of report: This information collection is 
mandatory (12 U.S.C. 602 and 625). Schedules RC-M (with the exception 
of item 3) and RC-V are held as confidential pursuant to section (b)(4) 
of the Freedom of Information Act (5 U.S.C. 552 (b)(4)).
    Abstract: The mandatory FR 2886b comprises a balance sheet, income

[[Page 67730]]

statement, two schedules reconciling changes in capital and reserve 
accounts, and 11 supporting schedules and it parallels the Consolidated 
Reports of Condition and Income (Call Report) (FFIEC 031 and FFIEC 041; 
OMB No. 7100-0036) that commercial banks file. The Federal Reserve uses 
the data collected on the FR 2886b to supervise Edge corporations, 
identify present and potential problems, and monitor and develop a 
better understanding of activities within the industry.
    Current actions: The Federal Reserve proposes to revise the FR 
2886b reporting form and instructions to clarify the reporting of the 
net change in fair values of financial instruments accounted for under 
a fair value option. The Federal Reserve proposes to revise the item 
caption for Schedule RI, Income Statement, Memoranda item 1, Net change 
in fair values of financial instruments accounted for under a fair 
value option, by changing the parenthetical from (included in item 
5.a.(6) above) to (included in items 5.a.(6) and 5.b. above). Schedule 
RI, Memoranda item 1 currently states that respondents only include net 
change in fair value included in noninterest income from nonrelated 
organizations. However, respondents may elect to apply the fair value 
option to instruments with nonrelated and related organizations. The 
Federal Reserve would also make the corresponding instructional 
revision.
    To be consistent with revisions proposed for the FR Y-9C, the 
Federal Reserve also proposes to revise the caption for Schedule RC-N, 
Past Due and Nonaccrual Loans, Leases, and Other Assets, Memorandum 
item 1, Restructured loans and leases, to clearly indicate that the 
loans to be reported in this item should be troubled debt 
restructurings and to exclude leases. Under generally accepted 
accounting principles, troubled debt restructurings do not include 
changes in lease agreements. Also consistent with the proposed change 
to the FR Y-9C, the Federal Reserve proposes to revise the instructions 
for this item to include (currently excluded) loans to individuals for 
household, family, and other personal expenditures, and all loans 
secured by 1-4 family residential properties whose terms have been 
modified in troubled debt restructurings. These revisions would be 
effective as of March 31, 2011.
    Proposal to approve under OMB delegated authority the extension for 
three years, without revision of the following reports:

(b)(4) and (b)(6) of the Freedom of Information Act (5 U.S.C. 
522(b)(4), (b)(6)).
    Abstract: The FR Y-9SP is a parent company only financial statement 
filed by smaller BHCs. Respondents include BHCs with total consolidated 
assets of less than $500 million. This form is a simplified or 
abbreviated version of the more extensive parent company only financial 
statement for large BHCs (FR Y-9LP). This report is designed to obtain 
basic balance sheet and income information for the parent company, 
information on intangible assets, and information on intercompany 
transactions.
    The FR Y-9ES collects financial information from ESOPs that are 
also BHCs on their benefit plan activities. It consists of four 
schedules: Statement of Changes in Net Assets Available for Benefits, 
Statement of Net Assets Available for Benefits, Memoranda, and Notes to 
the Financial Statements. The FR Y-9CS is a supplemental report that 
may be utilized to collect additional information deemed to be critical 
and needed in an expedited manner from BHCs. The information is used to 
assess and monitor emerging issues related to BHCs. It is intended to 
supplement the FR Y-9 reports, which are used to monitor BHCs between 
on-site inspections. The data items of information included on the 
supplement may change as needed.
