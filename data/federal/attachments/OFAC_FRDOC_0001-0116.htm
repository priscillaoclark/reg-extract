Background

    On September 23, 2001, the President issued Executive Order 13224 
(the ``Order'') pursuant to the International Emergency Economic Powers 
Act, 50 U.S.C. 1701-1706, and the United Nations Participation Act of 
1945, 22 U.S.C. 287c, imposing economic sanctions on persons who 
commit, threaten to commit, or support acts of terrorism. The President 
identified in the Annex to the Order various individuals and entities 
as subject to the economic sanctions. The Order authorizes the 
Secretary of the Treasury, in consultation with the Secretary of State, 
the Attorney General, and (pursuant to Executive Order 13284) the 
Secretary of the Department of Homeland Security, to designate 
additional persons or entities determined to meet certain criteria set 
forth in Executive Order 13224.
    One such additional person was designated by the Secretary of the 
Treasury on October 12, 2001. The Department of the Treasury's Office 
of Foreign Assets Control has determined that this individual no longer 
continues to meet the criteria for designation under the Order and is 
appropriate for removal from the list of Specially Designated Nationals 
and Blocked Persons.
    The following designation is removed from the list of Specially 
Designated Nationals and Blocked Persons:

    ZIA, Mohammad (a.k.a. ZIA, Ahmad), c/o Ahmed Shah s/o Painda 
Mohammad al-Karim Set, Peshawar, Pakistan; c/o Alam General Store 
Shop 17, Awami Market, Peshawar, Pakistan; c/o Zahir Shah s/o Murad 
Khan Ander Sher, Peshawar, Pakistan (individual) [SDGT]

    The removal of the individual's name from the list of Specially 
Designated Nationals and Blocked Persons is effective as of March 2, 
2010. All property and interests in property of the individual that are 
in or hereafter come within the United States or the possession or 
control of United States persons are now unblocked.

    Dated: March 2, 2010.
Barbara C. Hammerle,
Acting Director, Office of Foreign Assets Control.
