SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION:

[[Page 25131]]

Background

    The Convention on Cultural Property Implementation Act (Pub. L. 97-
446, 19 U.S.C. 2601 et seq.) (CPIA), which implements the 1970 United 
Nations Educational, Scientific and Cultural Organization (UNESCO) 
Convention on the Means of Prohibiting and Preventing the Illicit 
Import, Export and Transfer of Ownership of Cultural Property (823 
U.N.T.S. 231 (1972)) (Convention), allows for the conclusion of an 
agreement between the United States and another party to the Convention 
to impose import restrictions on certain archaeological and 
ethnological material. Pursuant to the CPIA, the United States entered 
into a bilateral agreement with the Islamic Republic of Pakistan 
(Pakistan) to impose import restrictions on certain archaeological and 
ethnological material of Pakistan. This rule announces that the United 
States is now imposing import restrictions on certain archaeological 
and ethnological material of Pakistan through January 30, 2029. This 
period may be extended for additional periods, each extension not to 
exceed 5 years, if it is determined that the factors justifying the 
initial agreement still pertain and no cause for suspension of the 
agreement exists (19 U.S.C. 2602(e); Sec.  12.104g(a) of title 19 of 
the Code of Federal Regulations (19 CFR 12.104g(a))).

Determinations

    Under 19 U.S.C. 2602(a)(1), the United States must make certain 
determinations before entering into an agreement to impose import 
restrictions under 19 U.S.C. 2602(a)(2). On August 29, 2022, the 
Assistant Secretary for Educational and Cultural Affairs, United States 
Department of State, after consultation with and recommendation by the 
Cultural Property Advisory Committee, made the determinations required 
under the statute with respect to certain archaeological and 
ethnological material originating in Pakistan that is described in the 
Designated List set forth below in this document.
    These determinations include the following: (1) that the cultural 
patrimony of Pakistan is in jeopardy from the pillage of archaeological 
material representing Pakistan's cultural heritage dating from 
approximately 2,000,000 Years Before Present \1\ to A.D. 1750, and 
ethnological material representing Pakistan's diverse history, ranging 
in date from approximately A.D. 800 to 1849 (19 U.S.C. 2602(a)(1)(A)); 
(2) that the Pakistani government has taken measures consistent with 
the Convention to protect its cultural patrimony (19 U.S.C. 
2602(a)(1)(B)); (3) that import restrictions imposed by the United 
States would be of substantial benefit in deterring a serious situation 
of pillage and remedies less drastic are not available (19 U.S.C. 
2602(a)(1)(C)); and (4) that the application of import restrictions as 
set forth in this final rule is consistent with the general interests 
of the international community in the interchange of cultural property 
among nations for scientific, cultural, and educational purposes (19 
U.S.C. 2602(a)(1)(D)). The Assistant Secretary also found that the 
material described in the determinations meets the statutory definition 
of ``archaeological or ethnological material of the State Party'' (19 
U.S.C. 2601(2)).
---------------------------------------------------------------------------

    \1\ ``Years Before Present'' is commonly used instead of 
``B.C.'' or ``A.D.'' within archaeology when radiocarbon dating or 
other similar dating techniques are utilized.
---------------------------------------------------------------------------

The Agreement

    On January 30, 2024, the Governments of the United States and 
Pakistan signed a bilateral agreement, ``Agreement Between the 
Government of the United States of America and the Government of the 
Islamic Republic of Pakistan Concerning the Imposition of Import 
Restrictions on Categories of Archaeological and Ethnological Materials 
of Pakistan'' (``the Agreement''), pursuant to the provisions of 19 
U.S.C. 2602(a)(2). The Agreement entered into force on January 30, 
2024, following the exchange of diplomatic notes, and enables the 
promulgation of import restrictions on certain categories of 
archaeological material ranging in date from the Lower Paleolithic 
Period (approximately 2,000,000 Years Before Present) through A.D. 
1750, as well as certain categories of ethnological material associated 
with Pakistan's diverse history from A.D. 800 through 1849. A list of 
the categories of archaeological and ethnological material subject to 
the import restrictions is set forth later in this document.

Restrictions and Amendment to the Regulations

    In accordance with the Agreement, importation of material 
designated below is subject to the restrictions of 19 U.S.C. 2606 and 
19 CFR 12.104g(a) and will be restricted from entry into the United 
States unless the conditions set forth in 19 U.S.C. 2606 and 19 CFR 
12.104c are met. CBP is amending 19 CFR 12.104g(a) to indicate that 
these import restrictions have been imposed.
    Import restrictions listed at 19 CFR 12.104g(a) are effective for 
no more than 5 years beginning on the date on which an agreement enters 
into force with respect to the United States. This period may be 
extended for additional periods of not more than 5 years if it is 
determined that the factors which justified the agreement still pertain 
and no cause for suspension of the agreement exists. Therefore, the 
import restrictions will expire on January 30, 2029, unless extended.

Designated List of Archaeological and Ethnological Material of Pakistan

    The Agreement between the United States and Pakistan includes, but 
is not limited to, the categories of objects described in the

Inapplicability of Notice and Delayed Effective Date

    This amendment involves a foreign affairs function of the United 
States and is, therefore, being made without notice or public procedure 
(5 U.S.C. 553(a)(1)). For the same reason, a delayed effective date is 
not required under 5 U.S.C. 553(d)(3).

Executive Orders 12866 and 13563

    Executive Orders 12866 (as amended by Executive Order 14094) and 
13563 direct agencies to assess the costs and benefits of available 
regulatory alternatives and, if regulation is necessary, to select 
regulatory approaches that maximize net benefits (including potential 
economic, environmental, public health and safety effects, distributive 
impacts, and equity). Executive Order 13563 emphasizes the importance 
of quantifying both costs and benefits, of reducing costs, of 
harmonizing rules, and of promoting flexibility. CBP has determined 
that this document is not a regulation or rule subject to the 
provisions of Executive Orders 12866 and 13563 because it pertains to a 
foreign affairs function of the United States, as described above, and 
therefore is specifically exempted by section 3(d)(2) of Executive 
Order 12866 and, by extension, Executive Order 13563.

Regulatory Flexibility Act

    The Regulatory Flexibility Act (5 U.S.C. 601 et seq.), as amended 
by the Small Business Regulatory Enforcement Fairness Act of 1996, 
requires an agency to prepare and make available to the public a 
regulatory flexibility analysis that describes the effect of a proposed 
rule on small entities (i.e., small businesses, small organizations, 
and small governmental jurisdictions) when the agency is required to 
publish a general notice of proposed rulemaking for a rule. Since a 
general notice of proposed rulemaking is not necessary for this rule, 
CBP is not required to prepare a regulatory flexibility analysis for 
this rule.

Signing Authority

    This regulation is being issued in accordance with 19 CFR 0.1(a)(1) 
pertaining to the Secretary of the Treasury's authority (or that of the 
Secretary's delegate) to approve regulations related to customs revenue

    Troy A. Miller, the Senior Official Performing the Duties of the 
Commissioner, having reviewed and approved this document, has delegated 
the authority to electronically sign this document to the Director (or 
Acting Director, if applicable) of the Regulations and Disclosure Law 
Division for CBP, for purposes of publication in the Federal Register.
