Board is directed to take every reasonable step to solicit comment. In 
determining whether to approve a collection of information, the Board 
will consider all comments received from the public and other agencies.
    During the comment period for this proposal, a copy of the proposed 
PRA OMB submission, including the draft reporting form and 
instructions, supporting statement (which contains more detail about 
the information collection and burden estimates than this notice), and 
other documentation, will be made available on the Board's public

Request for Comment on Information Collection Proposal

    The Board invites public comment on the following information 
collection, which is being reviewed under authority delegated by the 
OMB under the PRA. Comments are invited on the following:
    a. Whether the proposed collection of information is necessary for 
the proper performance of the Board's functions, including whether the 
information has practical utility;
    b. The accuracy of the Board's estimate of the burden of the 
proposed information collection, including the validity of the 
methodology and assumptions used;
    c. Ways to enhance the quality, utility, and clarity of the 
information to be collected;
    d. Ways to minimize the burden of information collection on 
respondents, including through the use of automated collection 
techniques or other forms of information technology; and
    e. Estimates of capital or startup costs and costs of operation, 
maintenance, and purchase of services to provide information.
    At the end of the comment period, the comments and recommendations 
received will be analyzed to determine the extent to which the Board 
should modify the proposal.

Without Revision, the Following Information Collection

    Collection identifier: FR 3066.
    OMB control number: 7100-0351.
    General description of collection: The Federal Reserve Payments 
Study (FRPS) is supported by the following surveys: Depository and 
Financial Institutions Payments Survey (FR 3066a), and Networks,

payments, as well as cash withdrawals and deposits, made by U.S. 
consumers and businesses, including for-profit and not-for-profit 
enterprises, and federal, state, and local government agencies. The 
aggregate estimates produced from the survey data are widely cited in 
academic working papers, journal articles, and industry publications; 
reported in the media; and used by the public, industry, and policy 
makers as a quantitative aggregate benchmark of noncash payments and 
cash withdrawal and deposit activity in the United States.
    Frequency: Annually.
    Respondents: Organizations with a significant role in processing 
payments, including depository and financial institutions, general-
purpose payment networks, third-party payment processors, issuers of 
private-label payment instruments, and providers of various alternative 
payment methods and systems.
    Total estimated number of respondents: FR 3066a, 513, FR 3066b, 
170.
    Estimated average hours per response: FR 3066a, 22; FR 3066b, 8.
    Total estimated annual burden hours: 12,646.

    Board of Governors of the Federal Reserve System, July 24, 2024.
