Incorporation of Changes in the Commission's Administrative 
Structure, Remove Superfluous Verbiage, and Correct Inaccurate Text

AGENCY: Commodity Futures Trading Commission.

ACTION: Final rule.

-----------------------------------------------------------------------

SUMMARY: The agency's Divisions and Offices have been reorganized at 
the Chairman's direction, and with prior notification to relevant 
congressional committees. To ensure the CFR reflects these changes, the 
Commodity Futures Trading Commission (Commission or CFTC) is voting to 
make technical changes to various provisions within its regulations in 
order to align with its change in administrative structure, remove 
superfluous verbiage, and correct inaccurate text. In addition to the 
administrative changes required due to the realignment, the Commission 
is adopting technical changes to ensure consistency in reference to 
Commission addresses, deleting references to positions that have 
changed and updating the positions to align with the current Commission 
structure, correct typographical errors, and other technical changes.

DATES: These amendments are effective on September 4, 2024.

SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION:

I. Background

    An agency reorganization in November 2020 realigned key functions 
within the agency, including: (1) creating a new Division of Data 
(DOD); (2) reassigning the Executive Secretariat Branch from the Office 
of the Executive Director (OED) to the Office of the General Counsel 
(OGC); and (3) renaming and realigning the Division of Swap Dealer and 
Intermediary Oversight (DSIO) to the Market Participants Division (MPD) 
and (4) moving the Office of Customer Education and Outreach (OCEO) to 
the Office of Public Affairs.
    Technology has dramatically altered capital and commodity markets 
over the past few decades, and technologically induced innovations such 
as electronic exchanges, high-frequency trading, and exchange-traded 
funds have made trading faster, cheaper, more integrated, and 
increasingly complex. As a financial regulator in an ever-increasingly 
sophisticated market environment, it is becoming more and more crucial 
that the CFTC continue to focus on data and data reporting and invest 
in technologies necessary to keep pace with market innovation. Our 
oversight responsibilities are becoming highly data acquisitive and 
rely on the effective use of information, including through the use of 
algorithms and analytics to more effectively manage data to meet our 
regulatory objectives. The DoD was created to address the Commission's 
growing data needs and to position the agency to continue to achieve 
its mission in accord with new technologies.
    There has been an unprecedented rise in retail futures, options and 
digital asset trading. As the agency evolves to address changing 
markets and market demographics, both the FinTech and customer 
protection efforts the Office of Customer Education and Outreach (OCEO) 
were realigned within the Office of Public Affairs.
    DSIO is responsible primarily for overseeing derivatives market 
participants and market intermediaries, including commodity pool 
operators, commodity trading advisors, futures commission merchants, 
introducing brokers, retail foreign exchange dealers, swap dealers, and 
major swap participants, as well as designated self-regulatory 
organizations. By restyling DSIO as MPD, the Division's name will more 
succinctly reflect the scope of its responsibility regarding the 
Commission registrants enumerated above.
    The Commission's legal compliance groups that are responsible for 
records, Freedom of Information Act, Sunshine Act, privacy, and 
transparency were divided between the Office of the General Counsel and 
the Executive Secretariat Branch in the Office of the Executive 
Director. Moving the Executive Secretariat Branch into the Office of 
the General Counsel ensures consistency through streamlining all legal 
compliance programs into one division.
    In addition to the changes required due to the realignment, the 
Commission proposes technical changes to ensure consistency in 
reference to addresses, deletes references to positions that have 
changed and updates the positions to align with the current Commission 
structure, correct typographical errors, and other technical changes.
    Section 2(a)(12) of the Commodity Exchange Act authorizes the

[[Page 71804]]

Commission to promulgate such rules and regulations as it deems 
necessary to govern the operating procedures and conduct of business of 
the Commission. The Commission is promulgating this rule to reflect 
changes in its administrative structure and to make conforming 
technical changes to its regulations.

II. Related Matters

A. Administrative Procedure Act

    The amendments to the Commission's regulations in this rulemaking 
do not establish any new substantive or legislative rules, but rather 
relate to the restructuring of responsibilities within the Commission, 
including amendments changing the names of divisions and offices that 
are affected by the realignment and re-delegating authority to newly 
formed divisions. The amendments to the Commission's regulations relate 
solely to agency management, organization, procedure, and practice and 
provide technical corrections of a minor and administrative nature, 
such as technical changes to ensure consistency in reference to 
Commission addresses, to delete references to positions that have 
changed and to update the positions to align with the current 
Commission structure, correct typographical errors, and other similar 
technical corrections. Therefore, this rulemaking is excepted from the 
public rulemaking provisions of the Administrative Procedure Act.\1\ 
Additionally, an agency may issue a new rule in some circumstances 
without publication in the Federal Register of a notice of proposed 
rulemaking with an opportunity for comment if the agency for ``good 
cause'' finds (and incorporates the finding and a brief statement of 
the reasons therefor in the rules issued) that notice and public 
procedure thereon are impracticable, unnecessary, or contrary to the 
public interest.\2\ As the revisions to the Commission's regulations in 
this rulemaking will not cause any party to undertake efforts to comply 
with the regulations as revised, the Commission has determined to make 
this rulemaking effective upon publication in the Federal Register.\3\
---------------------------------------------------------------------------

    \1\ 5 U.S.C. 553(a) and (b). Rulemaking procedures apply, except 
to the extent that there is involved (1) a military or foreign 
affairs function of the United States; or (2) a matter relating to 
agency management or personnel or to public property, loans, grants, 
benefits, or contracts.
    \2\ 5 U.S.C 553(b). Further, Section 553(d) of the 
Administrative Procedure Act, 5 U.S.C. 553(d) provides, in part, for 
publication of a rule not less than 30 days before its effective 
date except as otherwise provided by the agency for good cause found 
and published with the rule.
    \3\ Good cause exists as the final rule implements changes that 
affect internal agency management, organization and procedure that 
do not require a delayed effective date.
---------------------------------------------------------------------------

B. Regulatory Flexibility Act

    The Regulatory Flexibility Act requires the Commission to consider 
whether the regulations it adopts will have a significant economic 
impact on a substantial number of small entities.\4\ The Commission is 
obligated to conduct a regulatory flexibility analysis for any rule for 
which the agency publishes a general notice of proposed rulemaking 
pursuant to Section 553(b) of the Administrative Procedure Act or any 
other law.\5\ This rulemaking is excepted from the public rulemaking 
provisions of the Administrative Procedure Act.\6\ Accordingly, the 
Commission is not required to conduct a regulatory flexibility analysis 
for this rulemaking.
---------------------------------------------------------------------------

    \4\ See 5 U.S.C. 601 et seq.
    \5\ 5 U.S.C. 601(2).
    \6\ See supra notes 1 and 2.
---------------------------------------------------------------------------

C. Paperwork Reduction Act

    The Commission may not conduct or sponsor, and a respondent is not 
required to respond to, a collection of information contained in a 
rulemaking unless the information collection displays a currently valid 
control number issued by the Office of Management and Budget (OMB) 
pursuant to the Paperwork Reduction Act of 1995 (Paperwork Reduction 
Act).\7\ This final rule does not contain a ``collection of 
information'' as defined in the Paperwork Reduction Act \8\ and, 
therefore, is not subject to the requirements of the Paperwork 
Reduction Act.
---------------------------------------------------------------------------

    \7\ See 44 U.S.C. 3501 et seq.
    \8\ ``Collection of information'' is defined in 44 U.S.C. 
3502(3) and 5 CFR 1320.3(c) and includes Agency requests or 
requirements that members of the public submit reports, keep 
records, or provide information to a third party.
---------------------------------------------------------------------------

D. Cost-Benefit Considerations

    Section 15(a) of the Commodity Exchange Act provides that, before 
promulgating a regulation under this Act or issuing an order, the 
Commission shall consider the costs and benefits of the action of the 
Commission.\9\ These rules govern internal agency organization, 
procedure, and practice, and therefore the Commission finds that none 
of the considerations enumerated in Section 15(a)(2) of the Commodity 
Exchange Act are applicable to these rules.\10\
---------------------------------------------------------------------------

    \9\ 7 U.S.C. 19(a).
    \10\ Section 15(a)(2) of the Commodity Exchange Act, 7 U.S.C. 
19(a)(2), specifies that such costs and benefits shall be evaluated 
in light of five broad areas of market and public concern: 
Protection of market participants and the public; efficiency, 
competitiveness, and financial integrity of futures markets; price 
discovery; sound risk management practices; and other public 
interest considerations.
---------------------------------------------------------------------------

E. Congressional Review Act

    This final rule is not a rule as defined in the Congressional 
Review Act.\11\
---------------------------------------------------------------------------

    \11\ See 5 U.S.C. 801-808.
