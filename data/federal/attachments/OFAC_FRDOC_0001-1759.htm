Background

    On March 5, 2020, OFAC issued GLs 1 and 2 to authorize certain 
transactions otherwise prohibited by the Nicaragua Sanctions 
Regulations, 31 CFR part 582 (NSR). On March 25, 2020, OFAC issued GL 
2A, which superseded GL 2, pursuant to the NSR and the Nicaragua 
Investment Conditionality Act of 2018 (50 U.S.C. 1701 note) (NICA Act), 
previously known as the ``Nicaragua Human Rights and Anticorruption Act 
of 2018.'' GL 2A expired on May 6, 2020. Also on March 25, 2020, OFAC 
issued GL 1A pursuant to the NSR and the NICA Act; GL 1A superseded GL 
1 and was later incorporated into the NSR (85 FR 43436). Each GL was 
made available on OFAC's website (<a href="https://ofac.treasury.gov">https://ofac.treasury.gov</a>) when it 
was issued. The text of GLs 1, 2, and 2A is provided below.
