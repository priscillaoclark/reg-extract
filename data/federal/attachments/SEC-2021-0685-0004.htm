SECURITIES AND EXCHANGE COMMISSION

[SEC File No. 270-663, OMB Control No. 3235-0724]


Submission for OMB Review; Comment Request; Extension: Supplier 
Diversity Business Management System

Upon Written Request Copies Available From: U.S. Securities and 
Exchange Commission, Office of FOIA Services, 100 F Street NE, 
Washington, DC 20549-2736

    Notice is hereby given that, pursuant to the Paperwork Reduction 
Act of 1995 (44 U.S.C. 3501 et seq.), the Securities and Exchange 
Commission (``Commission'') has submitted to the Office of Management 
and Budget (``OMB'') a request for extension of the previously approved 
collection of information discussed below.
    The Commission is required under section 342 of the Dodd-Frank Wall 
Street and Reform Act to develop standards and processes for ensuring 
the fair inclusion of women-owned and minority-owned businesses in all 
of the Commission's business activities. In addition, the Commission is 
required to develop standards for coordinating technical assistance to 
minority-owned and women-owned businesses. 12 U.S.C. 5452(b)(2)(B). To 
help implement these requirements, the Office of Minority and Women 
Inclusion (OMWI) developed and maintains an electronic Supplier 
Diversity Business Management System (SDBMS) to collect up-to-date 
business information and capabilities statements from diverse suppliers 
interested in doing business with the Commission. The information 
collected in SDBMS assists the Commission with its market research 
efforts, enables the Commission to assess the effectiveness of its 
technical assistance and outreach efforts and identify target areas for 
additional program efforts, and facilitates the Commission's compliance 
with its Congressionally-mandated reporting obligations on the 
Commission's contract awards.
    The Commission invited comments on SDBMS. Information is collected 
in SDBMS via web-based, e-filed, dynamic form-based technology. The 
company point of contact completes a profile consisting of basic 
contact data and information on the capabilities of the business. The 
profile includes a series of questions, some of which are based on the 
data that the individual enters. Drop-down lists are included where 
appropriate to increase ease of use.
    The information collection is voluntary. There are no costs 
associated with this collection. SDBMS allows suppliers to self-
register via a secure web portal that is accessible through a hyperlink 
on the Commission's public website.
    Title of Collection: Supplier Diversity Management System.
    Type of Review: Request for extension of previously approved 
collection of information.
    Estimated Number of Annual Responses: 300.
    Estimated Annual Reporting Burden: 150 hours (30 minutes per 
submission).
    On February 1, 2024, the Commission published a notice in the 
Federal Register (89 FR 6558) of its intention to request an extension 
of this currently approved collection of information and allowed the 
public 60 days to submit comments. The Commission received no comments.
    Written comments continue to be invited on: (a) whether this 
collection of information is necessary for the proper performance of 
the functions of the agency, including whether the information will 
have practical utility; (b) the accuracy of the agency's estimate of 
the burden imposed by the collection of information; (c) ways to 
enhance the quality, utility, and clarity of the information collected; 
and (d) ways to minimize the burden of the collection of information on 
respondents, including through the use of automated collection

techniques or other forms of information technology.
    An agency may not conduct or sponsor, and a person is not required 
to respond to, a collection of information under the PRA unless it 
displays a currently valid OMB control number.
