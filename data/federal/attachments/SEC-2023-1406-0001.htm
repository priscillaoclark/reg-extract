    Pursuant to Section 19(b)(1) \1\ of the Securities Exchange Act of 
1934 (``Act'' or ``Exchange Act'') \2\ and Rule 19b-4 thereunder,\3\ 
notice is hereby given that on November 20, 2023, NYSE American LLC 
(``Exchange'') filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission 
(``Commission'') the proposed rule change as described in Items I and

organization. The Commission is publishing this notice to solicit 
comments on the proposed rule change from interested persons.

---------------------------------------------------------------------------

I. Self-Regulatory Organization's Statement of the Terms of Substance 
of the Proposed Rule Change

    The Exchange proposes to update citations to Rule 600(b) of 
Regulation National Market System (``Regulation NMS'') in Rule 7.31E 
(Orders and Modifiers); Rule 5320--Equities (Prohibition Against 
Trading Ahead of Customer Orders); Rule 6140--Equities (Other Trading 
Practices); Rule 6810 (Consolidated Audit Trail--Definitions); and Rule 
7410--Equities (Definitions). The proposed rule change is available on 
the Exchange's website at <a href="http://www.nyse.com">www.nyse.com</a>, at the principal office of the 
Exchange, and at the Commission's Public Reference Room.

II. Self-Regulatory Organization's Statement of the Purpose of, and 
Statutory Basis for, the Proposed Rule Change

    In its filing with the Commission, the self-regulatory organization 
included statements concerning the purpose of, and basis for, the 
proposed rule change and discussed any comments it received on the 
proposed rule change. The text of those statements may be examined at 
the places specified in Item IV below. The Exchange has prepared 
summaries, set forth in sections A, B, and C below, of the most 
significant parts of such statements.

A. Self-Regulatory Organization's Statement of the Purpose of, and the 
Statutory Basis for, the Proposed Rule Change

1. Purpose
    The Exchange proposes to update citations to Rule 600(b) of 
Regulation NMS in Rule 7.31E (Orders and Modifiers); Rule 5320--
Equities (Prohibition Against Trading Ahead of Customer Orders); Rule 
6140--Equities (Other Trading Practices); Rule 6810 (Consolidated Audit 
Trail--Definitions); and Rule 7410--Equities (Definitions).
    In 2021, the Securities and Exchange Commission (the 
``Commission'') amended Regulation NMS under the Act in connection with 
the adoption of the Market Data Infrastructure Rules.\4\ As part of 
that initiative, the Commission adopted new definitions in Rule 600(b) 
of Regulation NMS and renumbered the remaining definitions, including 
the definition of Intermarket Sweep Order (formerly Rule 600(b)(30)), 
Listed Option (formerly Rule 600(b)(35)), and NMS Stock (formerly Rule 
600(b)(47)).
---------------------------------------------------------------------------

    \4\ See Securities Exchange Act Release No. 90610, 86 FR 18596 
(April 9, 2021) (S7-03-20).
---------------------------------------------------------------------------

    The Exchange accordingly proposes to update the relevant citations 
to Rule 600(b) in its rules as follows.
    <bullet> The citation to the definition of Intermarket Sweep Order 
in Rule 7.31E(e)(3), Rule 5320--Equities, Supplementary Material .04, 
and Rule 7410(h) would be changed to Rule 600(b)(38).
    <bullet> The citation to the definition of NMS Stock in Rule 6140--
Equities(a) and Rule 6810(qq) would be changed to Rule 600(b)(55).
    <bullet> The citation to the definition of Listed Option in Rule 
6810(y) would be changed to Rule 600(b)(43).
2. Statutory Basis
    The Exchange believes that the proposed rule change is consistent 
with

[[Page 84868]]

Section 6(b)(5) of the Exchange Act,\5\ in that it is designed to 
prevent fraudulent and manipulative acts and practices, to promote just 
and equitable principles of trade, to foster cooperation and 
coordination with persons engaged in facilitating transactions in 
securities, to remove impediments to and perfect the mechanism of a 
free and open market and a national market system and, in general, to 
protect investors and the public interest.
---------------------------------------------------------------------------

    \5\ 15 U.S.C. 78f(b)(5).
---------------------------------------------------------------------------

    The Exchange believes that the proposed changes to its rules to 
correct citations to Rule 600(b) of Regulation NMS would remove 
impediments to and perfect the mechanism of a free and open market and 
a national market system because the proposed change is designed to 
update an external rule reference. The Exchange believes that member 
organizations would benefit from the increased clarity, thereby 
reducing potential confusion and ensuring that persons subject to the 
Exchange's jurisdiction, regulators, and the investing public can more 
easily navigate and understand the Exchange's rules. The Exchange 
further believes that the proposed amendment would not be inconsistent 
with the public interest and the protection of investors because 
investors will not be harmed and in fact would benefit from increased 
clarity, thereby reducing potential confusion.

B. Self-Regulatory Organization's Statement on Burden on Competition

    In accordance with Section 6(b)(8) of the Act,\6\ the Exchange 
believes that the proposed rule change would not impose any burden on 
competition that is not necessary or appropriate in furtherance of the 
purposes of the Act. The proposed rule change is not intended to 
address competitive issues but rather would modify Exchange rules to 
update citations to Rule 600(b) of Reg NMS. Since the proposal does not 
substantively modify system functionality or processes on the Exchange, 
the proposed changes will not impose any burden on competition.
---------------------------------------------------------------------------

    \6\ 15 U.S.C. 78f(b)(8).
---------------------------------------------------------------------------

C. Self-Regulatory Organization's Statement on Comments on the Proposed 
Rule Change Received From Members, Participants, or Others

    No written comments were solicited or received with respect to the 
proposed rule change.

III. Date of Effectiveness of the Proposed Rule Change and Timing for 
Commission Action

    Pursuant to Section 19(b)(3)(A) of the Act \7\ and Rule 19b-4(f)(6) 
\8\ thereunder, the Exchange has designated this proposal as one that 
effects a change that: (i) does not significantly affect the protection 
of investors or the public interest; (ii) does not impose any 
significant burden on competition; and (iii) by its terms, does not 
become operative for 30 days after the date of the filing, or such 
shorter time as the Commission may designate if consistent with the 
protection of investors and the public interest.\9\
---------------------------------------------------------------------------

    \7\ 15 U.S.C. 78s(b)(3)(A).
    \8\ 17 CFR 240.19b-4(f)(6).
    \9\ In addition, Rule 19b-4(f)(6) requires a self-regulatory 
organization to give the Commission written notice of its intent to 
file the proposed rule change at least five business days prior to 
the date of filing of the proposed rule change, or such shorter time 
as designated by the Commission. The Exchange has satisfied this 
requirement.
---------------------------------------------------------------------------

    A proposed rule change filed pursuant to Rule 19b-4(f)(6) under the 
Act normally does not become operative for 30 days after the date of 
its filing. However, Rule 19b-4(f)(6)(iii) \10\ permits the Commission 
to designate a shorter time if such action is consistent with the 
protection of investors and the public interest. The Exchange requested 
that the Commission waive the 30-day operative delay so that the 
proposal may become operative immediately upon filing. The proposed 
change raises no novel legal or regulatory issues and modifies the 
Exchange's rules to correct citations to Rule 600(b) of Regulation NMS, 
which should help prevent confusion and result in increased clarity 
within the Exchange's rules. Therefore, the Commission believes that 
waiver of the 30-day operative delay is consistent with the protection 
of investors and the public interest. Accordingly, the Commission 
hereby waives the 30-day operative delay and designates the proposed 
rule change operative upon filing.\11\
---------------------------------------------------------------------------

    \10\ 17 CFR 240.19b-4(f)(6)(iii).
    \11\ For purposes only of waiving the 30-day operative delay, 
the Commission has also considered the proposed rule's impact on 
efficiency, competition, and capital formation. See 15 U.S.C. 
78c(f).
---------------------------------------------------------------------------

    At any time within 60 days of the filing of the proposed rule 
change, the Commission summarily may temporarily suspend such rule 
change if it appears to the Commission that such action is necessary or 
appropriate in the public interest, for the protection of investors, or 
otherwise in furtherance of the purposes of the Act.
