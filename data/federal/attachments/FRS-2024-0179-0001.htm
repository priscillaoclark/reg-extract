    As background, the International Association of Insurance 
Supervisors (IAIS) is developing the Insurance Capital Standard (ICS) 
as a consolidated group-wide capital standard for internationally 
active insurance groups, for the purposes of creating a common language 
for supervisory discussions of group solvency and enhancing global 
convergence among group capital standards.\3\ The IAIS also is 
assessing whether the Aggregation Method under development by the 
United States provides comparable outcomes to the ICS, and if so, will 
be considered an outcome-equivalent approach for implementation of the 
ICS as a prescribed capital requirement.\4\
