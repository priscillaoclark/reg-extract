SECURITIES AND EXCHANGE COMMISSION

[SEC File No. 270-346, OMB Control No. 3235-0392]


Proposed Collection; Comment Request; Extension: Rule 15g-3

Upon Written Request, Copies Available From: Securities and Exchange 
Commission, Office of FOIA Services, 100 F Street NE, Washington, DC 
20549-2736

    Notice is hereby given that pursuant to the Paperwork Reduction Act 
of 1995 (``PRA'') (44 U.S.C. 3501 et seq.), the Securities and Exchange 
Commission (``Commission'') is soliciting comments on the existing 
collection of information provided for in Rule 15g-3--Broker or dealer 
disclosure of quotations and other information relating to the penny 
stock market (17 CFR 240.15g-3) under the Securities Exchange Act of 
1934 (15 U.S.C. 78a et seq.). The Commission plans to submit this 
existing collection of information to the Office of Management and 
Budget (``OMB'') for extension and approval.
    Rule 15g-3 requires that brokers and dealers disclose to customers 
current quotation prices or similar market information in connection 
with transactions in penny stocks. The purpose of the rule is to 
increase the level of disclosure to investors concerning penny stocks 
generally and specific penny stock transactions.
    The Commission estimates that approximately 170 broker-dealers will 
each spend an average of approximately 87.0833333 hours annually to 
comply with this rule. Thus, the total time burden is approximately 
14,804 hours per year.
    Written comments are invited on: (a) whether the proposed 
collection of information is necessary for the proper performance of 
the functions of the Commission, including whether the information 
shall have practical utility; (b) the accuracy of the Commission's 
estimates of the burden of the proposed collection of information; (c) 
ways to enhance the quality, utility, and clarity of the information 
collected; and (d) ways to minimize the burden of the collection of 
information on respondents, including through the use of automated 
collection techniques or other forms of information technology. 
Consideration will be given to comments and suggestions submitted by 
July 19, 2024.
    An agency may not conduct or sponsor, and a person is not required 
to respond to, a collection of information under the PRA unless it 
displays a currently valid OMB control number.
    Please direct your written comments to: David Bottom, Director/
Chief Information Officer, Securities and Exchange Commission, c/o John 
Pezzullo, 100 F Street NE, Washington, DC 20549, or send an email to:

    Dated: May 15, 2024.
Sherry R. Haywood,
Assistant Secretary.
