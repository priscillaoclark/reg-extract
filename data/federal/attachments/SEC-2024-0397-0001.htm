SECURITIES AND EXCHANGE COMMISSION

[Release No. 6576/March 18, 2024]


Notice of Intention To Cancel Registration Pursuant to Section 
203(h) of the Investment Advisers Act of 1940

    Notice is given that the Securities and Exchange Commission (the 
``Commission'') intends to issue an order, pursuant to Section 203(h) 
of the Investment Advisers Act of 1940 (the ``Act''), cancelling the 
registration of Hennii Investment Advisory Services, Inc., File No. 
801-120518, hereinafter referred to as the ``registrant.''
    Section 203(h) provides, in pertinent part, that if the Commission 
finds that any person registered under section 203, or who has pending 
an application for registration filed under that section, is no longer 
in existence, is not engaged in business as an investment adviser, or 
is prohibited from registering as an investment adviser under section 
203A, the Commission shall by order, cancel the registration of such 
person.
    The registrant, since March of 2021, has not filed a Form ADV 
amendment with the Commission as required by rule 204-1 under the Act 
and appears to be no longer in business as an investment adviser or is 
otherwise not engaged in business as an investment adviser.\1\ 
Accordingly, the Commission believes that reasonable grounds exist for 
a finding that this registrant is no longer in existence and is no 
longer eligible to be registered with the Commission as an investment 
adviser and that the registration should be cancelled pursuant to 
section 203(h) of the Act.
---------------------------------------------------------------------------

    \1\ Rule 204-1 under the Act requires any adviser that is 
required to complete Form ADV to amend the form at least annually 
and to submit the amendments electronically through the Investment 
Adviser Registration Depository.
---------------------------------------------------------------------------

    Notice is also given that any interested person may, by April 12, 
2024, at 5:30 p.m., submit to the Commission in writing a request for a 
hearing on the cancellation, accompanied by a statement as to the 
nature of his or her interest, the reason for such request, and the 
issues, if any, of fact or law proposed to be controverted, and he or 
she may request that he or she be notified if the Commission should 
order a hearing thereon. Any such communication should be emailed to 
the Commission's Secretary at <a href="/cdn-cgi/l/email-protection#a4f7c1c7d6c1d0c5d6ddd789ebc2c2cdc7c1e4d7c1c78ac3cbd2"><span class="__cf_email__" data-cfemail="7526101607100114070c06583a13131c1610350610165b121a03">[email&#160;protected]</span></a>.
    At any time after April 12, 2024, the Commission may issue an order 
cancelling the registration, upon the basis of the information stated 
above, unless an order for a hearing on the cancellation shall be 
issued upon request or upon the Commission's own motion. Persons who 
requested a hearing, or who requested to be advised as to whether a 
hearing is ordered, will receive any notices and orders issued in this 
matter, including the date of the hearing (if ordered) and any 
postponements thereof. Any adviser whose registration is cancelled 
under delegated authority may appeal that decision directly to the 
Commission in accordance with rules 430 and 431 of the Commission's 
rules of practice (17 CFR 201.430 and 431).
