Background

    The Iranian Transactions Regulations, 31 CFR part 560 (the 
``ITR''), implement a series of Executive Orders that began with 
Executive Order 12613 of October 29, 1987, issued pursuant to 
authorities including the International Security and Development 
Cooperation Act of 1985 (22 U.S.C. 2349aa-9). In that original order, 
after finding, inter alia, that the Government of Iran was actively 
supporting terrorism as an instrument of state policy, the President 
prohibited the importation of Iranian-origin goods and services. 
Subsequently, in Executive Order 12957, issued on March 15, 1995, under 
the authority of, inter alia, the International Emergency Economic 
Powers Act (50 U.S.C. 1701-1706) (``IEEPA''), the President declared a 
national emergency with respect to the actions and policies of the 
Government of Iran, including its support for international terrorism, 
its efforts to undermine the Middle East peace process, and its efforts 
to acquire weapons of mass destruction and the means to deliver them. 
To deal with that threat, Executive Order 12957 imposed prohibitions on 
certain transactions with respect to the development of Iranian 
petroleum resources. On May 6, 1995, to further respond to this threat, 
the President issued Executive Order 12959, which imposed comprehensive 
trade and financial sanctions on Iran. Finally, on August 19, 1997, the 
President issued Executive Order 13059 consolidating and clarifying the 
previous orders.
    Existing Sec.  560.320 of the ITR defines the term Iranian accounts 
to mean accounts of persons located in Iran or of the Government of 
Iran maintained on the books of either a United States depository 
institution or a United States registered broker or dealer in 
securities. OFAC is revising Sec.  560.320 to clarify the definition by 
substituting the new phrase ``persons who are ordinarily resident in 
Iran, except when such persons are not located in Iran'' for the phrase 
``persons located in Iran.'' This change will improve OFAC's overall 
administration of the ITR and facilitate compliance by U.S. financial 
institutions. As revised, Sec.  560.320 defines Iranian accounts to 
mean accounts of persons who are ordinarily resident in Iran, except 
when such persons are not located in Iran, or of the Government of Iran 
maintained on the books of either a United States depository 
institution or a United States registered broker or dealer in 
securities.

[[Page 36398]]

    In addition to revising the definition in Sec.  560.320, OFAC is 
making certain conforming changes to Sec.  560.517 and Sec. Sec.  
560.532-560.535. These sections use language from the unamended 
definition of the term Iranian accounts in describing certain 
transactions that are authorized or prohibited with respect to such 
accounts. Therefore, OFAC is revising these sections by deleting that 
language and instead relying on a reference to the definition in Sec.  
560.320. Lastly, OFAC also is making a technical correction to the 
heading of Sec.  560.532.

Public Participation

    Because the amendments of the ITR involve a foreign affairs 
function, Executive Order 12866 and the provisions of the 
Administrative Procedure Act (5 U.S.C. 553) requiring notice of 
proposed rulemaking, opportunity for public participation, and delay in 
effective date are inapplicable. Because no notice of proposed 
rulemaking is required for this rule, the Regulatory Flexibility Act (5 
U.S.C. 601-612) does not apply.

Paperwork Reduction Act

    The collections of information related to the ITR are contained in 
31 CFR part 501 (the ``Reporting, Procedures and Penalties 
Regulations''). Pursuant to the Paperwork Reduction Act of 1995 (44 
U.S.C. 3507), those collections of information have been approved by 
the Office of Management and Budget under control number 1505-0164. An 
agency may not conduct or sponsor, and a person is not required to 
respond to, a collection of information unless the collection of 
information displays a valid control number.
