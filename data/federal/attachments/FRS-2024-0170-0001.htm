    OMB control number: 7100-0373.
    General description of collection: Section 13(3) of the Federal 
Reserve Act provides that the Board may authorize any Federal Reserve 
Bank to extend credit to an individual, partnership, or corporation, 
subject to conditions. The Board's Regulation A establishes policies 
and procedures with respect to emergency lending under section 13(3).

compliance with the terms and conditions of the emergency lending

the Federal Register (89 FR 16570) requesting public comment for 60 
days on the extension, with revision, of the FR A. The Board revised 
the FR A by removing certain reporting and disclosure requirements that 
were specific to COVID-19 era lending facility programs established in 
2020, which have since ceased operation. The comment period for this 
notice expired on May 6, 2024. The Board did not receive any comments. 
The revisions will be implemented as proposed.
