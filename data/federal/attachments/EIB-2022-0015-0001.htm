EXPORT-IMPORT BANK

Agency Information Collection Activities: Comment Request

AGENCY: Export-Import Bank.

ACTION: Submission for OMB review and comments request.

SUMMARY: The Export-Import Bank of the United States (EXIM), as part of 
its continuing effort to reduce paperwork and respondent burden, 
invites the general public and other Federal Agencies to comment on the 
proposed information collection, as required by the paperwork Reduction 
Act of 1995.
    EXIM enables U.S. exporters to compete fairly in foreign markets on 
the basis of price and product by neutralizing the effect of export 
credit insurance and guarantees offered by foreign governments and by 
absorbing credit risks that the private section will not accept. This 
collection of information is necessary to determine eligibility of the 
applicant for EXIM support.

DATES: Comments should be received on or before September 7, 2022 to be 
assured of consideration.

ADDRESSES: Comments may be submitted electronically on 
WWW.REGULATIONS.GOV (EIB 95-10) or by mail to Office of Information and 
Regulatory Affairs, 725 17th Street NW, Washington, DC 20038, Attn: OMB 
3048-0013. The application can be viewed at <a href="http://www.exim.gov/sites/default/files/pub/pending/eib95-10all.pdf">http://www.exim.gov/sites/default/files/pub/pending/eib95-10all.pdf</a>.
