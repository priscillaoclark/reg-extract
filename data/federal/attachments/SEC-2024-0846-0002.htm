SECURITIES AND EXCHANGE COMMISSION

[SEC File No. 270-110, OMB Control No. 3235-0286]


Submission for OMB Review; Comment Request; Extension: Regulation 
A (Form 1-A): Small Issuer Exemption From Registration Under the 
Securities Act and Its Attendant Form

Upon Written Request Copies Available From: Securities and Exchange 
Commission, Office of FOIA Services, 100 F Street NE, Washington, DC 
20549-2736.

    Notice is hereby given that, pursuant to the Paperwork Reduction 
Act of 1995 (44 U.S.C. 3501 et seq.), the Securities and Exchange 
Commission (``Commission'') has submitted to the Office of Management 
and Budget this request for extension of the previously approved 
collection of information discussed below.
    Regulation A (17 CFR 230.251 through 230.263) provides an exemption 
from registration under the Securities Act of 1933 (15 U.S.C. 77a et 
seq.) for certain limited offerings of securities by issuers who do not 
otherwise file reports with the Commission. Form 1-A is an offering 
statement filed under Regulation A. The paperwork burden from 
Regulation A is imposed through the forms that are subject to the 
disclosure requirements in Regulation A and is reflected in the 
analysis of the form. To avoid a Paperwork Reduction Act inventory 
reflecting duplicative burdens, for administrative convenience we 
estimate the burden imposed by Regulation A to be a total of one hour. 
We estimate that approximately 325 issuers file Forms 1-A. We estimate 
that Form 1-A takes approximately 717.372 hours to prepare. We estimate 
that 75% of the 717.372 hours per response (538.029 hours) is prepared 
by the company for a total annual burden of 174,859 hours (538.029 
hours per response x 325 responses).
    An agency may not conduct or sponsor, and a person is not required 
to respond to, a collection of information unless it displays a 
currently valid control number.
    The public may view background documentation for this information 
collection at the following website: <a href="http://www.reginfo.gov">www.reginfo.gov</a>. Find this 
particular information collection by selecting ``Currently under 30-day 
Review--Open for Public Comments'' or by using the search function. 
Written comments and recommendations for the proposed information 
collection should be sent within 30 days of publication of this notice 
by October 15, 2024 to (i) <a href="http://www.reginfo.gov/public/do/PRAMain">www.reginfo.gov/public/do/PRAMain</a> and (ii)

Commission, c/o Oluwaseun Ajayi, 100 F Street NE, Washington, DC 20549,

    Dated: September 10, 2024.
Vanessa A. Countryman,
Secretary.
