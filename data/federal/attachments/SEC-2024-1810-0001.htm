SECURITIES AND EXCHANGE COMMISSION

[SEC File No. 270-566, OMB Control No. 3235-0627]


Proposed Collection; Comment Request; Extension: Rule 17g-4

Upon Written Request, Copies Available From: Securities and Exchange 
Commission, Office of FOIA Services, 100 F Street NE, Washington, DC 
20549-2736

    Notice is hereby given that pursuant to the Paperwork Reduction Act 
of 1995 (44 U.S.C. 3501 et seq.), the Securities and Exchange 
Commission (``Commission'') is soliciting comments on the existing 
collection of information provided for in Rule 17g-4 (17 CFR 240.17g-4) 
under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 (15 U.S.C. 78a et seq.) 
(``Exchange Act''). The Commission plans to submit this existing 
collection of information to the Office of Management and Budget for 
extension and approval.
    Rule 17g-4 contains collection of information requirements.\1\ 
Specifically, Rule 17g-4 requires each nationally recognized 
statistical rating organization (``NRSRO'') to establish, maintain, and 
enforce written policies and procedures that are reasonably designed to 
prevent the following: (1) the inappropriate dissemination of material 
nonpublic information obtained in connection with the performance of 
credit rating services; (2) a person within the NRSRO from trading or 
otherwise benefiting on material nonpublic information; and (3) the 
inappropriate dissemination of a pending credit rating action.
---------------------------------------------------------------------------

    \1\ See 17 CFR 240.17g-4.
---------------------------------------------------------------------------

    Currently, there are 10 credit rating agencies registered as NRSROs 
with the Commission. Based on staff experience, an NRSRO is estimated 
to spend an average of approximately 10 hours per year reviewing 
policies and procedures required by Rule 17g-4, updating the policies 
and procedures (if necessary), and enforcing them, for a total 
industry-wide annual hour burden of approximately 100 hours.\2\
---------------------------------------------------------------------------

    \2\ 10 hours x 10 NRSROs = 100 hours.
---------------------------------------------------------------------------

    Written comments are invited on: (a) whether the proposed 
collection of information is necessary for the proper performance of 
the functions of the Commission, including whether the information 
shall have practical utility; (b) the accuracy of the Commission's 
estimates of the burden of the proposed collection of information; (c) 
ways to enhance the quality, utility, and clarity of the information on 
respondents; and (d) ways to minimize the burden of the collection of 
information on respondents, including through the use of automated 
collection techniques or other forms of information technology. 
Consideration will be given to comments and suggestions submitted by 
February 11, 2025.
    An agency may not conduct or sponsor, and a person is not required 
to respond to, a collection of information unless it displays a 
currently valid OMB control number. Please direct your written comments 
to: Austin Gerig, Director/Chief Data Officer, Securities and Exchange 
Commission, c/o Tanya Ruttenberg, 100 F St NE, Washington, DC 20549 or 
send an email to: <a href="/cdn-cgi/l/email-protection#0c5c5e4d53416d65606e63744c7f696f226b637a"><span class="__cf_email__" data-cfemail="67373526382a060e0b05081f2714020449000811">[email&#160;protected]</span></a>.

    Dated: December 9, 2024.
Sherry R. Haywood,
Assistant Secretary.
