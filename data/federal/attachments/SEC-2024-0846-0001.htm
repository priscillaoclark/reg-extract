SECURITIES AND EXCHANGE COMMISSION

[SEC File No. 270-110, OMB Control No. 3235-0286]


Proposed Collection; Comment Request; Extension: Regulation A 
(Form 1-A): Small Issuer Exemption From Registration Under the 
Securities Act and Its Attendant Form

Upon Written Request Copies Available From: Securities and Exchange 
Commission, Office of FOIA Services, 100 F Street NE, Washington, DC 
20549-2736

    Notice is hereby given that, pursuant to the Paperwork Reduction 
Act of 1995 (44 U.S.C. 3501 et seq.), the Securities and Exchange 
Commission (``Commission'') is soliciting comments on the collection of 
information summarized below. The Commission plans to submit this 
existing collection of information to the Office of Management and 
Budget for extension and approval.
    Regulation A (17 CFR 230.251 through 230.263) provides an exemption 
from registration under the Securities Act of 1933 (15 U.S.C. 77a et 
seq.) for certain limited offerings of securities by issuers who do not 
otherwise file reports with the Commission. Form 1-A is an offering 
statement filed under Regulation A. The paperwork burden from 
Regulation A is imposed through the forms that are subject to the 
disclosure requirements in Regulation A and is reflected in the 
analysis of the form. To avoid a Paperwork Reduction Act inventory 
reflecting duplicative burdens, for administrative convenience we 
estimate the burden imposed by Regulation A to be a total of one hour. 
We estimate that approximately 325 issuers file Forms 1-A. We estimate 
that Form 1-A takes approximately 717.372 hours to prepare. We estimate 
that 75% of the 717.372 hours per response (538.029 hours) is prepared 
by the company for a total annual burden of 174,859 hours (538.029 
hours per response x 325 responses).
    Written comments are invited on: (a) whether this proposed 
collection of information is necessary for the proper performance of 
the functions of the agency, including whether the information will 
have practical utility; (b) the accuracy of the agency's estimate of 
the burden imposed by the collection of information; (c) ways to 
enhance the quality, utility, and clarity of the information collected; 
and (d) ways to minimize the burden of the collection of information on 
respondents, including through the use of automated collection

techniques or other forms of information technology. Consideration will 
be given to comments and suggestions submitted in writing within 60 
days of this publication by August 26, 2024.
    An agency may not conduct or sponsor, and a person is not required 
to respond to, a collection of information unless it displays a 
currently valid control number.
    Please direct your written comment to David Bottom, Director/Chief 
Information Officer, Securities and Exchange Commission, c/o John 
Pezzullo, 100 F Street NE, Washington, DC 20549 or send an email to:

Secretary.
