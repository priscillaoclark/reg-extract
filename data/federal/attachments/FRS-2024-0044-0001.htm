will consider all comments received from the public and other agencies.
    During the comment period for this proposal, a copy of the proposed 
PRA OMB submission, including the draft reporting form and 
instructions, supporting statement (which contains more detail about 
the information collection and burden estimates than this notice), and 
other documentation, will be made available on the Board's public

Request for Comment on Information Collection Proposal

    The Board invites public comment on the following information 
collection, which is being reviewed under authority delegated by the 
OMB under the PRA. Comments are invited on the following:
    a. Whether the proposed collection of information is necessary for 
the proper performance of the Board's functions, including whether the 
information has practical utility;
    b. The accuracy of the Board's estimate of the burden of the 
proposed information collection, including the validity of the 
methodology and assumptions used;
    c. Ways to enhance the quality, utility, and clarity of the 
information to be collected;
    d. Ways to minimize the burden of information collection on 
respondents, including through the use of automated collection 
techniques or other forms of information technology; and

maintenance, and purchase of services to provide information.
    At the end of the comment period, the comments and recommendations 
received will be analyzed to determine the extent to which the Board

Proposal Under OMB Delegated Authority To Extend for Three Years, With 
Revision, the Following Information Collection

    Collection title: Margin Credit Reports.
    Collection identifier: FR G-1, FR G-2, FR G-3, FR G-4, FR T-4, and 
FR U-1.
    OMB control number: 7100-0011.
    General description of collection: The Margin Credit Reports is 
comprised of the following six reports: Registration Statement for 
Persons Who Extend Credit Secured by Margin Stock (Other Than Banks, 
Brokers, or Dealers) (FR G-1), Deregistration Statement for Persons 
Registered Pursuant to Regulation U (FR G-2), Statement of Purpose for 
an Extension of Credit Secured by Margin Stock by a Person Subject to 
Registration Under Regulation U (FR G-3), Annual Report (FR G-4), 
Statement of Purpose for an Extension of Credit by a Creditor (FR T-4), 
and Statement of Purpose for an Extension of Credit Secured by Margin 
Stock (FR U-1). These reports relate to extensions of credit secured by 
margin stock. The Board collects the information gathered by the Margin 
Credit Reports so that it may meet certain obligations under the 
Securities Exchange Act of 1934.
    Certain lenders that are not brokers, dealers, or banks making 
loans secured by margin stock must register and deregister with the 
Federal Reserve using the FR G-1 and FR G-2, respectively, and must 
file an annual report (FR G-4) while registered. The FR G-1, FR G-2, 
and FR G-4 reporting requirements collect data used to identify lenders 
subject to the Board's Regulation U to verify their compliance

[[Page 12343]]

with the regulation and to monitor margin credit.
    The FR T-4, FR U-1, and FR G-3 are forms that implement 
recordkeeping requirements for brokers and dealers, banks, and other 
lenders, respectively. The FR T-4 documents the purpose of credit being 
extended when that credit is not to purchase, carry, or trade in 
securities and the credit is in excess of that otherwise permitted 
under Regulation T. The FR G-3 and FR U-1 document the purpose of loans 
secured by margin stock.
    Proposed revisions: The Board proposes to revise the FR G-1 and FR 
G-4 by updating the confidentiality treatment as contained in the 
reporting instructions to state that individual respondents may request 
that information submitted to the Board through the FR G-1 and FR G-4 
be kept confidential and the Board will evaluate whether such treatment 
is appropriate on a case-by-case basis. The reports currently state 
that the Board considers the information submitted to be confidential. 
The Board believes these changes more accurately reflect its 
obligations under the Privacy Act of 1974, 5 U.S.C. 552a. There are no 
changes being proposed to the FR G-2, FR G-3, FR T-4, or FR U-1.
    Frequency: Event-generated.
    Respondents: The FR G-1, FR G-2, FR G-3, and FR G-4 panels comprise 
lenders, other than banks, brokers, or dealers, that extend margin 
credit, including federal and state credit unions; insurance companies; 
commercial and consumer credit organizations; production credit 
associations; small businesses; insurance premium funding plans; plan-
lenders (a company or its affiliate that extends credit to employees to 
purchase company stock under an eligible employee stock option or stock 
purchase plan); and lenders to Employee Stock Ownership Plans (ESOPs), 
thrift plans, and broker-dealer affiliates. The FR T-4 panel comprises 
brokers and dealers and the FR U-1 panel comprises banks.
    Total estimated number of respondents: FR G-1, 25; FR G-2, 12; FR 
G-3, 10; FR G-4, 129; FR T-4, 14; FR U-1, 14.
    Estimated average hours per response: FR G-1, 1.65; FR G-2, 0.53; 
FR G-3, 0.25; FR G-4, 2.07; FR T-4, 0.25; FR U-1, 0.25.
    Total estimated annual burden hours: 697.\1\
