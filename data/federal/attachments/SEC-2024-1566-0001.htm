SECURITIES AND EXCHANGE COMMISSION

[Release No. 34-101468; File No. S7-2024-07]


Notice of an Application of the New York Stock Exchange LLC for 
an Exemption Pursuant to Section 36 of the Securities Exchange Act of 
1934 and Request for Comment

October 29, 2024.
    On April 12, 2024, the Securities and Exchange Commission (the 
``Commission'') received an application from the New York Stock 
Exchange LLC (the ``NYSE'') to amend an exemption granted to the NYSE 
on November 16, 2006 (the ``2006 Exemption'') \1\ pursuant to Section 
36 \2\ of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 (the ``Exchange 
Act''),\3\ in accordance with the procedures set forth in Exchange Act 
Rule 0-12.\4\ The 2006 Exemption granted exemptive relief from Section 
12(a) of the Exchange Act \5\ to permit the NYSE's members, brokers and 
dealers to trade debt securities not registered under the Exchange Act 
on the NYSE's Automated Bond System, now known as ``NYSE Bonds,'' 
subject to certain conditions. One of those conditions is that an 
issuer of the debt securities, or the issuer's parent if the issuer is 
a wholly-owned subsidiary, have at least one class of common or 
preferred equity securities that is (i) registered under Section 12(b) 
of the Exchange Act and (ii) listed on the NYSE.\6\ The NYSE seeks to 
amend the 2006 Exemption by revising the condition that the class of 
listed common or preferred equity securities be listed on the NYSE. The 
NYSE requests that debt securities not registered under the Exchange 
Act be permitted to trade on NYSE Bonds if their issuer, or the 
issuer's parent if the issuer is a wholly-owned subsidiary, has a class 
of common or preferred equity securities listed on any registered 
national securities exchange, not only the NYSE. All other terms of the 
2006 Exemption would remain in effect.\7\ We are publishing this notice 
to provide interested persons with an opportunity to comment.

    \7\ The NYSE's application for exemptive relief is included as 
an Appendix to this release.
---------------------------------------------------------------------------

I. Background

    Section 12(a) of the Exchange Act provides in relevant part that it 
``shall be unlawful for any member, broker or dealer to effect any 
transaction in any security (other than an exempted security) on a 
national securities exchange unless a registration is effective as to 
such security for such exchange.'' Section 12(b) \8\ of the Exchange 
Act dictates how the registration referred to in Section 12(a) must be 
accomplished. Accordingly, all equity and debt securities that are not 
``exempted securities'' \9\ or are not otherwise exempt from Exchange 
Act registration must be registered by the issuer under the Exchange 
Act before a member, broker or dealer may trade that class of 
securities on a national securities exchange.
---------------------------------------------------------------------------

    \8\ 15 U.S.C. 78l(b).
    \9\ An exempted security may be traded on a national securities 
exchange absent Exchange Act registration. Section 3(a)(12) of the 
Exchange Act [15 U.S.C. 78c(a)(12)] defines exempted security to 
include securities such as government securities, municipal 
securities, various trust fund interests, pooled income fund 
interests and church plan interests.

---------------------------------------------------------------------------

[[Page 87669]]

    At the same time, brokers or dealers who trade debt securities 
other than on a national securities exchange may trade debt securities 
regardless of whether the issuer registered that class of debt under 
the Exchange Act. This is the case because, while the Exchange Act 
requires issuers to register certain equity securities that are not 
traded on a national securities exchange, it does not require issuers 
to register debt securities that are not traded on a national 
securities exchange. In particular, Section 12(g) \10\ of the Exchange 
Act, the only Exchange Act provision other than Section 12(a) to impose 
an affirmative Exchange Act registration requirement, requires the 
registration of equity securities only.\11\
---------------------------------------------------------------------------

    \10\ 15 U.S.C. 78l(g).
    \11\ Section 12(g)(1) of the Exchange Act and Rule 12g-1 [17 CFR 
240.12g-1] promulgated thereunder require an issuer to register a 
class of equity securities if the issuer of the securities, at the 
end of its fiscal year, has more than $10,000,000 in total assets 
and a class of equity securities held by either 2,000 persons or 500 
persons who are not accredited investors. When Congress amended the 
Exchange Act in 1964 to add Section 12(g), it extended the 
registration requirement to specified equity securities that are not 
exchange-traded. No comparable provision was provided for debt 
securities that are not exchange-traded.
---------------------------------------------------------------------------

    As the Commission has stated in the past, this disparate regulatory 
treatment between debt securities traded on an exchange versus ``over-
the-counter'' (``OTC'') may have negatively and unnecessarily affected 
the structure and development of the debt markets.\12\ Therefore, the 
Commission has taken steps to mitigate the effects of such disparate 
treatment. For example, in 1994, to reduce existing regulatory 
distinctions between exchange-traded debt securities and debt 
securities that trade in the OTC market, the Commission adopted 
Exchange Act Rule 3a12-11.\13\ Rule 3a12-11 provides for the automatic 
effectiveness of Form 8-A registration statements for exchange-traded 
debt securities, exempts exchange-traded debt from the borrowing 
restrictions under section 8(a) of the Exchange Act,\14\ and exempts 
exchange-traded debt from certain proxy and information statement 
requirements under sections 14(a), (b) and (c) of the Exchange Act.\15\

application for exemptive relief. See also Release Nos. 34-34922

    As another example, in 2002, the Commission approved the Financial 
Industry Regulatory Authority's (``FINRA'') rules for the Transaction 
Reporting and Compliance Engine (``TRACE'') to, among other things, 
improve price transparency in the corporate bond market.\16\ Since 
2002, FINRA has increased transparency in the corporate bond market 
through TRACE by, most recently, reducing the 15-minute reporting 
timeframe for transactions reported to FINRA's TRACE system to one 
minute.\17\

---------------------------------------------------------------------------

    The Commission stated that granting the 2006 Exemption ``will serve 
the public interest by minimizing unnecessary regulatory disparity and 
promoting competition'' between the corporate debt security 
markets.\18\ The 2006 Exemption required the following conditions in 
order for debt securities not registered under the Exchange Act to 
trade on NYSE Bonds: (1) that the offer and sale of the debt securities 
traded on what is now NYSE Bonds be registered under the Securities 
Act; (2) that the issuer of the debt securities (or its parent if the 
issuer is a wholly-owned subsidiary) have at least one class of equity 
securities registered under Section 12(b) the Exchange Act and listed 
on the NYSE; (3) that the transfer agent for the debt securities be 
registered under Section 17A of the Exchange Act; (4) that the trust 
indenture for the debt security be qualified under the Trust Indenture 
Act of 1939; (5) that the NYSE comply with the undertakings set forth 
in its exemptive application to distinguish between debt securities 
registered under Section 12(b) of the Exchange Act and listed on the 
NYSE and debt securities trading pursuant to the exemptive order; \19\ 
and (6) that the NYSE would delist a class of debt securities that is 
listed on the NYSE as of the date of the order only if the issuer of 
that class of debt security did not object to the delisting of those 
securities.\20\
---------------------------------------------------------------------------

application for exemptive relief, Appendix at 3.
    \20\ See supra note 1 at 67659.
---------------------------------------------------------------------------

    The NYSE posts on its website a list of the bonds that can be 
traded on the NYSE Bonds platform.\21\ As of October 2024, this list 
contained over 8,000 securities. In its application, the NYSE states 
that, of the bonds that can be traded on the NYSE Bonds platform, the 
listed bonds total more than 1,000 securities and represent a notional 
value of about $464 billion, and the unlisted bonds total more than 
7,000 securities and represent a notional value of about $840 
billion.\22\

    \22\ See the NYSE's application for exemptive relief, Appendix 
at 1.
---------------------------------------------------------------------------

II. Summary of the Application

    In its application, the NYSE requests that we amend one of the 
conditions in the 2006 Exemption. That exemption permits the NYSE to 
trade debt securities \23\ not registered under Section 12(b) of the 
Exchange Act on NYSE Bonds subject to certain conditions. One of those 
conditions requires that an issuer, or the issuer's parent if the 
issuer is a wholly-owned subsidiary, have at least one class of common 
or preferred equity securities that is (i) registered under Section 
12(b) of the Exchange Act and (ii) listed on the NYSE. The NYSE asks 
the Commission to amend item (ii) to require that an issuer have at 
least one class of preferred or common equity securities that is listed 
on any registered national security exchange, not just the NYSE. All 
other conditions of the 2006 Exemption, including item (i), would 
remain the same. Specifically, debt securities traded on NYSE Bonds 
would be required to meet the following conditions:
---------------------------------------------------------------------------

    \23\ The 2006 Exemption defines ``debt security'' as any 
security that, if the class of securities were listed on the NYSE, 
would be listed under Sections 102.03 or 103.05 of the NYSE's Listed 
Company Manual. Under this definition, a debt security does not 
include any security that, if the class of securities were listed on 
the NYSE, would be listed under Sections 703.19 or 703.21 of the 
NYSE's Listed Company Manual. A debt security also does not include 
any security that is defined as an ``equity security'' under Section 
3(a)(11) of the Exchange Act [15 U.S.C. 78c(a)(11)]. The references 
to Section 102.03, 103.05, 703.19 and 703.21 of the NYSE's Listed 
Company Manual are to those sections as in effect on January 31, 
2005. The proposed exemptive order would not change this definition.
---------------------------------------------------------------------------

    (a) The issuer of the debt security has registered the offer and 
sale of such security under the Securities Act of 1933; \24\
---------------------------------------------------------------------------

    \24\ 15 U.S.C. 77a.
---------------------------------------------------------------------------

    (b) The issuer of the debt security or the issuer's parent company 
if the issuer is a wholly-owned subsidiary, has at least one class of 
common or preferred equity securities registered under Section 12(b) 
\25\ of the Exchange Act and listed on a registered national security 
exchange;
---------------------------------------------------------------------------

    \25\ 15 U.S.C. 78l(b).
---------------------------------------------------------------------------

    (c) The transfer agent of the debt security is registered under 
Section 17A \26\ of the Exchange Act;
---------------------------------------------------------------------------

    \26\ 15 U.S.C. 78qA.

---------------------------------------------------------------------------

[[Page 87670]]

    (d) The trust indenture for the debt security is qualified under 
the Trust Indenture Act of 1939; \27\
---------------------------------------------------------------------------

    \27\ 15 U.S.C. 77aaa-77bbbb.
---------------------------------------------------------------------------

    (e) The NYSE has complied with the undertakings (see below) set 
forth in its exemptive application to distinguish between debt 
securities registered under Section 12(b) of the Exchange Act and 
listed on the NYSE and debt securities trading pursuant to this 
requested exemptive relief; and
    (f) The NYSE will delist a class of debt securities that were 
listed on the NYSE as of November 16, 2006 only if the issuer of such 
class of debt securities does not object to the delisting of those 
securities.
    The NYSE states that it would continue to comply with the 
undertakings that are a condition of the 2006 Exemption in connection 
with its current request.\28\ Specifically, in its application the NYSE 
states that it would continue to:
---------------------------------------------------------------------------

    \28\ See the NYSE's application for exemptive relief, Appendix 
at 3.
---------------------------------------------------------------------------

    (a) Provide definitions of ``listed'' debt securities and 
``traded'' debt securities on NYSE Bonds and on the NYSE's website;
    (b) Identify on NYSE Bonds and on the NYSE's website whether a 
particular debt security is ``listed'' or ``traded''; \29\
---------------------------------------------------------------------------

    \29\ The NYSE states that it would distinguish debt securities 
``listed'' on NYSE Bonds from those ``traded'' on NYSE Bonds in the 
following manner: (1) The NYSE would uniquely identify ``listed'' 
and ``traded'' debt securities on the NYSE Bonds Bond Directory 
located on the NYSE's website; (2) The NYSE would also make such 
information available on the NYSE Bonds Security Master File on a 
daily basis through ICE Data Services (``IDS''); and (3) The NYSE 
would publish a Trader Update to notify members and member 
organizations each time a debt security becomes available to trade 
on NYSE Bonds.
---------------------------------------------------------------------------

    (c) Directly provide members and member organizations notification 
prior to the date that trading of the debt securities commences on NYSE 
Bonds to clarify the distinction between ``listed'' debt securities and 
``traded'' debt securities and to provide notification that eligible 
debt securities will be traded on NYSE Bonds;
    (d) Issue a press release upon approval of this exemption request 
stating that ``listed'' debt securities would trade alongside 
``traded'' debt securities on NYSE Bonds; and
    (e) Obtain corporate action information from a third-party bond 
issue tracking service for debt securities covered by this request.\30\
---------------------------------------------------------------------------

    \30\ In its application for exemptive relief, the NYSE states 
that the third-party bond issue tracking service it currently uses 
is IDS. It also states in its application that it would use 
information from IDS and FactSet to comply with NYSE Listing Manual 
Rule 1401.
---------------------------------------------------------------------------

    The NYSE states that the current regulatory landscape puts the NYSE 
at a competitive disadvantage vis-[agrave]-vis Alternative Trading 
Systems (``ATSs''), which are permitted to trade any corporate bond 
that is currently available to trade in the secondary market.\31\ NYSE 
states that NYSE Bonds is the only regulated platform for corporate 
bonds that offers firm prices that are live and executable versus what 
it describes as ``subject pricing'' on ATSs.\32\ NYSE also states that 
NYSE Bonds, in contrast to the OTC bond markets, disseminates both last 
sale prices as they occur on NYSE Bonds exclusive of any mark-ups, 
mark-downs, or other charges, and bid and ask quotations. In addition, 
the NYSE states that such market data is accessible instantaneously on 
NYSE Bonds.\33\ The NYSE further states that it is not aware of any 
comparable level of transparency that exists currently elsewhere for 
corporate bond trading.\34\
---------------------------------------------------------------------------

    \31\ See the NYSE's application for exemptive relief, Appendix 
at 6.
    \32\ As stated in NYSE's application for exemptive relief, ATSs 
typically offer dealers on their platforms a ``last look'' to an 
otherwise firm price, which allows the dealer to review the posted 
price prior to any execution. The ``last look'' allows the dealer to 
reject the order if the price is no longer advantageous. NYSE states 
that this practice ``can create a false sense of liquidity in the 
market.'' See the NYSE's application for exemptive relief, Appendix 
at 6.
    \33\ FINRA members generally are required to report transactions 
in corporate bonds to TRACE as soon as practicable but no later than 
15 minutes from the time of execution. See FINRA Rule 6730(a)(1). 
FINRA publicly disseminates information on the transactions reported 
to TRACE immediately upon receipt. See FINRA Rule 6750(a).
    \34\ See the NYSE's application for exemptive relief, Appendix 
at 7.
---------------------------------------------------------------------------

    Section 36 of the Exchange Act grants the Commission the authority 
to ``conditionally or unconditionally exempt any person, security, or 
transaction, or any class or classes of persons, securities, or 
transactions, from any provision or provisions of [the Exchange Act] or 
of any rule or regulation thereunder, to the extent that such exemption 
is necessary or appropriate in the public interest, and is consistent 
with the protection of investors.''
    In order to facilitate investor protection, we propose the 
following additional condition: the NYSE will ensure daily monitoring 
of delistings of equity securities of each issuer whose debt securities 
are listed for trading on NYSE Bonds or, if the issuer of the debt 
securities is a wholly-owned subsidiary, equity securities of the 
issuer's parent company. The Commission preliminarily believes that 
this condition will help protect investors by facilitating appropriate 
monitoring and timely handling of equity security delistings for each 
issuer whose debt securities are listed for trading on NYSE Bonds or, 
if the issuer of the debt securities is a wholly-owned subsidiary, 
equity securities of the issuer's parent company.

III. Request for Comment

    We request and encourage any interested person to submit comments 
regarding the NYSE's application, including whether the request should 
be granted. In particular, we solicit comment on the following 
questions:
    1. Is the scope of the requested exemption appropriate? If not, 
please explain and provide examples of an appropriate scope.
    2. Please describe how the requested exemption would or would not 
protect investors and the public interest. For example, would investors 
lose access to any material information?
    3. Please describe how the requested exemption would or would not 
help to maintain fair and orderly markets.
    4. Would the requested exemption impact competition between 
exchanges and the OTC markets for trading in corporate bonds? If so, 
please describe the impact on competition, and how this impact would 
occur.
    5. Would the requested exemption increase the transparency of the 
public debt markets? If so, please describe the kind of transparency it 
would foster.
    6. Increased trading on the NYSE Bonds platform that might follow 
from the requested exemption would result in greater dissemination of 
last sale prices as they occur on NYSE Bonds exclusive of any mark-ups, 
mark-downs, or other charges, and bid and ask quotations. To what 
extent would the information disseminated by NYSE Bonds and, in 
particular, the pre-trade information improve overall market quality in 
the corporate bond market in terms of access to information, liquidity 
or other factors?
    7. Would the requested exemption impact competition between 
national securities exchanges? If so, explain how.
    8. Would issuers be more or less likely to issue debt securities to 
trade on NYSE Bonds in accordance with this exemptive relief?
    9. Are there differences between issuers, in terms of industry, 
capitalization or other characteristics, who list their equity 
securities on the NYSE and those who list their equity securities on 
other registered national securities exchanges? If so, are there any 
such differences that warrant not expanding the 2006 Exemption as 
requested?

[[Page 87671]]

    10. Are there differences between the listing standards for equity 
securities among national securities exchanges that warrant not 
expanding the 2006 Exemption as requested?
    11. The current condition requiring the issuer of the debt security 
to have at least one class of common or preferred equity securities 
registered under Section 12(b) of the Exchange Act and listed on the 
NYSE was designed to assure that the issuer of debt securities has a 
significant and continuous listing (and oversight) relationship with 
the NYSE. Does the loss of such a direct relationship with the issuer 
under the requested exemption warrant not expanding the 2006 Exemption 
as requested?
    12. Are there particular listing standards for an issuer's listed 
securities the presence of which should be a condition for expanding 
the 2006 Exemption?
    13. Any new or amended listing standards must be filed with the 
Commission, meet the statutory standard and comply with Rule 19b-4, and 
be approved by the Commission. Would approving this request affect the 
incentives of each of the national securities exchanges, including the 
NYSE, to maintain or change its listing standards?
    14. Are there differences between exchange-traded debt securities 
and debt securities traded in the OTC market broadly or on ATSs in 
particular that have developed since 2006 that warrant not expanding 
the 2006 Exemption as requested?
    15. Are there any implications or concerns that may arise because 
NYSE members would be able to trade a debt security of an issuer that 
is not subject to the rules of the NYSE (even with respect to its 
equity securities) and where the NYSE has no formal listing agreement 
with the issuer, and the issuer's equity securities are listed on a 
national securities exchange other than the NYSE?
    16. Should we condition the requested exemption on any additional 
listing standards on any exchange where the issuer's securities are 
listed?
    17. Are the conditions sufficiently designed so that investors are 
appropriately protected?
    18. Is the undertaking regarding the use of corporate action 
information from a third party bond issue tracking service adequate to 
provide the NYSE and its members with sufficient information regarding 
corporate actions relevant to debt securities traded on NYSE Bonds? Is 
such undertaking sufficient for NYSE to ascertain compliance with the 
requirements of NYSE Rule 1401, on initial and continued trading? If 
not, what additional information or measures would be appropriate? 
Should any such additional information or measures be required as an 
additional condition of the exemption?
    19. Should the provision of corporate action information provided 
by a third-party bond issue tracking service to the NYSE and its 
members be a condition of the exemption?
    20. Should we require additional conditions to the requested 
exemption if any of the events identified in the information to be 
provided by the third-party bond issue tracking service to the NYSE 
were to occur?
    21. The NYSE states that it would continue to ``[i]dentify on NYSE 
Bonds and on the NYSE's website whether a particular debt security is 
``listed'' or ``traded'' and the NYSE explains the manner in which it 
would do so.\35\ Should the NYSE also be required to identify the 
exchanges where the equity securities of its NYSE Bond issuers are 
listed? If so, should this identification be required as a condition of 
the exemptive order?
---------------------------------------------------------------------------

    \35\ See the NYSE's application for exemptive relief, Appendix 
at 3.
---------------------------------------------------------------------------

    22. Should we add the proposed condition that the NYSE ensure daily 
monitoring of delistings of equity securities of each issuer whose debt 
securities are listed for trading on NYSE Bonds or, if the issuer of 
the debt securities is a wholly-owned subsidiary, equity securities of 
the issuer's parent company? Would that condition help to ensure 
compliance with the requested exemption and timely handling of an event 
of delisting of such equity securities?
    23. Should we make any other modifications to the existing 
conditions or add any other conditions?
    24. Would the requested change to the listing condition impact any 
of the other conditions to the exemption? If so, which condition or 
conditions, and why?
    25. Would there be any adverse consequences to market participants 
if we granted this exemption as requested?
    Comments should be received on or before December 4, 2024. Comments

Appendix: The New York Stock Exchange LLC's Application for an 
Exemption Pursuant to Section 36 of the Exchange Act

Appendix

April 12, 2024

Vanessa Countryman
Secretary
Securities and Exchange Commission
100 F Street NE
Washington, DC 20549-1090

Dear Ms. Countryman:


[[Page 87672]]


    The New York Stock Exchange LLC (the ``Exchange'' or ``NYSE'') 
requests that the Securities and Exchange Commission (the 
``Commission'') amend a single term of previously granted exemptive 
relief to permit Exchange members and member organizations to trade 
certain debt securities that are not registered under Section 12(b) 
\1\ of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 (the ``Exchange 
Act'').\2\
---------------------------------------------------------------------------

    \1\ 15 U.S.C. 78l(b).
    \2\ 15 U.S.C. 78a.
---------------------------------------------------------------------------

Background/Exemptive Relief Requested

    Section 12(a) \3\ of the Exchange Act provides that it shall be 
unlawful for any ``member, broker, or dealer to effect any 
transaction in any security (other than an exempted security) on a 
national securities exchange unless a registration is effective as 
to such security for such exchange.''
---------------------------------------------------------------------------

    \3\ 15 U.S.C. 78l(a).
---------------------------------------------------------------------------

    In 2006, the Commission granted exemptive relief from Section 
12(a) of the Exchange Act to permit Exchange members and member 
organizations to trade unregistered debt securities on the NYSE's 
Automated Bond System (ABS),\4\ now known as ``NYSE Bonds.'' \5\
---------------------------------------------------------------------------

    \4\ See Exchange Act Release No. 54766 (November 16, 2006), 71 
FR 67657 (November 22, 2006) (Order Granting the New York Stock 
Exchange Inc.'s (n/k/a the New York Stock Exchange LLC) Application 
for an Exemption Pursuant to Section 36 of the Securities Exchange 
Act of 1934) (the ``2006 Exemption''). See also Letter from Mary 
Yeager, New York Stock Exchange, to Jonathan G. Katz, Secretary, 
Securities and Exchange Commission, dated May 26, 2005 (NYSE's 
request for exemptive relief).
    \5\ See Securities Exchange Act Release No. 55496 (March 20, 
2007), 72 FR 14631 (March 28, 2007) (SR-NYSE-2006-37) (Order 
Granting Accelerated Approval of Proposed Rule Change Relating to 
the Establishment of NYSE Bonds).
---------------------------------------------------------------------------

    The 2006 Exemption is limited to debt securities of an issuer, 
or a wholly-owned subsidiary of an issuer, with at least one class 
of common or preferred equity securities that is (i) registered 
under Section 12(b) of the Exchange Act and (ii) listed on the NYSE. 
The Exchange now asks the Commission to amend this single 
limitation. As amended, unregistered debt securities could be traded 
on NYSE Bonds if their issuer (or their issuer's parent) had a class 
of common or preferred equity listed on any registered national 
securities exchange, not just the NYSE. All other terms of the 2006 
Exemption would remain in effect.
    More specifically, if the Commission were to grant the 
Exchange's request, in order for an unregistered debt security to be 
traded on NYSE Bonds, the debt security would have to meet the 
following conditions:
    (a) The issuer of the debt securities registered the offer and 
sale of that class of debt securities under the Securities Act of 
1933, as amended (the ``1933 Act''); \6\
---------------------------------------------------------------------------

    \6\ 15 U.S.C. 77a.
---------------------------------------------------------------------------

    (b) The issuer of the debt securities or the issuer's parent, if 
the issuer is a wholly-owned subsidiary, has at least one class of 
common or preferred equity securities registered under Section 12(b) 
\7\ of the Exchange Act and listed on any registered national 
securities exchange;
---------------------------------------------------------------------------

    \7\ 15 U.S.C. 78l(b).
---------------------------------------------------------------------------

    (c) The transfer agent for the debt securities is registered 
under Section 17A \8\ of the Exchange Act; \9\
---------------------------------------------------------------------------

    \8\ 15 U.S.C. 78qA.
    \9\ If the Commission grants exemptive relief from Section 
12(a), members, brokers and dealers would be able to trade on the 
NYSE eligible debt securities that have not been registered under 
Section 12(b), which prescribes the procedures for an issuer's 
registration of a security and the information required to be 
submitted. Similarly, the Exchange would no longer need to comply 
with the provisions of Section 12(d) regarding the certification of 
listing and registration of debt securities.
---------------------------------------------------------------------------

    (d) The trust indenture for the debt security is qualified under 
the Trust Indenture Act of 1939,\10\
---------------------------------------------------------------------------

    \10\ 15 U.S.C. 77aaa-77bbbb.
---------------------------------------------------------------------------

    (e) The NYSE has complied with the undertakings (see below) set 
forth in its exemptive application to distinguish between debt 
securities registered under Section 12(b) of the Exchange Act and 
listed on the NYSE and debt securities trading pursuant to this 
requested exemptive relief; and
    (f) The NYSE will delist a class of debt securities that were 
listed on the NYSE as of November 16, 2006 only if the issuer of 
such class of debt securities does not object to the delisting of 
those securities.
    In connection with the 2006 Exemption, the Exchange undertook 
that it would take or had taken a number of specified steps. The 
Exchange undertakes that it will continue to provide this same 
information in connection with this request. Specifically, the NYSE 
will continue to:
    (a) Provide definitions of ``listed'' debt securities and 
``traded'' debt securities on NYSE Bonds and on the NYSE's website;
    (b) Identify on NYSE Bonds and on the NYSE's website whether a 
particular debt security is ``listed'' or ``traded''; \11\
---------------------------------------------------------------------------

    \11\ The NYSE will distinguish debt securities ``listed'' on 
NYSE Bonds from those ``traded'' on NYSE Bonds in the following 
manner: (1) The Exchange will uniquely identify ``listed'' and 
``traded'' debt securities on the NYSE Bonds Bond Directory located 
on the NYSE's website; (2) The Exchange will also make such 
information available on the NYSE Bonds Security Master File on a 
daily basis through ICE Data Services (``IDS''); and (3) The 
Exchange will publish a Trader Update to notify members and member 
organizations each time a debt security becomes available to trade 
on NYSE Bonds.
---------------------------------------------------------------------------

    (c) The NYSE will directly provide members and member 
organizations notification prior to the date that trading of the 
debt securities commences on NYSE Bonds to clarify the distinction 
between ``listed'' debt securities and ``traded'' debt securities 
and to provide notification that eligible debt securities will be 
traded on NYSE Bonds;
    (d) Issue a press release upon approval of this exemption 
request stating that ``listed'' debt securities would trade 
alongside ``traded'' debt securities on NYSE Bonds; and
    (e) Obtain corporate action information from IDS for debt 
securities covered by this request.
    With respect to undertaking (e), IDS, an affiliate of the 
Exchange, is a bond issue tracking service that provides the NYSE a 
customized on-line reference for corporate actions relevant to 
bonds. The tracking system provides information and data 
electronically to the NYSE, and provides:
    <bullet> Notification of calls (redemptions) of traded bonds,
    <bullet> Notification of tender offers for traded bonds,
    <bullet> Notice of defaults in payment of interest on traded 
bonds,
    <bullet> Notice of consent solicitations for traded bonds, and
    <bullet> Notice of corporate actions for traded bonds (includes 
tender offers, issuer name changes, CUSIP number changes).
    The tracking system does not provide notification of changes in 
trustees, obligors or transfer agents with respect to traded debt 
securities. NYSE receives this information electronically from IDS 
on a daily basis. IDS independently obtains, researches and 
organizes the information. The NYSE does not itself verify the 
information provided by IDS.
    NYSE currently has rules that set forth the requirements for 
trading unlisted debt securities on NYSE Bonds.\12\ Rule 1400 
provides:
---------------------------------------------------------------------------

    \12\ See NYSE Rules 1400 and 1401.
---------------------------------------------------------------------------

    ``The term Debt Securities includes only securities that, if 
they were to be listed on the NYSE, would be listed under Sections 
102.03 or 103.05 of the NYSE's Listed Company Manual; provided, 
however, that such securities shall not include any security that is 
defined as an ``equity security'' under Section 3(a)(11) of the 
Exchange Act.
    For the avoidance of doubt, note that the term Debt Securities 
does not include a security that, if listed on the NYSE, would have 
been listed under Section 703.19 of the NYSE's Listed Company Manual 
or any equity-linked debt securities listed under Rule 5P. The 
references in this Rule to Sections 102.03, 103.05, and 703.19 of 
the NYSE's Listed Company Manual are to those sections as in effect 
on January 31, 2005.''
    Rule 1401 specifies that only Debt Securities with an 
outstanding market value or principal amount of at least $5 million 
will be permitted to be traded by NYSE members and member 
organizations. Rule 1401 also specifies that trading in Debt 
Securities will be suspended if (a) the outstanding aggregate market 
value or principal amount of the Debt Securities has fallen to less 
than $1,000,000, or (b) the Debt Securities either (1) no longer 
qualify for a statutory exemption from the registration requirements 
of Section 12(b) of the Exchange Act, or (2) may no longer be traded 
by NYSE members or member organizations on an unregistered basis 
pursuant to the 2006 Exemption.
    In order to ensure that Debt Securities have at least $5,000,000 
in aggregate market value or principal amount at the time trading 
commences, as required under Rule 1401(1), the NYSE, as it currently 
does, will review two existing corporate bond issue databases (IDS 
and FactSet) that provide issue size information for the 
preponderance of corporate bonds.
    To monitor the $1,000,000 suspension threshold, as required 
under Rule 1401(2),

[[Page 87673]]

the NYSE will generally utilize, as it currently does, IDS' tracking 
system to monitor partial redemptions and tender offers. The most 
prevalent reason for outstanding principal amounts to fall below $1 
million is when an issuer commences a partial redemption of the 
bonds resulting in a smaller amount of bonds outstanding and by 
extension, a drop in the aggregate market value or principal amount 
to below the $1,000,000 threshold.
    The NYSE intends to provide an opportunity for NYSE members and 
member organizations to trade all eligible debt securities. Once 
eligible debt securities are identified, the NYSE will notify NYSE 
members and member organizations that such debt securities are 
eligible to be traded on NYSE Bonds through Trader Updates and 
postings on the NYSE website. Debt securities that would be 
ineligible for trading include convertible debt securities, debt 
securities that were listed under Section 703.19 of the NYSE's 
Listed Company Manual, debt issued by listed company subsidiaries 
that are not wholly-owned, and foreign government debt.

Discussion

    The NYSE believes that increased exchange trading of debt 
securities will have substantial benefits to market participants in 
the form of greater transparency around pricing and issuer 
information. The regulatory structure around trading of debt 
securities, however, has not sufficiently incentivized trading on a 
regulated national securities exchange. Presently, all equity and 
debt securities that are not ``exempted securities'' or are not 
otherwise exempt from Exchange Act registration must be registered 
by the issuer under the Exchange Act before a member, broker or 
dealer may trade that class of securities on a national securities 
exchange. By contrast, brokers or dealers who trade debt securities 
in the over-the-counter, or OTC, market may trade debt securities 
regardless of whether the issuer registered that class of debt under 
the Exchange Act. In fact, debt securities traded OTC need not even 
be issued by reporting companies.
    The Commission has taken a number of steps over the years to 
address its view ``that this disparate regulatory treatment may have 
negatively and unnecessarily affected the structure and development 
of the debt markets.'' \13\ In 1994, the Commission adopted Exchange 
Act Rule 3a12-11 to ``reduce regulatory distinctions between 
exchange-traded debt securities required to be registered under 
Section 12 of the Exchange Act and bonds traded over-the-counter for 
which such registration is not required.'' \14\
---------------------------------------------------------------------------

    \13\ See 2006 Exemption, supra note 4, at 67658.
    \14\ 17 CFR 240.3a12-11. The Commission, among other things, 
exempted debt securities listed on a national securities exchange 
from Sections 14(a), 14(b) and 14(c) of the Exchange Act. 15 U.S.C. 
78n(a), (b) and (c).
---------------------------------------------------------------------------

    The Commission has also sought to increase the level of 
transparency in the public debt markets. In this regard, the 
National Association of Securities Dealers, Inc. (``NASD''), now the 
Financial Industry Regulatory Authority, Inc. (``FINRA''), 
introduced TRACE (Trade Reporting and Compliance Engine) to bring 
transparency to the bond market by providing comprehensive, real-
time access to bond price information. Introduced in 2002, TRACE 
captures and disseminates consolidated information on secondary 
market transactions in publicly traded TRACE-eligible securities--
representing all OTC market activity in these bonds.
    The Commission's 2006 Exemption was another step to ``serve the 
public interest by minimizing unnecessary regulatory disparity and 
promoting competition.'' \15\ Pursuant to the 2006 Exemption, the 
Exchange currently lists on its NYSE Bonds platform more than 1,000 
CUSIPs, representing a notional value of about $464 billion, and 
trades more than 7,000 CUSIPs, representing a notional value of 
about $840 billion. The Exchange believes that its present request 
will further increase exchange trading of debt securities to the 
benefit of investors and other market participants.
---------------------------------------------------------------------------

    \15\ See 2006 Exemption, supra note 4, at 67659.
---------------------------------------------------------------------------

NYSE Bonds

    NYSE Bonds is an electronic order-driven matching system \16\ 
for fixed income securities to which Exchange members and member 
organizations subscribe and through which they enter and match 
customer bond orders on a strict price and time priority basis. The 
system provides member subscribers with access to the order book in 
each bond which displays orders and in the time sequence received. 
Completed, locked-in trades are submitted to the clearing 
corporation (i.e., Depository Trust Clearing Corporation) with 
calculated accrued interest. NYSE Bonds centralizes bond trading and 
publishes a real-time bond data feed to NYSE Bonds customers and 
subscribers that reflects all orders in time sequence on the NYSE 
Bonds order book. NYSE Bonds is an order-driven system and, 
therefore, the Exchange does not disseminate any information on a 
particular bond if there are no orders entered on the order book for 
such bond.
---------------------------------------------------------------------------

    \16\ See supra note 5.
---------------------------------------------------------------------------

    NYSE Bonds primarily serves the ``small-lot'' corporate bond 
market. Small-lot bond buyers and sellers are primarily individuals, 
bank trust accounts, and small institutions. In addition, bond 
dealers use NYSE Bonds to offset so-called ``tail-end'' bond 
positions acquired in the course of large-lot trading. NYSE Bonds is 
the only system that provides the public with real-time disclosure 
of quotations and trade prices, exclusive of mark-ups/mark-downs, 
commissions, or other charges.
    Growth in electronic trading of corporate bonds has been 
noteworthy. It has been decades in the making, but electronic 
trading in corporate bonds has made notable inroads in a market 
known for its low-tech ways. In November 2023, 45% of US investment-
grade bond volume was traded electronically.\17\ During that month, 
the average daily notional volume traded grew 13% year over year to 
$43 billion, with $18.8 billion of corporate bonds trading 
electronically, representing an 18% growth from November of 
2022.\18\ The vast majority of those electronic transactions occur 
on Alternative Trading Systems (``ATSs''), which are permitted to 
trade any corporate bond that is currently available to trade in the 
secondary market. This universe of bonds represents approximately 
62,000 CUSIPs with a notional value of over $10 trillion. The 
current regulatory landscape not only puts NYSE Bonds at a 
competitive disadvantage to the ATSs, it also puts investors at a 
disadvantage given that NYSE Bonds is the only regulated platform 
for corporate bonds that offers firm prices that are live and 
executable versus subject pricing on ATSs which can create a false 
sense of liquidity in the market. ATSs typically offer dealers on 
their platforms a ``last look'' to an otherwise firm price, which 
allows the dealer to review the posted price prior to any execution. 
The ``last look'' allows the dealer to reject the order if the price 
is no longer advantageous. On the contrary, all prices on NYSE Bonds 
are live and executable and are matched based on price/time priority 
automatically by the matching engine.

Drought Over?, Greenwich Associates (2023).
    \18\ Id.
---------------------------------------------------------------------------

    In addition, the Exchange believes that investors in debt 
securities are adversely impacted by the competitive constraints on 
exchanges trading debt securities. In contrast to OTC markets 
trading debt securities, the Exchange's bond market disseminates 
both last sale prices as they occur on the Exchange exclusive of any 
mark-ups, mark-downs, or other charges, and bid and ask quotations. 
This market data is available through some 400,000 market data 
displays providing subscribers--primarily securities firms and 
financial institutions--with direct instantaneous access to this 
information, throughout each trading day. The Exchange is not aware 
of any comparable level of transparency--trade prices, quotations, 
and speed of availability for corporate bond prices--that exists 
currently elsewhere. This transparency is absent when a bond delists 
from, or is not traded on, the Exchange.\19\
---------------------------------------------------------------------------

    \19\ One instance in which this transparency may be lost is when 
a company with both listed equity and debt is merged or reorganizes 
with another company. The successor may list its stock on the 
Exchange but leave its debt in a now wholly-owned subsidiary, which 
may seek to delist its debt to avoid separate Section 13 reporting 
requirements. Once delisted from the Exchange, the debt is traded 
only OTC, and the Exchange believes that investors lose the benefit 
of the transparency provided by the real time reporting of 
quotations and trades on the Exchange.
---------------------------------------------------------------------------

Bond Issue Information

    The Exchange believes that increasing the universe of 
unregistered debt securities that may be traded on the Exchange will 
have significant benefits to market participants. First, the 
Exchange's proposal will not result in any loss of debt security or 
issuer information to investors for the following reasons: The 
Exchange is only requesting exemptive relief with respect to the 
trading by Exchange members and member organization of debt 
securities issued by companies listed on a national securities

[[Page 87674]]

exchange and their wholly-owned subsidiaries. All such issuers are 
already subject to the requirements of Section 13 of the Exchange 
Act, and thus information about an issuer will be available to 
investors, even in the absence of an Exchange Act registration 
requirement for the debt securities of these issuers or their 
wholly-owned subsidiaries.
    Only debt securities that are registered under the 1933 Act 
would be eligible to be traded by NYSE members and member 
organizations on NYSE Bonds. Additionally, under Section 15(d) of 
the Exchange Act, issuers not required to register their debt 
securities under Section 12 of the Exchange Act are subject to 
Section 13 reporting requirements for the fiscal year following the 
effective date of a registration statement filed under the 1933 
Act.\20\ Issuers must continue to file such reports so long as they 
have a class of securities with at least 300 ``holders of record'' 
as defined under Exchange Act Rule 12g5-1.\21\ Therefore, with 
respect to eligible debt securities that have been issued by the 
wholly-owned subsidiary of a listed company, that wholly-owned 
subsidiary may or may not itself be currently subject to the 
requirements of Section 15(d) or Section 13 of the Exchange Act.
---------------------------------------------------------------------------

    \20\ 15 U.S.C. 78o(d) (2000).
    \21\ 17 CFR 240.12g5-1.
---------------------------------------------------------------------------

    The 1933 Act registration statements themselves supply much of 
the relevant information needed by the bond markets and investors. 
Indeed, for the most part, the Exchange Act registration Form 8-A 
simply incorporates by reference the information found in the 1933 
Act registration statement. The 1933 Act registration statement also 
contains a much more detailed and relevant description of the debt 
issue than is required by Rule 12b-3 of the Exchange Act.\22\ The 
description contained in the term sheet of the registration 
statement provides the information necessary to trade that issue--
whether on an exchange or OTC. The issue description contained in 
the Form 8-A registration statement does not provide the information 
needed to trade bonds.
---------------------------------------------------------------------------

    \22\ 17 CFR 240.12b-3. Rule 12b-3 requires that wherever the 
title of securities is required to be stated one shall also indicate 
``the type and general character of the securities. . . .'' For 
funded debt, issuers are required to state the following: the rate 
of interest, the maturity date (or dates for serial issues), an 
indication if the payment of principal or interest is contingent, a 
brief indication of the priority of the issue, and, if the issue is 
convertible, a statement to that effect.
---------------------------------------------------------------------------

    Most of the other disclosure items required in connection with 
debt securities arise with respect to Forms 8-K, 10-Q and 10-K. 
These forms would continue to be filed by eligible listed companies 
and, where required by Sections 15(d) or 13 under the Exchange Act, 
by eligible wholly-owned subsidiaries, regardless of whether the 
debt securities are registered under the Exchange Act. Item 2.04 of 
Form 8-K requires disclosure of any triggering event, such as a 
default, that accelerates or increases a direct financial 
obligation. Item 3.03 of Form 8-K requires disclosure of any 
material modification to the rights of security holders. Item 
601(b)(4) of Regulation S-K (required to be included in 10-Ks and 
10-Qs) discusses the definition of the rights of debt holders. Part 
II--Item 3(a) of Form 10-Q requires that, to the extent that the 
registrant has not previously disclosed such information on Form 8-
K, the registrant must provide information regarding defaults in the 
payment of principal, interest, sinking fund, etc., ``with respect 
to any indebtedness of the registrant or any of its significant 
subsidiaries exceeding 5 percent of the total assets of the 
registrant and its consolidated subsidiaries . . .'' (emphasis 
added). Thus, the Form 10-Q requires disclosure of defaults in the 
payment of principal, interest, sinking fund, etc. for any bonds of 
the registrant, irrespective of whether such bonds are exchange-
listed or not.
    If, as described above, a wholly-owned subsidiary ceases to 
provide Exchange Act reports itself, much of the information that 
had been provided by the wholly-owned subsidiary will be provided 
instead by the wholly-owned subsidiary's listed parent company in 
its own Exchange Act reports. The listed parent company, however, 
will not be required to list and describe the debt securities issued 
by the wholly-owned subsidiary on the cover page of its own annual 
report on Form 10-K or to include as an exhibit to its own Forms 10-
K or 10-Q the exhibits that would have been required to be filed by 
the wholly-owned subsidiary pursuant to Item 601(b)(4) of Regulation 
S-K (relating to creation of a new class of securities or 
indebtedness or the modification of existing rights of security 
holders).
    There are also a variety of databases providing bond 
information, including information regarding the listing and/or 
trading location of a bond. A few examples of these database 
services include Standard & Poor's Market Intelligence, the Mergent 
Bond Record, APEX, Bloomberg and the Commission's EDGAR internet 
service, among other services. In addition, the Exchange's own bond 
issue directory is available on the Exchange's website and carries 
the description of each listed bond issue, including bonds currently 
exempt from Exchange Act registration requirements, such as 
Tennessee Valley Authority bonds.
    Most notably, of course, OTC bond trading functions without the 
information obtained as a result of Exchange Act registration. OTC 
bond trading relies on the information disclosed in the 1933 Act 
registration statement and the indentures filed under the Trust 
Indenture Act, including amendments to the indenture affecting the 
rights of bondholders.
    In addition to helping ensure that investors have access to 
current information about debt securities traded on the Exchange, 
the NYSE's present request will have additional benefits. First, the 
request will increase competition by allowing more exchanges to 
provide a trading venue for debt securities which will, in turn, 
likely increase trading volume and liquidity of debt securities. 
This will provide investors and market participants with greater 
pricing transparency for bonds traded on the Exchange. In granting 
an exemption pursuant to Section 36 of the Exchange Act, the 
Commission must consider whether the requested exemption is 
``necessary or appropriate in the public interest, and is consistent 
with the protection of investors.'' \23\ For the reasons discussed 
herein, the Exchange believes its requested relief meets this 
standard. If granted, investors will have corporate information 
about the issuer of debt securities, there will be increased numbers 
of trading venues for debt securities, and the resulting growth in 
trading will provide market participants with greater pricing 
transparency.
---------------------------------------------------------------------------

    \23\ 15 U.S.C. 78a.
---------------------------------------------------------------------------

Conclusion

    The Exchange believes that its request to amend a single term of 
the 2006 Exemption to permit unregistered debt securities to be 
traded on NYSE Bonds if their issuer (or their issuer's parent) had 
a class of common or preferred equity listed on any registered 
national securities exchange will further the Commission's goals of 
improving transparency in the bond market while also providing 
sufficient safeguards for the investing public. In remarks at City 
Week, Chair Gensler outlined targeted initiatives to improve 
transparency, resiliency, integrity, and access in fixed-income 
markets.\24\ ``Together, through driving greater transparency, 
modernizing rule sets for electronified platforms, and enhancing 
financial resiliency, we can help investors and issuers in the bond 
markets get the same benefits as many other parts of our capital 
markets,'' said Gensler.\25\ Pre-trade transparency in particular 
has been identified as a key area for improvement in the fixed 
income markets.

    As noted above, the Commission has already shown its willingness 
to lessen the opaqueness in the bond market by providing exemptive 
relief to the Exchange pursuant to which the Exchange currently 
trades debt securities of issuers that are listed on NYSE and such 
issuers' wholly-owned subsidiaries. By extending this exemption to 
allow Exchange members and member organizations to trade debt 
securities of issuers that are listed on any national securities 
exchange and such issuers' wholly-owned subsidiaries would further 
remove unnecessary and anti-competitive barriers to exchange trading 
of debt securities. In addition, trading of such debt securities on 
NYSE Bonds would provide market participants trading such 
securities, as well as the owners of such securities, much greater 
levels of price transparency than is currently available. 
Accordingly, we urge the Commission to use its exemptive power to 
remove the requirement that debt securities of non-NYSE-listed 
equity issuers and their wholly-owned subsidiaries be registered 
under the Exchange Act in order to be traded on the Exchange.

Sincerely,

Hope M. Jarkowski
