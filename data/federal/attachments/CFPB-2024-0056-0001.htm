SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION: 
    Title of Collection: Survey Screening Questions.
    OMB Control Number: 3170-00XX.
    Type of Review: New information collection.
    Affected Public: Individuals.
    Estimated Number of Respondents: 50,000.
    Estimated Total Annual Burden Hours: 12,500.
    Abstract: The CFPB conducts a variety of research efforts to 
ascertain financial issues the American public may be experiencing. The 
CFPB developed a list of potential screener questions formulated to 
allow their research efforts to focus on the appropriate consumers for 
each study and strengthen our ability to address financial needs and 
concerns of the public and to improve the CFPB's delivery of services 
and programs. Usage of the included questions will ensure CFPB's future 
survey efforts target applicable respondents, reduce administrative 
burden on the CFPB, and grant greater flexibility in conducting 
research on emergent financial issues.
    Request for Comments: The CFPB published a 60-day Federal Register 
notice on October 2, 2024 (89 FR 80231) under Docket Number: CFPB-2024-
0050. The CFPB is publishing this notice and soliciting comments on: 
(a) Whether the collection of information is necessary for the proper 
performance of the functions of the CFPB, including whether the 
information will have practical utility; (b) The accuracy of the CFPB's 
estimate of the burden of the collection of information, including the 
validity of the methods and the assumptions used; (c) Ways to enhance 
the quality, utility, and clarity of the information to be collected; 
and (d) Ways to minimize the burden of the collection of information on 
respondents, including through the use of automated collection 
techniques or other forms of information technology. Comments submitted 
in response to this notice will be reviewed by OMB as part of its 
review of this request. All comments will become a matter of public 
record.

Anthony May,
Paperwork Reduction Act Officer, Consumer Financial Protection Bureau.
