SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION: 
    Title: Regulations and Forms Pertaining to the Financial Integrity 
of the Marketplace (OMB Control No. 3038-0024). This is a request for 
an extension of a currently approved information collection.
    Abstract: The Commission is the independent federal regulatory 
agency charged with providing various forms of customer protection so 
that users of the commodity markets can be assured of the financial 
integrity of the markets and the intermediaries that they employ in 
their trading activities. Part 1 of the Commission's regulations 
requires, among other things, that commodity brokers--known as futures 
commission merchants (``FCMs''), or Introducing Brokers (``IBs''), 
comply with certain minimum financial requirements. In order to monitor 
compliance with these financial standards, the Commission has required 
FCMs and IBs to file financial reports with the Commission and with the 
designated self-regulatory organization of which they are members as 
well as to report to the Commission should certain financial 
requirements drop below prescribed minimums.
    In 2008, the U.S. Congress passed the Food, Conservation, and 
Energy Act of 2008, Public Law 110-246, 122 Stat. 1651, 2189-2204 
(2008), also known as the Farm Bill. The Farm Bill provided the 
Commission with new authority with regard to the regulation of off-
exchange retail forex transactions. Among other things, it directed the 
Commission to draft rules effectuating registration provisions for a 
new category of registrant--the retail foreign exchange dealer 
(``RFED''). Under the terms of the legislation, RFEDs are subject to 
the same capital requirements as FCMs that are engaged in retail forex 
transactions, and, therefore, subject to the same reporting 
requirements. Accordingly, this collection was amended to reflect the 
financial reporting requirements of the new category of registrant, 
RFEDs.
    In 2010, the U.S. Congress passed the Wall Street Reform and 
Consumer Protection Act (the ``Dodd-Frank Act''), Public Law 111-203, 
124 Stat. 1376 (2010), giving the Commission the authority to regulate 
certain swap markets and participants in those markets. Section 731 of 
the Dodd-Frank Act, amended the Commodity Exchange Act (``CEA''), 7 
U.S.C. 1 et seq., to add, as section 4s(e) thereof, provisions 
concerning the setting of capital and initial and variation margin 
requirements for swap dealers (``SDs'') and major swap participants 
(``MSPs''). In 2016 and 2020 respectively, the Commission finalized the 
Margin Requirements for Uncleared Swaps for Swap Dealers and Major Swap 
Participants rule and the Capital Requirements for Swap Dealers and 
Major Swap Participants rule to implement those requirements. 
Specifically, such rules include financial reporting and recordkeeping, 
as well as application processes for model approval for both capital 
and margin models for SDs and MSPs that do not have a prudential 
regulator (``Covered Swap Entities'' or ``CSEs'').
    Separately, in 2013, the Commission finalized rules in an effort to 
prevent unauthorized usage of customer funds by FCMs and RFEDs. The 
final rules included modifications to the reporting requirements 
required by the Commission which resulted in changes to the financial 
statements filed by FCMs and RFEDs, and made some of the recordkeeping 
requirements already contained in this OMB Collection Number 3038-0024 
into reporting requirements. These rules added additional recordkeeping 
requirements by FCMs to assure the segregation of customer funds. This 
collection, OMB Control No. 3038-0024, is needed for the Commission to 
continue its financial monitoring of its registrants.
    An agency may not conduct or sponsor, and a person is not required 
to respond to, a collection of information unless it displays a 
currently valid OMB control number. On April 29, 2022, the Commission 
published in the Federal Register notice of the proposed extension of 
this information collection and provided 60 days for public comment on 
the proposed extension, 87 FR 25468 (``60-Day Notice''). The Commission 
did not receive any relevant comments on the 60-Day Notice.
    Burden Statement: The Commission is revising its estimate of the 
burden for this collection to reflect the current number of respondents 
and estimated burden hours. The Commission is revising its estimate of 
the burden for this collection for approximately 61 FCMs and RFEDs, 53 
CSEs and 1,019 IBs. The respondent burden for this collection is 
estimated to be as follows:
    Estimated Number of Respondents: 1,133.
    Estimated Average Burden Hours per Respondent: 251 hours.\2\
---------------------------------------------------------------------------

    \2\ Rounded off from 250.7714033.
---------------------------------------------------------------------------

    Estimated Total Annual Burden Hours: 284,124 hours.\3\
---------------------------------------------------------------------------

    \3\ This figure is derived from 250.7714033 (burden hours per 
respondent) x 1,133 respondents = 284,124.
---------------------------------------------------------------------------

    Frequency of Collection: At various intervals.\4\
---------------------------------------------------------------------------

    \4\ For example, FCMs have both daily and monthly financial 
reporting obligations, annual certified financial and compliance 
report obligations, and periodic notice requirements.
---------------------------------------------------------------------------

    There are no capital costs or operating and maintenance costs 
associated with this collection.

(Authority: 44 U.S.C. 3501 et seq.)

    Dated: June 27, 2022.
Robert Sidman,
Deputy Secretary of the Commission.
