I. Background

A. Digital Millennium Copyright Act and the Trade Facilitation and 
Trade Enforcement Act of 2015

    Title III of the Trade Facilitation and Trade Enforcement Act of 
2015 (Pub. L. 114-125; 130 Stat. 122; Section 628A of the Tariff Act of 
1930 (19 U.S.C. 1628a), as amended) (TFTEA), made several significant 
changes to the U.S. Customs and Border Protection (CBP) procedures 
related to the importation of merchandise that violates or is suspected 
of violating intellectual property rights (IPR). Among the changes made 
by TFTEA are certain provisions regarding enforcement of the Digital 
Millennium Copyright Act (Pub. L. 105-304, 112 Stat. 2860, as amended 
by Pub. L. 106-113, 113 Stat. 1536, (codified at 17 U.S.C. 1201)) 
(DMCA). The DMCA prohibits the importation of devices used to 
circumvent the technological measures employed by certain copyright 
owners to protect their works (``copyright protection measures'').
    Section 303(a) of TFTEA amended section 596(c)(2) of the Tariff Act 
of 1930 (19 U.S.C. 1595a(c)(2)) by adding subparagraph (G) (19 U.S.C. 
1595a(c)(2)(G)), which provides that CBP may seize merchandise 
containing a circumvention device violating the DMCA. Section 303(b) of 
TFTEA states that, when merchandise containing a circumvention device 
is seized pursuant to 19 U.S.C. 1595a(c)(2)(G), CBP must disclose to 
persons injured by that circumvention device information regarding the 
seized merchandise that is equivalent to the information disclosed to 
copyright owners when merchandise is seized for violation of the 
copyright laws.
    Section 302 of TFTEA amended the Tariff Act of 1930 by inserting a 
new section 628A (19 U.S.C. 1628a) authorizing CBP to make certain pre-
seizure information disclosures to owners of properly recorded 
trademarks or copyrights that may comprise information otherwise 
protected by the Trade Secrets Act (18 U.S.C. 1905). CBP is authorized 
to disclose information when CBP determines that these disclosures 
would assist CBP in determining whether the imported merchandise 
suspected of violating the IPR laws actually violates 17 U.S.C. 602 
(copyright), 17 U.S.C. 1201 (circumvention devices), or 19 U.S.C. 1526 
(trademark), as long as the disclosures would not compromise an ongoing 
law enforcement investigation or national security. Specifically, 
section 302(a) of TFTEA (19 U.S.C. 1628a(a)) permits CBP to disclose to 
the right holder information that appears on the imported merchandise 
and its packaging and labels, including unredacted images of the 
merchandise and its packaging and labels. CBP also may, subject to any 
applicable bonding requirements, release unredacted samples of the 
merchandise to the right holder.

B. Notice of Proposed Rulemaking

    On October 16, 2019, the Enforcement of Copyrights and the Digital 
Millennium Copyright Act notice of proposed rulemaking (NPRM) was 
published in the Federal Register (84 FR 55251). The NPRM proposed 
changes to 19 CFR part 133 necessary to implement the applicable 
provisions of title III of TFTEA, clarify the definition of ``piratical 
articles,'' provide for procedural safeguards to limit the release of 
information concerning non-violative shipments, simplify the detention 
process related to merchandise suspected of violating the copyright 
laws, and clarify the existing CBP procedures for post-seizure 
disclosures.

C. Changes From the Proposed Rule for Applying to CBP for DMCA 
Protections

    Section 133.47 provides for post-seizure disclosures to persons 
injured by a circumvention device, as defined in Sec.  133.47(a)(4), 
who have successfully applied for and been approved by CBP for DMCA 
protections as provided in Sec.  133.47(b)(2)(iii). Section 
133.47(b)(2)(iii) announces the establishment of a list of persons 
approved by CBP to receive such post-seizure disclosures. In response 
to the public comments received, as discussed in more detail below, 
this final rule expands the ways that an eligible person, as defined in 
Sec.  133.47(a)(3), may apply to CBP for these DMCA protections. 
Eligible persons may apply for such DMCA protections when this final 
rule becomes effective by attaching a letter requesting such 
disclosures to an application to record or renew a copyright. Owners of 
existing recorded copyrights may apply for these DMCA protections by 
submitting a letter requesting such disclosures to the Intellectual 
Property Enforcement Branch of Regulations and Rulings at 
<a href="/cdn-cgi/l/email-protection#155d445c45475767747b767d557677653b717d663b727a63"><span class="__cf_email__" data-cfemail="e8a0b9a1b8baaa9a89868b80a88b8a98c68c809bc68f879e">[email&#160;protected]</span></a>. Pursuant to section 303(b)(2) of TFTEA, CBP 
will publish a notice, signed by the Executive Director, Regulations 
and Rulings, in the Federal Register when the list is established. CBP 
will also publish the necessary revisions to the list in a notice 
signed by the Executive Director, Regulations and Rulings, in the 
Federal Register on, at minimum, an annual basis, every September.

II. Discussion of Comments

    CBP received six public submissions in response to the NPRM. One 
submission was unresponsive and contained no specifics about the NPRM, 
copyrights, or IPR. The remaining five submissions supported the 
proposed rule's intent but sought clarifications, raised concerns, and/
or made recommendations for improvements. The five submissions each 
contained multiple comments. The comments have been grouped together 
below based on the general topic.

A. Bond Requirements for Right Holders To Obtain Samples From CBP

    Prior to CBP's releasing a sample of imported merchandise pursuant 
to Sec.  133.21, Sec.  133.25, Sec.  133.42, or Sec.  133.47, for 
suspected infringement of a recorded mark or recorded copyright or 
suspected circumvention of a copyright protection measure, proposed 19 
CFR 113.70 required the owner of the recorded mark or the recorded 
copyright to furnish a single transaction bond to CBP. The bond was 
required in the amount specified by CBP and was required to contain the 
bond conditions set forth in proposed Sec.  113.70, including an 
agreement to only use the sample for the limited purpose of assisting 
CBP in enforcing IPR and an agreement to indemnify the importer or 
owner for any improper use of the sample.
1. Type of Bond
    Comment: Two commenters requested that CBP also permit the right 
holder to furnish a continuous bond. The commenters stated that 
continuous bonds are more efficient in terms of simplified tracking and 
administration, more economical, ease the burden of underwriting, 
reduce the administrative burden on CBP, and further CBP's overall 
strategy to facilitate trade. One of the commenters further noted that 
CBP has in the past allowed continuous bonds when samples of 
merchandise were sought for examination or testing.
    Response: CBP agrees with the commenters and recognizes that some 
owners of a recorded mark or recorded copyright may prefer a continuous 
bond for reasons of efficiency, economy, or underwriting. Thus, CBP is 
amending

[[Page 52366]]

the language in proposed Sec.  113.70 to permit the owner of the 
recorded mark or the recorded copyright to furnish to CBP either a 
single transaction bond or a continuous bond, in the amount specified 
by CBP and containing the conditions listed, when obtaining a sample of 
the merchandise.
2. Bond Conditions
    Comment: One commenter requested that CBP amend Sec.  113.70 to 
remove references to post-seizure disclosures or procedures. The 
commenter noted that the use of the term ``suspected'' in the heading 
and text of proposed 19 CFR 113.70, which specifically states that the 
bond conditions apply when a right holder obtains a sample of imported 
merchandise ``suspected of infringing recorded marks or recorded 
copyrights, or circumventing copyright protection measures,'' 
demonstrates that the bond conditions in Sec.  113.70 are only intended 
to apply in a pre-seizure context. Since proposed Sec.  113.70 contains 
general citations to Sec. Sec.  133.21, 133.42, and 133.47, the 
commenter noted that the bond requirement and conditions apply in a 
both pre-seizure and post-seizure context because Sec. Sec.  133.21(f), 
133.42(f), and 133.47(f) address post-seizure disclosures and 
procedures. The commenter further asserted that TFTEA does not provide 
statutory authority for imposing the Sec.  113.70 bond conditions, 
including an agreement to use the sample for the limited purpose of 
assisting CBP, in a post-seizure context because TFTEA only addresses 
CBP's authority to provide samples to right holders when doing so would 
assist CBP in determining whether the merchandise is being imported in 
violation of the IPR laws. The commenter pointed out that imported 
merchandise is only seized after this determination has been made and 
that this post-seizure context is not addressed in title III of TFTEA.
    Response: The proposed amendments to 19 CFR 113.70 were intended to 
consolidate the IPR sample bond language and conditions, currently 
contained throughout 19 CFR part 133, in one centralized location. As 
set forth in existing 19 CFR 133.21(f) and 133.42(e), CBP already 
requires an IPR sample bond in the post-seizure context, conditioned on 
indemnifying the importer or owner of the imported merchandise against 
any loss or damage resulting from the furnishing of the sample by CBP 
to the right holder. CBP endeavored to incorporate these existing post-
seizure bond requirements and conditions in proposed Sec.  113.70. 
However, CBP agrees with the commenter that, as drafted, the bond 
conditions proposed in Sec.  113.70 conflate pre-seizure and post-
seizure contexts. To avoid confusion and to clarify the bond conditions 
in a post-seizure context, CBP is amending proposed Sec.  113.70 to 
revise its heading and to add a new paragraph (b) setting forth the 
bond requirements and conditions for when CBP provides the owner of a 
recorded mark or recorded copyright a sample of imported merchandise 
seized for infringing the recorded mark or copyright, or circumventing 
a copyright protection measure, including samples provided pursuant to 
Sec.  133.21(f), Sec.  133.42(f), or Sec.  133.47(f). For additional 
clarity, CBP is also specifying in any cross-references made to Sec.  
113.70 throughout part 133 whether Sec.  113.70(a), containing the bond 
conditions for merchandise suspected of IPR violations, or Sec.  
113.70(b), containing the bond conditions for merchandise seized for 
IPR violations, is applicable.
    Comment: Two commenters expressed concern that proposed Sec.  
113.70 does not describe the types of actions that would violate the 
bond conditions, including what activities are permissible in service 
of ``providing assistance to CBP in enforcing intellectual property 
rights,'' and what actions may be deemed an ``improper use'' of the 
sample.
    Response: CBP does not believe it is necessary to amend or expand 
on the bond conditions language in Sec.  113.70(a). The specificity of 
the bond conditions in Sec.  113.70(a) is consistent with the 
specificity of the conditions for other types of CBP bonds set forth 
throughout title 19 of the CFR. Furthermore, section 302(a) of TFTEA 
states, in part, that CBP may provide the right holder with a sample of 
the merchandise suspected of violating the IPR laws if CBP determines 
that the ``examination or testing'' of the merchandise by the right 
holder would assist CBP in determining if the merchandise is being 
imported in violation of the IPR laws. In the pre-seizure context, any 
activity performed by the owner of the recorded mark or recorded 
copyright that falls outside the scope of determining the authenticity 
of the sample would constitute an improper use of the sample and would 
violate the Sec.  113.70(a) bond conditions.
    Comment: One commenter stated that the bond conditions in proposed 
Sec.  113.70, which limit the sample's use, could be construed as 
prohibiting a right holder from providing relevant information gleaned 
from its examination to law enforcement agencies other than CBP, or 
from pursuing civil enforcement of the right holder's legitimate rights 
authorized elsewhere under Federal or State law. The commenter sought 
clarification on this issue. This commenter also objected to CBP's not 
including in proposed Sec. Sec.  133.21(f), 133.42(f), and 133.47(f), 
language specifying that another use that the sample may be utilized 
for is ``in pursuit of a related private civil remedy for 
infringement,'' particularly given that this specific language is 
included in existing Sec. Sec.  133.21(f) and 133.42(e).
    Response: The bond conditions that limit the sample's use, as set 
forth in proposed Sec.  113.70, only apply in a pre-seizure context. 
Pursuant to CBP's statutory authority in section 302 of TFTEA, for 
merchandise suspected of being imported in violation of the IPR laws, 
the sample may only be used by the right holder for the limited purpose 
of providing assistance to CBP in enforcing IPR. Thus, as explained 
above, in the pre-seizure context, any activity performed or disclosure 
made by the right holder that falls outside the scope of determining 
the authenticity of the sample would constitute an improper use of the 
sample and violate the Sec.  113.70(a) bond conditions. This 
restriction is necessary since, at the time that CBP is furnishing the 
sample to the right holder, the imported merchandise is only suspected 
of IPR infringement or circumvention and therefore, it would be 
inappropriate for the right holder to provide information gleaned from 
its examination of the sample to law enforcement agencies other than 
CBP, or from pursuing civil enforcement under Federal or State law.
    However, a right holder may use a sample obtained after the 
merchandise is seized for violations of the IPR laws for purposes other 
than assisting CBP. To provide clarification on this issue, CBP is 
adding a new paragraph (b) to Sec.  113.70 to provide less restrictive 
bond conditions in the post-seizure context, including those related to 
other uses such as a civil remedy for infringement. CBP is also 
amending the post-seizure disclosure provisions in Sec. Sec.  
133.21(f), 133.42(f), and 133.47(f), as requested by the commenter, to 
explicitly state that samples released by CBP post-seizure may be used 
in pursuit of a related private civil remedy for infringement.
3. Amount of the Bond
    Comment: Two commenters asserted that there is a lack of clarity 
regarding the amount of the bond because the proposed language in Sec.  
113.70 and part 133 states that the bond will be in the ``amount 
specified by CBP.'' One of the commenters stated that this broad 
language appears to allow bond valuations based on highly speculative 
claims of loss or damage, which the

[[Page 52367]]

commenter believes would discourage right holders from requesting 
samples. This commenter recommended that the bond be formulated only on 
provable harm that may arise from the importer's loss of the physical 
sample and that, for any indirect injury because of misuse of the 
sample, the importer should seek recourse in the courts, not with CBP. 
The other commenter sought clarity on the amount of the bond and 
whether the bond amounts would remain at the current levels, which the 
commenter stated are set at the value of the sample (typically $100), 
to secure the importer from any damage to the sample while in 
possession of the right holder, or if the bond amounts would 
dramatically increase due to the bond's now securing against any loss 
or damage resulting from improper use of the sample. This commenter 
also requested information on the range of criteria appropriate for 
setting bond amounts.
    Response: CBP disagrees that there is a lack of clarity regarding 
the amount of the bond. CBP will specify the amount of the bond based 
on the same standard CBP bond requirements and parameters that CBP uses 
to determine the amount of its other bonds, as set forth in Sec.  
113.13. Section 113.13 governs the amount of any CBP bond, unless 
expressly exempt by law or other regulation, including setting the 
minimum amount of the bond, providing guidelines for determining the 
amount of the bond, requiring periodic review of the bond sufficiency, 
and providing CBP authority to require additional security if CBP 
determines the bond is not sufficient. In accordance with Sec.  
113.13(a), while the minimum amount of an IPR sample bond is $100, as 
noted by the commenter, the bond amount assessment is based on the 
domestic value of the sample, or $100, whichever is greater. This 
determination has been the long-standing policy of CBP when setting 
bond amounts in the post-seizure context. Regarding the criteria for 
setting pre-seizure bond amounts, CBP takes the particular 
circumstances of each situation into account when making its 
determination using the guidelines set forth in Sec.  113.13(b). 
Numerous factors, including but not limited to, the nature of the 
merchandise at issue, the value of the merchandise, including the size 
of the shipment, and CBP's prior dealings with the principal will 
inform CBP's decision in setting the bond amount. It is essential to 
CBP's operations that CBP be able to retain flexibility in establishing 
the appropriate bond amount.
4. Bond Return Requirements
    Comment: One commenter requested that CBP revise proposed Sec.  
113.70 to clarify that the bond will be returned when the imported 
merchandise at issue is determined to violate the right holder's IPR. 
This commenter stated that while the existing Sec.  113.70 makes clear 
that the right holder's bond will be returned where the goods at issue 
are ultimately determined to violate the right holder's IPR, the 
proposed Sec.  113.70 does not contain similar language. The commenter 
stated that, as drafted, the proposed regulations could lead to the 
forfeiture of the bond even when CBP determines that the goods were 
counterfeit or piratical.
    Response: CBP disagrees with this commenter's suggestion. The 
commenter's bond description and stated concerns are addressing a bond 
required to pursue a disputed determination of copyright infringement 
that is in the existing regulations in Sec. Sec.  113.70, 133.43, and 
133.44, not the IPR sample bond that is contained in proposed Sec.  
113.70. The existing regulations require the right holder to furnish a 
bond under Sec.  133.43(d)(1) to pursue a copyright infringement 
determination. Existing Sec.  113.70 is currently a bond to indemnify 
the United States if CBP detains any articles alleged by the principal 
to be a piratical copy of material covered by the principal's copyright 
pending a final determination and to hold the United States harmless 
from any material depreciation, loss, or damage to the articles if it 
is determined that the goods are not piratical. Section 133.44(a) 
states that this bond will be returned to the right holder if the 
articles at issue are ultimately determined to violate the right 
holder's IPR. However, as explained in the NPRM, CBP believes that 
these procedures, including the bond, are an outdated and inefficient 
mechanism to address situations where CBP has a suspicion that certain 
goods may be piratical, therefore, CBP is removing Sec. Sec.  133.43 
and 133.44 in their entirety from title 19 of the CFR. Additionally, as 
noted in the NPRM, because CBP is removing Sec. Sec.  133.43 and 
133.44, CBP is revising the related provision in Sec.  113.70, which 
currently sets forth the bond conditions for detention of copyrighted 
material. CBP is revising Sec.  113.70, as proposed in the NPRM and 
finalized in this rule, to set forth, in one centralized location, the 
bond conditions for a right holder to obtain samples of imported 
merchandise suspected of infringing the right holder's IPR.
    If the conditions of the IPR sample bond, as provided for in 
revised Sec.  113.70(a)(1), are violated, CBP may make a demand on the 
bond, even if CBP ultimately determines that the imported merchandise 
violates the right holder's IPR. To clarify the IPR sample bond 
conditions, particularly with regard to the timing of the sample return 
requirements and to ensure that a bond is not incorrectly forfeited, 
CBP is amending the language proposed in Sec.  113.70. As discussed 
above, proposed Sec.  113.70 is being revised to address the pre-
seizure context in paragraph (a) and the post-seizure context in 
paragraph (b). In the pre-seizure context, CBP is revising the language 
proposed to state that the sample must be returned upon demand by CBP 
or at the conclusion of any examination, testing, or similar procedure 
performed on the sample, whichever occurs sooner. In the post-seizure 
context, CBP is adding language to state that the sample must be 
returned upon demand by CBP or at the conclusion of any examination, 
testing, or other use, whichever occurs sooner.
    If the sample, in either a pre-seizure or post-seizure context, is 
not returned to CBP by the right holder, the IPR sample bond is 
forfeited regardless of whether the merchandise is determined to 
violate IPR.

B. Definitions

1. Piratical Articles
    Comment: One commenter stated that the proposed language added to 
the definition of ``piratical article'' in Sec.  133.42(a), which 
states that the copy or phonorecord must be ``of a recorded copyright 
work, importation of which is prohibited by the Copyright Act of 
1976,'' is too narrowly tailored. The commenter asserted that CBP 
enforces copyrights at the border so long as the work is registered 
with the U.S. Copyright Office and that the proposed definition seems 
to exclude works not recorded with CBP.
    Response: CBP disagrees that ``piratical articles'' is too narrowly 
defined. Section 302 of TFTEA (19 U.S.C. 1628a(c)) explicitly limits 
its authority to apply only to merchandise suspected of infringing a 
trademark or copyright that is recorded with CBP. Accordingly, works 
not recorded with CBP are excluded from the procedures set forth in 
Sec.  133.42.
2. Copyright Protection Measure
    Comment: Two commenters requested that CBP revise the definition of 
``copyright protection measure'' in proposed Sec.  133.47(a)(1) to 
include copy controls. Copy controls, as set forth in

[[Page 52368]]

17 U.S.C. 1201(b)(1), prohibit the importation of technologies, 
products, or services that circumvent a technological protection 
measure that effectively protects the exclusive rights of a copyright 
owner. The commenters asserted that the proposed definition, as 
drafted, only applies to the seizure and forfeiture of imported 
merchandise that circumvents access controls, as set forth in 17 U.S.C. 
1201(a)(2), prohibiting the importation of technologies, products, or 
services that circumvent a technological protection measure that 
effectively controls access to a copyrighted work. They stated that to 
ensure that CBP fully implements TFTEA and to ensure effective border 
enforcement against all unlawfully imported circumvention devices, the 
definition of ``copyright protection measure'' in Sec.  133.47(a)(1) 
must also include copy controls. The commenters noted that Congress 
enacted section 303 of TFTEA to explicitly authorize CBP to seize and 
forfeit merchandise that is prohibited under both 17 U.S.C. 1201(a)(2) 
and 1201(b)(1). Both commenters provided language that they requested 
CBP use to amend the definition of ``copyright protection measure.''
    Response: CBP agrees that the definition of ``copyright protection 
measure'' in Sec.  133.47(a)(1) should include copy controls. Section 
303(a) of TFTEA amended section 596(c)(2) of the Tariff Act of 1930 (19 
U.S.C. 1595a(c)(2)) by adding a new subparagraph (G), which states that 
the merchandise may be seized and forfeited if CBP determines it is a 
technology, product, service, device, component, or part whose 
importation is prohibited under 17 U.S.C. 1201(a)(2) or (b)(1). Since 
copy controls are set forth in 17 U.S.C. 1201(b)(1), CBP is amending 
the definition of ``copyright protection measure'' to include copy 
controls. While the language the two commenters suggested differs in 
form, it is substantially similar, therefore, CBP is adopting the more 
concise language suggested and is adding ``or effectively protects a 
right of a copyright owner in,'' to the definition of ``copyright 
protection measure'' in Sec.  133.47(a)(1).

C. Pre-Seizure Disclosures to Right Holders

1. Limited Importation Information Disclosures
    From the time merchandise is presented for examination, CBP may 
disclose to the right holder certain limited importation information, 
as listed in proposed Sec. Sec.  133.21(b)(4), 133.42(b)(4), and 
133.47(b)(4), to obtain assistance in determining whether the 
merchandise is being imported in violation of the IPR laws.
    Comment: One commenter noted that the proposed amendments to 
Sec. Sec.  133.21(b)(4), 133.42(b)(4), and 133.47(b)(4) shifted CBP's 
disclosure of limited importation information to the right holder from 
a mandatory disclosure (``CBP will release the information'') to a 
permissive disclosure (``CBP may release the information''). The 
commenter requested that CBP revert to a mandatory disclosure using the 
language ``CBP will release the information,'' as required in the 
existing CBP regulations at 19 CFR 133.21(b)(4).
    Response: CBP disagrees with the commenter's suggestion. CBP 
believes that the limited information disclosures provided for in 
Sec. Sec.  133.21(b)(4), 133.42(b)(4), and 133.47(b)(4) should remain, 
as proposed, permissive. Based on CBP's experience and right holders' 
feedback, the disclosure of limited importation information at this 
stage of the determination process does not provide a significant 
benefit. The limited importation information that CBP may disclose only 
includes the date of importation, the port of entry, description and 
quantity of the imported merchandise, and the country of origin. While 
this data may have been beneficial in the past when supply chains were 
less complex, the current reality of multi-faceted and global supply 
chains limits the value of this limited importation information. In 
today's trade environment, supply chains often involve multiple 
countries of origin, possible transshipment, as well as used, 
refurbished, or gray market merchandise. The comprehensive importation 
information disclosure provided to the right holder post-seizure in 
Sec. Sec.  133.21(e), 133.42(e), and 133.47(e) is of significantly 
greater value and benefit. As such, CBP has determined that it is a 
better use of CBP resources, and of greater value to right holders, to 
provide more information later in the process, when appropriate, as 
opposed to less information sooner in the process, when it may not be 
as useful to the right holder and when the information disclosure 
requires significant expenditure of CBP resources.
    Comment: A commenter stated that, as drafted, proposed Sec.  
133.21(b)(4) is silent regarding CBP's ability to disclose the limited 
importation information in a scenario where the information was not 
disclosed prior to the issuance of the notice of detention and the 
information is available at the time the notice of detention is issued. 
In the existing CBP regulations, Sec.  133.21(b)(4) describes this 
scenario and states that where CBP does not disclose this information 
to the right holder prior to issuance of the notice of detention, CBP 
will do so concurrently with the issuance of the notice of detention. 
However, the commenter pointed out that proposed Sec.  133.21(b)(4) 
only describes a scenario where the information is unavailable at the 
time the notice of detention is issued.
    Response: CBP agrees that proposed Sec.  133.21(b)(4), as well as 
proposed Sec. Sec.  133.42(b)(4), and 133.47(b)(4), do not contain all 
the scenarios under which CBP may choose to disclose the limited 
importation information to the right holder. Please note that while 
Sec. Sec.  133.21(b)(2)(i)(A), 133.42(b)(2)(i)(A), and 
133.47(b)(2)(i)(A) address the scenario where CBP may have previously 
disclosed the information prior to the issuance of the notice of 
detention or where CBP may disclose the information no later than the 
date of issuance of the notice of detention, these regulatory sections' 
intended purpose is to provide notice to the importer of the possible 
disclosure of its information and not to provide CBP authority to 
disclose this information to the right holders. Accordingly, CBP is 
amending the language proposed in Sec. Sec.  133.21(b)(4), 
133.42(b)(4), and 133.47(b)(4) to address all the circumstances where 
CBP may permissively disclose the limited importation information, 
including that CBP may release such information prior to the issuance 
of the notice of detention, concurrently with the notice of detention, 
or, if the information is unavailable at the time the notice of 
detention is issued, CBP may release the information after issuance of 
the notice of detention.
    CBP also notes that there is an inadvertent inconsistency between 
the third sentence in proposed Sec.  133.21(b)(4) and the third 
sentence in proposed Sec. Sec.  133.42(b)(4) and 133.47(b)(4). 
Specifically, CBP inadvertently did not propose to amend the third 
sentence of Sec.  133.21(b)(4) in the NPRM, thereby leaving the 
regulatory language unchanged, which provides for a mandatory 
disclosure. To correct this error, CBP is amending the third sentence 
of Sec.  133.21(b)(4) to state that CBP may permissively disclose the 
listed information. This amendment will correct the inadvertent error, 
align the third sentence of this paragraph with the permissive 
information disclosure proposed in the NPRM for the remainder of 
proposed Sec.  133.21(b)(4), and ensure that the same permissive 
information disclosure is used for disclosures to owners of a recorded 
mark (Sec.  133.21), owners of a

[[Page 52369]]

recorded copyright (Sec.  133.42), and owners of a recorded copyright, 
who employ a copyright protection measure that may have been 
circumvented or attempted to be circumvented by articles that violate 
the importation prohibitions of the DMCA (eligible persons in Sec.  
133.47).
    Comment: A commenter also pointed out that there is a conflict 
between proposed Sec.  133.21(b)(4), which contains a permissive 
information disclosure, and existing Sec.  133.21(b)(2)(i)(A), which 
CBP did not propose to amend in the NPRM and contains a mandatory 
information disclosure.
    Response: CBP agrees with the commenter. The commenter has 
correctly pointed out an inconsistency between proposed Sec.  
133.21(b)(4) and existing Sec.  133.21(b)(2)(i)(A). Without a 
regulatory amendment, Sec.  133.21(b)(2)(i)(A) would require CBP to 
provide notice to the importer that CBP has, or will, perform a 
mandatory information disclosure to the right holder of the same 
limited importation information that CBP has the authority to choose to 
disclose or to not disclose as needed, per proposed Sec.  133.21(b)(4). 
This inconsistency was inadvertent and also created an inconsistency 
between existing Sec.  133.21(b)(2)(i)(A) and the proposed Sec. Sec.  
133.42(b)(2)(i)(A) and 133.47(b)(2)(i)(A), which were intended to be 
parallel provisions to ensure the same treatment. Accordingly, CBP is 
amending Sec.  133.21(b)(2)(i)(A) to reflect the language used in 
Sec. Sec.  133.42(b)(2)(i)(A) and 133.47(b)(2)(i)(A) and changing Sec.  
133.21(b)(2)(i)(A) from an unintended mandatory disclosure to an 
intended permissive disclosure. This amendment makes the CBP 
regulations consistent across contexts and provides clarity on the 
issue raised by the commenter.
    Comment: A commenter requested that CBP amend Sec.  133.42(b)(4) to 
add additional disclosures to the limited importation information that 
CBP may disclose to the owner of the recorded copyright to obtain 
assistance in determining whether an imported article is a piratical 
article. The commenter suggested that CBP also provide the owner of the 
recorded copyright with the origin of the shipment, including the 
sender and the owner of the merchandise, and the destination of the 
shipment, in order to assist the owner in identifying entities engaged 
in counterfeiting and trace the origin of the infringing goods.
    Response: CBP disagrees with the commenter's suggestion. CBP may 
disclose limited importation information when CBP believes that the 
right holder may assist CBP in determining whether the article is a 
piratical article. When CBP seeks authentication assistance from the 
right holder under Sec.  133.42(b)(4), CBP is seeking information about 
the article itself, namely, whether the physical characteristics of the 
article indicate authenticity or inauthenticity. Given the complexity 
of supply chains and the legitimate trade of gray market and used 
goods, CBP notes that information concerning the sender and the 
recipient of the shipment should not form the basis of an authenticity 
determination by the right holder. Also, as explained above, in today's 
current global supply chain environment, this importation information 
is of limited value to the right holder. Additionally, the information 
that the commenter requested is disclosed to the owner of the recorded 
copyright post-seizure pursuant to Sec.  133.42(e).
2. Unredacted Disclosures
    Comment: One commenter stated that the language ``if CBP concludes 
that the disclosure would assist CBP in its determination'' in proposed 
Sec. Sec.  133.21(b)(2)(ii) and (b)(3), 133.42(b)(2)(ii) and (b)(3), 
and 133.47(b)(2)(ii) and (b)(3) is ambiguous and recommended that CBP 
amend the regulatory language to create a presumption that the 
disclosure would assist CBP in its IPR enforcement mission. The 
commenter stated that after CBP provides notice of detention to the 
importer of CBP's suspicion that the goods are counterfeit or 
piratical, there are only two possible scenarios: the importer either 
fails to respond entirely or the importer provides additional 
information to CBP that might be considered when CBP makes its 
determination. The commenter asserted that, under both possible 
scenarios, the right holder's examination of the merchandise would 
greatly assist CBP in its determination and that a presumption that the 
information disclosure would assist CBP in its determination is 
warranted.
    Response: CBP disagrees. CBP does not have the statutory authority 
for such a presumption, which would require CBP to abdicate its role in 
making a determination as to the information disclosure's utility, in 
direct conflict with title III of TFTEA. Section 302(a) of TFTEA 
explicitly restricts CBP's ability to provide unredacted information 
disclosures and samples to situations in which CBP determines that the 
examination or testing of the merchandise by the right holder would 
assist CBP in determining whether the imported merchandise is in 
violation of the IPR laws. The language in Sec. Sec.  133.21(b)(2)(ii) 
and (b)(3), 133.42(b)(2)(ii) and (b)(3), and 133.47(b)(2)(ii) and 
(b)(3) mirrors this statutory language.
3. Conditions of Unredacted Disclosures
    Pursuant to existing Sec.  133.21(c)(1), proposed Sec.  
133.42(c)(1), and proposed Sec.  133.47(c)(1), when CBP discloses 
information prior to seizure, CBP will notify the right holder that 
some or all of the information being released may be subject to the 
protections of the Trade Secrets Act, and that CBP is only disclosing 
the information for the purpose of assisting CBP in determining whether 
the merchandise bears a counterfeit mark for purposes of existing Sec.  
133.21(c)(1), in determining whether the merchandise is a piratical 
article for purposes of proposed Sec.  133.42(c)(1), or in determining 
whether the merchandise violates the DMCA for purposes of proposed 
Sec.  133.47(c)(1).
    Comment: One commenter requested that CBP remove the references to 
the Trade Secrets Act in existing Sec.  133.21(c)(1), proposed Sec.  
133.42(c)(1), and proposed Sec.  133.47(c)(1), which set forth the 
conditions of disclosure for unredacted information and samples. The 
commenter provided two reasons for the requested removal of references 
to the Trade Secrets Act. Firstly, the commenter noted that the Trade 
Secrets Act only prohibits the unauthorized disclosure of information 
and the inclusion of the reference to the Trade Secrets Act is 
unnecessary because TFTEA specifically authorizes the disclosure of 
this information. Secondly, the commenter stated that the inclusion of 
the Trade Secrets Act reference could be construed as implying a threat 
of legal liability if the right holder uses the information disclosed 
for any purpose other than assisting CBP in the stated purpose, and the 
commenter asserted that the Trade Secrets Act does not restrict the 
subsequent use of the disclosed information by a third party.
    Response: CBP disagrees and does not believe that the references to 
the Trade Secrets Act should be removed from Sec. Sec.  133.21(c)(1), 
133.42(c)(1), and 133.47(c)(1). Title III of TFTEA only authorizes 
disclosures in a pre-seizure context for a specific purpose, which is 
assisting CBP in making the relevant determination of whether the 
imported merchandise violates the IPR laws. Using the disclosed 
information in the pre-seizure context beyond the scope of what is 
authorized by TFTEA is impermissible and the references to the Trade 
Secrets Act in these sections provide notice to the right holder of the 
limited permissible use.

[[Page 52370]]

D. Notice of Detention and Importer Response Process

    Pursuant to existing and proposed Sec. Sec.  133.21(b), 133.42(b), 
and 133.47(b), CBP must notify the importer via a notice of detention 
that the importer's merchandise was detained and that the importer has 
seven business days from the notification to establish that the 
merchandise does not violate the IPR laws. Prior to and during those 
seven business days, CBP may only provide the limited importation 
information set forth in Sec. Sec.  133.21(b)(4), 133.42(b)(4), and 
133.47(b)(4) or the redacted photographs, images, or samples described 
in Sec. Sec.  133.21(b)(5), 133.42(b)(5), and 133.47(b)(5) to the right 
holder. In accordance with Sec. Sec.  133.21(b)(2)(ii), 
133.42(b)(2)(ii), and 133.47(b)(2)(ii), CBP may disclose to the right 
holder information that appears on the detained merchandise and/or its 
retail packaging, including unredacted photographs, images, or samples, 
if the importer fails to respond within those seven business days or 
provides insufficient information to demonstrate that the merchandise 
does not violate the IPR laws.
    Comment: One commenter recommended that CBP reassess the current 
bifurcated disclosure process in 19 CFR part 133. The commenter 
requested that CBP remove the seven-business-day response period 
process throughout 19 CFR part 133 because the commenter believes that 
this process has been overturned by the passage of title III of TFTEA 
and other actions taken by the government and that this process serves 
to impede efficient enforcement while failing to advance any legitimate 
interests of importers.
    Response: CBP disagrees with the commenter. CBP has not observed 
any impediment to its enforcement efforts. The process of providing the 
importer with a notice of detention and a seven-business-day response 
period safeguards the importer's information from unnecessary 
disclosures. The Trade Secrets Act protects those required to furnish 
commercial or financial information to the government by shielding them 
from the competitive disadvantage that could result from disclosure of 
that information by the government, including importers whose 
merchandise is suspected of violating the IPR laws. These importers 
must be afforded due process to dispute this suspicion and provide 
information within the seven-business-day response period to prove that 
their detained merchandise is not violative before CBP discloses 
unredacted information and samples to the right holder. The Trade 
Secrets Act permits those covered by the Act to disclose protected 
information when the disclosure is otherwise ``authorized by law'' 
which includes both statutes expressly authorizing disclosure and 
properly promulgated regulations authorizing disclosure based on a 
valid statutory interpretation. See Chrysler v. Brown, 441 U.S. 281, 
294-316 (1979). Section 302 of TFTEA expressly authorizes disclosure of 
unredacted images and samples of the merchandise in a pre-seizure 
context only when such a disclosure would assist CBP in making a 
determination of the authenticity of the merchandise. To make such a 
determination, CBP requires the seven-business-day response period to 
appropriately assess the information available to CBP and decide 
whether an unredacted disclosure to the right holder would assist CBP 
in its authenticity determination.

E. Post-Seizure Disclosures to Persons Injured by Violations of the 
DMCA

    Comment: Two commenters noted that proposed Sec.  133.47(b)(2)(iii) 
states that eligible persons may apply to receive post-seizure 
disclosures from CBP when injured by violations of the DMCA by 
attaching a letter requesting such disclosures to an application to 
record a copyright. The commenters expressed concern that, as drafted, 
the proposed regulatory language appears to apply only prospectively. 
They stated that this raises concerns about the status of copyright 
registrations previously recorded with CBP and questioned whether CBP 
intended for copyrights to be recorded again in order for the right 
holder to qualify as an eligible person (and therefore, an injured 
person) for purposes of post-seizure disclosures. One commenter 
requested that CBP add language to Sec.  133.47(b)(2)(iii) allowing 
owners of previously recorded copyrights to similarly apply for 
protection by submitting a letter requesting such disclosures and also 
requested that CBP permit a letter to be submitted during a request for 
renewal of an existing recordation.
    Response: CBP agrees that Sec.  133.47(b)(2)(iii) should not be 
restricted to those right holders recording new copyrights and that 
owners of current copyright recordations should not be required to re-
record their works in order to receive such post-seizure disclosures 
and be placed on the injured persons list. CBP is amending the language 
proposed in Sec.  133.47(b)(2)(iii) to allow owners of currently 
recorded copyrights to apply for protection by submitting a letter to 
CBP requesting post-seizure disclosures at any time, as long as there 
is a current relevant recordation with CBP. The application process is 
described further in section I.C. of the Background discussion above. 
CBP is also amending Sec.  133.47(b)(2)(iii) by allowing owners of 
recorded copyrights to apply for DMCA protections by attaching the 
letter to a request to renew the copyright recordation. CBP reiterates 
that to qualify as an eligible person, as defined in Sec.  
133.47(a)(3), who may apply to CBP to receive DMCA protections, as set 
forth in Sec.  133.47(b)(2)(iii), that person must have a recorded 
copyright with CBP upon which the person can claim a harm that the 
injured status might redress.

III. Technical Corrections

    In addition to the modifications explained above, CBP is amending 
Sec. Sec.  133.21(c)(2), 133.42(c)(2), and 133.47(c)(2) to remove the 
corresponding cross-references to paragraph (b)(2)(ii). Paragraph 
(b)(2)(ii) provides the importer notice that its information may be 
disclosed to the right holder if the importer fails to respond to the 
notice of detention in paragraph (b)(2)(i) within the seven-business-
day response period or if the importer provides an insufficient 
response to the notice. Thus, it is inaccurate to cite to paragraph 
(b)(2)(ii) in paragraph (c)(2) as authority for CBP's releasing the 
unredacted sample. CBP is releasing the unredacted sample pursuant to 
the regulatory authority in paragraph (b)(3) only. Accordingly, CBP is 
removing the citation to paragraph (b)(2)(ii) in paragraph (c)(2) and 
is only citing to the appropriate cross-reference of paragraph (b)(3).
    Additionally, CBP is adding the language ``if practicable'' after 
``entry after obliteration of the recorded copyright'' in Sec.  
133.42(g) to clarify that a recorded copyright may only be obliterated 
in some circumstances. It may not be possible for the importer to 
obliterate or remove a recorded copyright from the seized merchandise 
in all circumstances, for example, when the article itself consists of 
a piratical copy. In Sec.  133.47(g), CBP is removing ``entry after 
obliteration of the recorded copyright'' as an option entirely since 
obliterating the recorded copyright is not an appropriate disposition 
for articles that violate the DMCA because the article itself consists 
of the article that violates the DMCA.
    In this document, CBP is also correcting the authority section for 
part 113, adding additional cross-references for clarification 
purposes, and correcting several cross-references in Sec.  133.47 that 
inadvertently cited to the

[[Page 52371]]

definition for ``copyright protection measure'' (Sec.  133.47(a)(1)) 
instead of the definition of ``articles that violate the DMCA'' (Sec.  
133.47(a)(2)) when referencing articles that are suspected of violating 
the DMCA.

IV. Conclusion

    After careful consideration of the public comments received, for 
the reasons stated above, as well as the reasons outlined in the NPRM, 
CBP is adopting as final the NPRM published in the Federal Register on 
October 16, 2019 (84 FR 55251), with the changes described above.

V. Statutory and Regulatory Requirements

A. Executive Orders 12866 and 13563

    Executive Orders 12866 (``Regulatory Planning and Review'') and 
13563 (``Improving Regulation and Regulatory Review'') direct agencies 
to assess the costs and benefits of available regulatory alternatives 
and, if regulation is necessary, to select regulatory approaches that 
maximize net benefits (including potential economic, environmental, 
public health and safety effects, distributive impacts, and equity). 
Executive Order 13563 emphasizes the importance of quantifying both 
costs and benefits, of reducing costs, of harmonizing rules, and of 
promoting flexibility. This rule is a significant regulatory action 
under section 3(f) of Executive Order 12866. Accordingly, OMB has 
reviewed this regulation.
    One of CBP's roles is to safeguard the U.S. economy from the 
importation of goods that violate intellectual property rights. Under 
existing regulations, if CBP suspects that a shipment may be violative, 
it can share redacted information and samples of the suspect imported 
merchandise with a right holder.\1\ To implement title III of TFTEA's 
IPR provisions, this final rule will, among other things, allow CBP to 
disclose unredacted information and share unredacted images and samples 
of suspect imports with right holders, if examination by right holders 
would assist CBP's determination and provided that these disclosures 
would not compromise an ongoing law enforcement investigation or 
national security.
---------------------------------------------------------------------------

    \1\ Note that this rule does not alter CBP's ability to provide 
redacted samples of an import to a right holder without prior 
notification to the importer.
---------------------------------------------------------------------------

    Disclosing this unredacted information and sharing these unredacted 
samples and images with right holders may provide access to information 
about the importer protected by the Trade Secrets Act (18 U.S.C. 1905). 
This final rule establishes a procedure under which, following notice 
to the importer, the importer has seven business days to establish to 
CBP that the suspect imports are not violative of the IPR laws, and are 
instead admissible. If the importer is unable to demonstrate the 
admissibility of its imports within this timeframe, CBP will share 
information with the right holder by disclosing the information or 
releasing unredacted samples of the imports in question.
    As CBP is establishing a new process for copyrights, it does not 
have data on the number of times CBP suspects shipments are violative 
of the copyright laws or piratical articles. However, on September 24, 
2012, CBP published an interim final rule in the Federal Register (77 
FR 24375) that established similar procedures for trademarks. For 
analytical purposes, CBP can assume that this final rule has similar 
effects after adjusting for the differing volumes. CBP subject matter 
experts estimate that CBP sends out an average of 824 detention letters 
every fiscal year for suspected trademark infringements. Based on the 
proportion of live trademark recordations \2\ available to support the 
agency's IPR seizures every fiscal year, relative to the copyright 
recordations, CBP estimates an average of approximately 21,423 seizures 
based on trademark, 8,881 based on copyright, and 116 DMCA seizures. If 
the number of detention letters is proportional to the number of 
seizures, CBP estimates that this final rule will result in 345 more 
detention letters for possible copyright-infringing importations. 
Similarly, by using the number of seizures related to DMCA as a 
proportion of total trademark seizures, CBP estimates that this final 
rule will result in four detention letters for possible DMCA-infringing 
importations.
---------------------------------------------------------------------------

    \2\ Source: CBP's IPRiS database. Sampling methodology averaged 
five equally spaced dates in every fiscal year to estimate the IPRiS 
live recordations available for IPR seizures (95% CI, p = 0.05) 
annually. CBP took several sample counts per year as opposed to a 
single annual count to ensure a representative measure as IPRiS 
recordations enter and expire throughout the year.
---------------------------------------------------------------------------

    CBP estimates that the procedure to demonstrate that the imports 
are not piratical will take two hours per affected importer at a cost 
of $34.81 per hour.\3\ \4\ This is based on the existing information 
collection for the Notice of Detention (OMB Control Number 1651-0073), 
which is being updated for this rulemaking. CBP estimates that 
importers will bear an opportunity cost as a result of the higher 
number of detention notices caused by this rule. CBP estimates that 
this opportunity cost will total $24,019 (345 * 2 * $34.81) for 
copyright detentions and $278 (4 * 2 * $34.81) for DMCA detentions for 
a total monetized cost of $24,297. CBP received no comments from the 
public regarding the estimated time cost to importers of two hours to 
respond.

implicit price deflator, published by the Bureau of Economic 
Analysis.
---------------------------------------------------------------------------

    This final rule will also formalize the existing practices used to 
enforce the DMCA. In 1998, Congress enacted the DMCA. The DMCA 
prohibits the importation of devices used to circumvent the copyright 
protection measures copyright owners use to protect their works. 
Although current regulations do not specifically provide for detention 
and seizure of articles that constitute violations of the DMCA, CBP has 
enforced the DMCA by providing CBP personnel with internal enforcement 
guidelines and advice on how to enforce DMCA violations. CBP subject 
matter experts estimate that there are approximately 116 DMCA seizures. 
It is possible that this final rule will result in a small increase in 
DMCA seizures. TFTEA requires CBP to formalize the foregoing processes 
with respect to the DMCA. The formalization of these existing practices 
in regulations does not change current practice, so this provision will 
not have additional impacts if this rule is finalized.
    In addition to the release of unredacted samples, this final rule 
will amend the detention procedures applicable to imported articles 
that are suspected of being a piratical copy or phonorecord of a 
copyrighted work. The current detention procedures in the

[[Page 52372]]

regulations allow up to 120 days for an importer or right holder of a 
suspect article to provide CBP with evidence, briefs, or other 
pertinent information to substantiate a claim or denial of 
infringement, prior to CBP's issuance of an admissibility 
determination. To expedite this process, this final rule will amend the 
regulations to require the agency to render an admissibility decision 
within 30 days from the date the articles are presented to CBP for 
examination. As the current detention procedures are seldom used, 
according to CBP subject matter experts, CBP does not believe this 
final rule will impose a significant effect on the public. During the 
public comment period, no comments were received regarding this 
statement.

B. The Regulatory Flexibility Act

    The Regulatory Flexibility Act (5 U.S.C. 601 et. seq.) (RFA), as 
amended by the Small Business Regulatory Enforcement and Fairness Act 
of 1996, requires agencies to assess the impact of regulations on small 
entities. A small entity may be a small business (defined as any 
independently owned and operated business not dominant in its field 
that qualifies as a small business per the Small Business Act); a small 
not-for-profit organization; or a small governmental jurisdiction 
(locality with fewer than 50,000 people). Section 604 of the RFA 
requires an agency to perform a regulatory flexibility analysis for a 
rule unless the agency certifies under section 605(b) that the 
regulatory action would not have a significant economic impact on a 
substantial number of small entities.
    As described in the Executive Orders 12866 and 13563 analysis 
above, CBP estimates that this final rule will result in the issuance 
of 345 additional notices of detention. CBP's current examination 
policies, use of shared enforcement systems, and targeting criteria 
that take into account previous examinations when determining risk make 
it unlikely that an importer who receives a notice of detention with 
this rule will be required to repeatedly prove the admissibility of its 
imports.\5\ As such, CBP assumes for the purposes of this analysis that 
the number of affected importers from this final rule will be equal to 
the number of additional detention notices resulting from this final 
rule--345--with each importer receiving only one detention notice. To 
the extent that an importer must prove the admissibility of its imports 
more than once as a result of this rule, the number of importers 
affected by this final rule would be lower and the cost of this final 
rule per affected importer would be higher. During the public comment 
period, no comments were received regarding this assumption.
---------------------------------------------------------------------------

    \5\ CBP reserves the right to detain any imported merchandise, 
even if an importer has previously shown that its merchandise is 
admissible. This will depend on the particulars of the importation. 
Previous importations are taken into account in the risk profile, so 
having proven the authenticity of an importation in the past makes 
it less likely that an importer will receive a Notice of Detention 
for subsequent importations.
---------------------------------------------------------------------------

    These importers are not centered in any particular industry; any 
importer of goods covered by a recorded copyright may be affected by 
this rule if CBP has a reason to believe the importer's merchandise may 
constitute a piratical copy and CBP cannot determine if an import is a 
piratical copy or prohibited circumvention device without the use of 
the provisions of this rule. CBP has conducted a study of importers to 
determine how many are small entities and has concluded that the vast 
majority (about 91 percent) of importers are small entities.\6\ 
Therefore, CBP believes this final rule may affect a substantial number 
of small entities.
---------------------------------------------------------------------------

    \6\ See ``CBP Analysis of Small Importers,'' April 2022. 
Available in the docket of this rulemaking.
---------------------------------------------------------------------------

    Although the final rule may affect a substantial number of small 
entities, CBP believes the economic impact would not be significant. As 
described in the Executive Orders 12866 and 13563 section of this 
document, CBP estimates that it takes an importer two hours to provide 
proof of the admissibility of an import to CBP. CBP estimates the 
average wage of an importer is $34.81 per hour. Thus, CBP estimates it 
will cost a small entity $69.62 to prove the admissibility of its 
import with this final rule. CBP does not believe $69.62 constitutes a 
significant economic impact.
    CBP recognizes that repeated inquiries into the admissibility of an 
importer's imports could eventually rise to the level of a significant 
economic impact. However, it is unlikely that importers will be 
repeatedly required to prove the admissibility of their imports, as 
previously mentioned. Additionally, CBP does not anticipate law-abiding 
importers to be subject to the provisions in this rule on a repeated 
basis. Once CBP has determined the admissibility of an importation, it 
will record that information in the system so it can be viewed by CBP 
import specialists on future importations and successful previous 
importations are a favorable factor in the importation's risk profile. 
Further, CBP notes that providing this information to CBP is optional 
on the part of the importer, although not providing admissibility 
information to CBP may result in the goods being seized. Therefore, CBP 
believes there will not be a significant economic impact on small 
entities.
    Accordingly, although this final rule may have an effect on a 
substantial number of small entities, as discussed above, CBP believes 
that an estimated cost of $69.62 to an importer does not constitute a 
significant economic impact. Thus, CBP certifies this regulation would 
not have a significant economic impact on a substantial number of small 
entities.

C. Paperwork Reduction Act

    In accordance with the Paperwork Reduction Act of 1995 (44 U.S.C. 
3507), the collections of information for this document are included in 
an existing collection for Notices of Detention (OMB control number 
1651-0073). An agency may not conduct, and a person is not required to 
respond to, a collection of information unless the collection of 
information displays a valid control number assigned by OMB. The burden 
hours related to the Notice of Detention for OMB control number 1651-
0073 are as follows:
    Number of Respondents: 1,695.
    Number of Responses: 1.
    Time per Response: 2 hours.
    Total Annual Burden Hours: 3,390.
    Because CBP estimates that the availability of the procedures in 
this final rule will increase the number of Notices of Detention issued 
for IPR violations, there is an increase in burden hours under this 
collection with this final rule.

8. Revise Sec.  133.42 to read as follows:


Sec.  133.42   Piratical articles; Unlawful copies or phonorecords of 
recorded copyrighted works.

    (a) Definition. A ``piratical article,'' for purposes of this part, 
is an unlawfully made (without the authorization of the copyright 
owner) copy or phonorecord of a recorded copyrighted work, importation 
of which is prohibited by the Copyright Act of 1976, as amended.
    (b) Detention, notice, and disclosure of information--(1) Detention 
period. CBP may detain any article of domestic or foreign manufacture 
imported into the United States that is suspected of constituting a 
piratical article in violation of a copyright recorded with CBP. The 
detention will be for a period of up to 30 days from the date on which 
the merchandise is presented for examination. In accordance with 19 
U.S.C. 1499(c), if, after the detention period, the article is not 
released, the article will be deemed excluded for purposes of 19 U.S.C. 
1514(a)(4).
    (2) Notice of detention to importer and disclosure to owner of the 
recorded copyrighted work--(i) Notice and seven business day response 
period. Within five business days from the date of a decision to detain 
suspect merchandise, CBP will notify the importer in writing of the 
detention as set forth in Sec.  151.16(c) of this chapter and 19 U.S.C. 
1499. CBP will also inform the importer that for purposes of assisting 
CBP in determining whether the detained merchandise is a piratical 
article:
    (A) CBP may have previously disclosed to the owner of the recorded 
copyright, prior to issuance of the notice of detention, limited 
importation information concerning the detained merchandise, as 
described in paragraph (b)(4) of this section, and, in any event, such 
information may be released to the owner of the recorded copyright, if 
available, no later than the date of issuance of the notice of 
detention; and
    (B) CBP may disclose to the owner of the recorded copyright 
information that appears on the detained merchandise and/or its retail 
packaging, including unredacted photographs, images, or samples, as 
described in paragraph (b)(3) of this section, unless the importer 
provides information within seven business days of the notification 
establishing that the detained merchandise is not piratical.
    (ii) Failure of importer to respond or insufficient response to 
notice. Where the importer does not provide information within the 
seven business day response period, or the information provided is 
insufficient for CBP to determine that the merchandise is not 
piratical, CBP will proceed with the disclosure of information as 
described in paragraph (b)(3) of this section to the owner of the 
recorded copyright, if CBP concludes that the disclosure would assist 
CBP in its determination, and provided that disclosure would not 
compromise an ongoing law enforcement investigation or national 
security. CBP will notify the importer in case of any such disclosure.
    (3) Disclosure to owner of the recorded copyright of information 
appearing on detained merchandise and/or its retail packaging, 
including unredacted photographs, images, or samples. CBP will disclose 
information appearing on the merchandise and/or its retail packaging 
(including labels), and images (including photographs) of the 
merchandise and/or its retail packaging in its condition as presented 
for examination (i.e., an unredacted condition) if CBP concludes that 
the disclosure of information to the owner of the recorded copyright as 
described in paragraph (b)(2)(ii) of this section would assist CBP in 
its determination, and provided that disclosure would not compromise an 
ongoing law enforcement investigation or national security. CBP may 
also provide a sample of the merchandise and/or its retail packaging in 
its condition as presented for examination to the owner of the recorded 
copyright. The release of a sample will be in accordance with, and 
subject to, the bond and return requirements of paragraph (c) of this 
section. The disclosure may include any serial numbers, dates of 
manufacture, lot codes, batch numbers, universal product codes, or 
other identifying markings appearing on the merchandise or its retail 
packaging (including labels), in alphanumeric or other formats.
    (4) Disclosure to owner of recorded copyright of limited 
importation information. From the time merchandise is presented for 
examination, CBP may disclose to the owner of the recorded copyright 
limited importation information to obtain assistance in determining 
whether an imported article is a piratical article. CBP may release the 
information prior to the issuance of the notice of detention, 
concurrently with the notice of detention, or, if the information is 
unavailable at the time the notice of detention is issued, CBP may 
release the information after issuance of the notice of detention. The 
limited importation information CBP may disclose to the owner of the 
recorded copyright consists of:
    (i) The date of importation;
    (ii) The port of entry;
    (iii) The description of the merchandise, for merchandise not yet 
detained, from the paper or electronic equivalent of the entry (as 
defined in Sec.  142.3(a)(1) or (b) of this chapter), the CBP Form 
7512, cargo manifest, advance electronic information or other entry 
document as appropriate, or, for detained merchandise, from the notice 
of detention;
    (iv) The quantity, for merchandise not yet detained, as declared on 
the paper or electronic equivalent of the entry (as defined in Sec.  
142.3(a)(1) or (b) of this chapter), the CBP Form 7512, cargo manifest, 
advance electronic information, or other entry document as appropriate, 
or, for detained merchandise, from the notice of detention; and
    (v) The country of origin of the merchandise.
    (5) Disclosure to owner of recorded copyright of redacted 
photographs, images and samples. Notwithstanding the notice and seven 
business day response procedure of paragraph (b)(2) of this section, 
CBP may, in order to obtain assistance in determining whether an 
imported article is a piratical article and at any time after 
presentation of the merchandise for examination, provide to the owner 
of the recorded copyright photographs, images, or a sample of the 
suspect merchandise or its retail packaging (including labels), 
provided that identifying information has been removed, obliterated, or 
otherwise obscured. Identifying information includes, but is not 
limited to, serial numbers, dates of manufacture, lot codes, batch 
numbers, universal product codes, the name or address of the 
manufacturer, exporter, or importer of the merchandise, or any markings 
that could reveal the name or address of the manufacturer, exporter, or 
importer of the merchandise, in alphanumeric or other formats. CBP may 
release a sample under this paragraph (b)(5) when the owner of the 
recorded copyright furnishes to CBP a bond in an amount specified by 
CBP and containing the conditions set forth in Sec.  113.70(a) of this 
chapter. CBP may demand the return of the sample at any time. The owner 
of the recorded copyright must return the sample to CBP upon demand or 
at the conclusion of any examination, testing, or similar procedure 
performed on the sample, whichever occurs sooner. In the event that the 
sample is damaged, destroyed, or lost while in the possession of the 
owner of the recorded copyright, the owner must, in lieu of return of 
the sample, certify to CBP that:

[[Page 52376]]

``The sample described as [insert description] and provided pursuant to 
19 CFR 133.42(b)(5) was (damaged/destroyed/lost) during examination, 
testing, or other use.''
    (c) Conditions of disclosure to owner of recorded copyright of 
information appearing on detained merchandise and/or its retail 
packaging, including unredacted photographs, images and samples--(1) 
Disclosure for limited purpose of assisting CBP in piratical 
merchandise determinations. In accordance with paragraphs (b)(2)(ii)

and that CBP is only disclosing the information to the owner of the 
recorded copyright for the purpose of assisting CBP in determining 
whether the merchandise is a piratical article.
    (2) Bond. CBP may release a sample under paragraph (b)(3) of this

sooner. In the event that the sample is damaged, destroyed, or lost 
while in the possession of the owner of the recorded copyright, the 
owner must, in lieu of return of the sample, certify to CBP that: ``The 
sample described as [insert description] and provided pursuant to 19

possession of the importer, the importer must, in lieu of return of the 
sample, certify to CBP that: ``The sample described as [insert 
description] and provided pursuant to 19 CFR 133.42(d) was (damaged/
destroyed/lost) during examination, testing, or other use.''
    (e) Seizure and disclosure to owner of the recorded copyright of 
comprehensive importation information. Upon a determination by CBP, 
made any time after the merchandise has been presented for examination, 
that an article of domestic or foreign manufacture imported into the 
United States is a piratical article, CBP will seize such merchandise 
and, in the absence of the written consent of the owner of the recorded 
copyright (see paragraph (g) of this section), forfeit the seized 
merchandise in accordance with the customs laws. When merchandise is 
seized under this section, CBP will disclose to the owner of the

CBP may demand the return of the sample at any time. The owner of the 
recorded copyright must return the sample to CBP upon demand or at the 
conclusion of the examination, testing, or other use, such as pursuit 
of a related civil remedy for infringement, whichever occurs sooner. In 
the event that the sample is damaged, destroyed, or lost while in the 
possession of the owner of the recorded copyright, the owner must, in 
lieu of return of the sample, certify to CBP that: ``The sample 
described as [insert description] and provided pursuant to 19 CFR

    (g) Consent of the owner of the recorded copyright; failure to make 
appropriate disposition. The owner of the recorded copyright, within 30 
days from notification of seizure, may provide written consent to the 
importer allowing the importation of the seized merchandise in its

Subpart F--Enforcement of the Prohibition on Importation of 
Merchandise Capable of Circumventing Technological Measures for 
Protection of Copyright


Sec.  133.47  Articles suspected of violating the Digital Millennium 
Copyright Act

    (a) Definitions--(1) Copyright protection measure. A technological 
measure that effectively controls access to, or effectively protects a 
right of a copyright owner in, a copyrighted work for which the 
copyright has been recorded with CBP.
    (2) Articles that violate the DMCA. Articles that violate the 
importation prohibitions of the Digital Millennium Copyright Act 
(DMCA), 17 U.S.C. 1201, consist of products, devices, components, or 
parts thereof primarily designed or produced for the purpose of 
circumventing a copyright protection measure, or which have only a 
limited commercially significant purpose or use other than such 
circumvention, or which are knowingly marketed by the manufacturer, 
importer, consignee, or other trafficker in such articles, or another 
acting in concert with the manufacturer importer, consignee, or 
trafficker for use in such circumvention.
    (3) Eligible person. The owner of a recorded copyright, who employs 
a copyright protection measure that may have been circumvented or 
attempted to

[[Page 52377]]

be circumvented by articles that violate the importation prohibitions 
of the DMCA.
    (4) Injured person. The owner of a recorded copyright, who employs 
a copyright protection measure that has been circumvented or attempted 
to be circumvented by articles seized for violation of the importation 
prohibitions of the DMCA, and who has successfully applied to CBP for 
DMCA protections pursuant to paragraph (b)(2)(iii) of this section.
    (b) Detention, notice, and disclosure of information--(1) Detention 
period. CBP may detain any article of domestic or foreign manufacture 
imported into the United States that it suspects is in violation of the 
DMCA, as described in paragraph (a)(2) of this section. The detention 
will be for a period of up to 30 days from the date on which the 
merchandise is presented for examination. In accordance with 19 U.S.C. 
1499(c), if, after the detention period, the article is not released, 
the article will be deemed excluded for the purposes of 19 U.S.C. 
1514(a)(4).
    (2) Notice of detention to importer and disclosure to eligible 
persons--(i) Notice and seven business day response period. Within five 
business days from the date of a decision to detain suspect 
merchandise, CBP will notify the importer in writing of the detention 
as set forth in Sec.  151.16(c) of this chapter and 19 U.S.C. 1499. CBP 
will also inform the importer that for purposes of assisting CBP in 
determining whether the detained merchandise violates the DMCA:
    (A) CBP may have previously disclosed to the eligible person, prior 
to issuance of the notice of detention, limited importation information 
concerning the detained merchandise, as described in paragraph (b)(4) 
of this section, and, in any event, such information may be released to 
the eligible person, if available, no later than the date of issuance 
of the notice of detention; and
    (B) CBP may disclose to the eligible person information that 
appears on the detained merchandise and/or its retail packaging, 
including unredacted photographs, images, or samples, as described in 
paragraph (b)(3) of this section, unless the importer provides 
information within seven business days of the notification establishing 
that the detained merchandise does not violate the DMCA.
    (ii) Failure of importer to respond or insufficient response to 
notice. Where the importer does not provide information within the 
seven business day response period, or the information provided is 
insufficient for CBP to determine that the merchandise does not violate 
the DMCA, CBP will proceed with the disclosure of information, as 
described in paragraph (b)(3) of this section, to the eligible person 
if CBP concludes that the disclosure would assist CBP in its 
determination, and provided that the disclosure would not compromise an 
ongoing law enforcement investigation or national security. CBP will 
notify the importer in case of any such disclosure.
    (iii) Request for DMCA protections and establishment of a list of 
persons approved for post-seizure disclosures. Eligible persons may 
apply to receive post-seizure disclosures from CBP by attaching a 
letter requesting such disclosures to an application to record or renew 
a copyright. Owners of existing copyright recordations may similarly 
apply for protection by submitting a letter requesting such disclosures 
to CBP. CBP will add those persons CBP approves for such disclosures to 
a list that CBP will maintain. CBP will provide the post-seizure 
disclosures described in this section to injured persons, as defined in 
this part, appearing on the list. CBP will publish a notice, signed by 
the Executive Director, Regulations and Rulings, of the establishment 
of the list in the Federal Register. After the list has been 
established, CBP will publish a notice of revisions to the list, signed 
by the Executive Director, Regulations and Rulings, in the Federal 
Register.
    (3) Disclosure to eligible persons of information appearing on 
detained merchandise and/or its retail packaging, including unredacted 
photographs, images or samples. CBP will disclose information appearing 
on the merchandise and/or its retail packaging (including labels) and 
images (including photographs) of the merchandise and/or its retail 
packaging in its condition as presented for examination (i.e., an 
unredacted condition) if CBP concludes that the disclosure of 
information to the eligible person as described in paragraph (b)(2)(ii) 
of this section would assist CBP in its determination, and provided 
that the disclosure would not compromise an ongoing law enforcement 
investigation or national security. CBP may also provide a sample of 
the merchandise and/or its retail packaging in its condition as 
presented for examination to the eligible person. The release of a 
sample will be in accordance with, and subject to, the bond and return 
requirements of paragraph (c) of this section. The disclosure may 
include any serial numbers, dates of manufacture, lot codes, batch 
numbers, universal product codes, or other identifying markings 
appearing on the merchandise or its retail packaging (including 
labels), in alphanumeric or other formats.
    (4) Disclosure to eligible person of limited importation 
information. From the time merchandise is presented for examination, 
CBP may disclose to the eligible person limited importation information 
in order to obtain assistance in determining whether an imported 
article violates the DMCA. CBP may release the information prior to the 
issuance of the notice of detention, concurrently with the notice of 
detention, or, if the information is unavailable at the time the notice 
of detention is issued, CBP may release the information after issuance 
of the notice of detention. The limited importation information CBP may 
disclose to the eligible person consists of:
    (i) The date of importation;
    (ii) The port of entry;
    (iii) The description of the merchandise, for merchandise not yet 
detained, from the paper or electronic equivalent of the entry (as 
defined in Sec.  142.3(a)(1) or (b) of this chapter), the CBP Form 
7512, cargo manifest, advance electronic information or other entry 
document as appropriate, or, for detained merchandise, from the notice 
of detention;
    (iv) The quantity, for merchandise not yet detained, as declared on 
the paper or electronic equivalent of the entry (as defined in Sec.  
142.3(a)(1) or (b) of this chapter), the CBP Form 7512, cargo manifest, 
advance electronic information, or other entry document as appropriate, 
or, for detained merchandise, from the notice of detention; and
    (v) The country of origin of the merchandise.
    (5) Disclosure to eligible person of redacted photographs, images 
and samples. Notwithstanding the notice and seven business day response 
procedure of paragraph (b)(2) of this section, CBP may, in order to 
obtain assistance in determining whether an imported article violates 
the DMCA and at any time after presentation of the merchandise for 
examination, provide to the eligible person photographs, images, or a 
sample of the suspect merchandise or its retail packaging (including 
labels), provided that identifying information has been removed, 
obliterated, or otherwise obscured. Identifying information includes, 
but is not limited to, serial numbers, dates of manufacture, lot codes, 
batch numbers, universal product codes, the name or address of the 
manufacturer, exporter, or importer of the merchandise, or any markings 
that could reveal the name or address of the

[[Page 52378]]

manufacturer, exporter, or importer of the merchandise, in alphanumeric 
or other formats. CBP may release a sample under this paragraph (b)(5) 
when the eligible person furnishes to CBP a bond in an amount specified 
by CBP and containing the conditions set forth in Sec.  113.70(a) of 
this chapter. CBP may demand the return of the sample at any time. The 
eligible person must return the sample to CBP upon demand or at the 
conclusion of any examination, testing, or similar procedure performed 
on the sample, whichever occurs sooner. In the event that the sample is 
damaged, destroyed, or lost while in the possession of the eligible 
person, the eligible person must, in lieu of return of the sample, 
certify to CBP that: ``The sample described as [insert description] and 
provided pursuant to 19 CFR 133.47(b)(5) was (damaged/destroyed/lost) 
during examination, testing, or other use.''
    (c) Conditions of disclosure to eligible person of information 
appearing on detained merchandise and/or its retail packaging, 
including unredacted photographs, images and samples--(1) Disclosure 
for limited purpose of assisting CBP in DMCA determinations. In 
accordance with paragraphs (b)(2)(ii) and (b)(3) of this section, when 
CBP discloses information to an eligible person prior to seizure, CBP 
will notify the eligible person that some or all of the information 
being released may be subject to the protections of the Trade Secrets 
Act, and that CBP is only disclosing the information to the eligible 
person for the purpose of assisting CBP in determining whether the 
merchandise violates the DMCA.
    (2) Bond. CBP may release a sample under paragraph (b)(3) of this 
section when the eligible person furnishes to CBP a bond in an amount 
specified by CBP and containing the conditions set forth in Sec.  
113.70(a) of this chapter. CBP may demand the return of the sample at 
any time. The eligible person must return the sample to CBP upon demand 
or at the conclusion of any examination, testing, or similar procedure 
performed on the sample, whichever occurs sooner. In the event that the 
sample is damaged, destroyed, or lost while in the possession of the 
eligible person, the eligible person must, in lieu of return of the 
sample, certify to CBP that: ``The sample described as [insert 
description] and provided pursuant to 19 CFR 133.47(c) was (damaged/
destroyed/lost) during examination, testing, or other use.''
    (d) Disclosure to importer of unredacted photographs, images or 
samples. CBP will disclose to the importer unredacted photographs, 
images, or an unredacted sample of imported merchandise suspected of 
violating the DMCA at any time after the merchandise is presented to 
CBP for examination. CBP may demand the return of the sample at any 
time. The importer must return the sample to CBP upon demand or at the 
conclusion of any examination, testing, or similar procedure performed 
on the sample, whichever occurs sooner. In the event that the sample is 
damaged, destroyed, or lost while in the possession of the importer, 
the importer must, in lieu of return of the sample, certify to CBP 
that: ``The sample described as [insert description] and provided 
pursuant to 19 CFR 133.47(d) was (damaged/destroyed/lost) during 
examination, testing, or other use.''
    (e) Seizure and disclosure to injured person of comprehensive 
importation information. Upon a determination by CBP, made any time 
after the merchandise has been presented for examination, that an 
article of domestic or foreign manufacture imported into the United 
States violates the DMCA as described in paragraph (a)(2) of this 
section, CBP will seize such merchandise and, in the absence of written 
consent of the injured person (see paragraph (g) of this section), 
forfeit the seized merchandise in accordance with the customs laws. 
When merchandise is seized under this section, CBP will disclose to the 
injured person the following comprehensive importation information, if

    (a) Exemptions from applicability. The provisions of this section 
are not applicable to detentions effected by CBP on behalf of other 
agencies of the U.S. Government in whom the determination of 
admissibility is vested.
    (b) Decision to detain or release. Within five business days from 
the date on which merchandise is presented for CBP examination, CBP 
will decide whether to release or detain merchandise. Merchandise that 
is not released within the five business day period will be considered 
to be detained merchandise under 19 U.S.C. 1499(c)(1). For purposes of 
this section, merchandise will be considered to be presented for CBP 
examination when it is in a condition to be viewed and examined by a 
CBP officer. Mere presentation to the examining officer of a cargo van, 
container, or instrument of international traffic in which the 
merchandise to be examined is contained will not be considered to be 
presentation of merchandise for CBP examination for purposes of this 
section. Except when merchandise is examined at the public stores, the 
importer must pay all costs relating to the preparation and 
transportation of merchandise for CBP examination.
    (c) Notice of detention. If a decision to detain merchandise is 
made, or the merchandise is not released within the five business day 
period described in paragraph (b) of this section, CBP will issue a 
notice to the importer or other party having an interest in such 
merchandise within five business days from such decision or failure to 
release. Issuance of a notice of detention is not to be construed as a 
final determination as to admissibility of the merchandise. The notice 
will be prepared by the CBP officer detaining the merchandise and will 
advise the importer or other interested party of the:
    (1) Initiation of the detention, including the date the merchandise 
was presented for examination;
    (2) Specific reason for the detention;
    (3) Anticipated length of the detention;
    (4) Nature of the tests or inquiries to be conducted; and
    (5) Nature of any information which, if supplied to CBP, may 
accelerate the disposition of the detention.
