executive officers of troubled or newly chartered credit unions to 
determine their fitness for the position. This is established by the 
Financial Institutions Reform, Recovery, and Enforcement Act of 1989

    Abstract: In accordance with Sec.  741.8, federally insured credit 
unions (FICUs) must request approval from the NCUA prior to purchasing 
assets or assuming liabilities of a privately insured credit union, 
other financial institution, or their successor interest. A FICU 
seeking approval must submit a letter to the appropriate Regional 
Director stating the nature of the transaction, and include copies of 
relevant transaction documents. Relevant transactions documents may 
include, but are not limited to: the credit union's financial 
statements, strategic plan, and budget, inventory of the assets and 
liabilities to be transferred, and any relevant contracts or agreements
