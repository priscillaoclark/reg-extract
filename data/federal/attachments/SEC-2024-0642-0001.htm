website at <a href="https://listingcenter.nasdaq.com/rulebook/nasdaq/rules">https://listingcenter.nasdaq.com/rulebook/nasdaq/rules</a>, at 
the principal office of the Exchange, and at the Commission's Public 
Reference Room.

II. Self-Regulatory Organization's Statement of the Purpose of, and 
Statutory Basis for, the Proposed Rule Change

    In its filing with the Commission, the Exchange included statements 
concerning the purpose of and basis for the proposed rule change and 
discussed any comments it received on the proposed rule change. The 
text of these statements may be examined at the places specified in 
Item IV below. The Exchange has prepared summaries, set forth in 
sections A, B, and C below, of the most significant aspects of such 
statements.

A. Self-Regulatory Organization's Statement of the Purpose of, and 
Statutory Basis for, the Proposed Rule Change

1. Purpose
    On April 20, 2021, Nasdaq filed a proposal to re-platform three of 
its products for trade reporting, surveillance and risk management 
services--(1) ACT Workstation (``Workstation''),\5\ (2) Nasdaq InterACT 
(``InterACT'') \6\ and (3) Nasdaq Risk Management (``Risk Management'') 
(collectively, the ``Legacy Products''). \7\ These products were 
renamed (1) Nasdaq WorkX\TM\ (``WorkX''), (2) Nasdaq Real-Time Stats 
(``Real-Time Stats'') and (3) Nasdaq Post-Trade Risk Management 
(``Post-Trade Risk Management''), respectively (collectively, the 
``Enhanced Products.''). At the time of the proposal, Nasdaq stated 
that once all current participants had migrated to the Re-Platformed 
products, the Exchange would retire the services and remove the Legacy 
Products from its fee schedule.\8\ The Exchange is proposing to amend 
Equity 7, Sections 70, 115 116, 149 and 161, and to remove Sections 
116-A and 149-A of the Exchange's pricing schedule to retire services 
and products that have been replaced by enhanced services.\9\
---------------------------------------------------------------------------

    \5\ Workstation is a web-based application that electronically 
facilitates trade reporting and clearing functions for trades 
reported to the FINRA/Nasdaq TRF. Workstation services include trade 
entry, trade scan, and uploads for bulk trade entry to support 
FINRA/Nasdaq TRF participant trade reporting in accordance with 
Financial Industry Regulatory Authority (``FINRA'') rules.
    \6\ InterACT is a real-time compliance tool that assists firms 
with regulatory supervision of trade activity reported to the FINRA/
Nasdaq TRF. InterACT summarizes and consolidates data for over-the-
counter trade reports to help customers comply with FINRA rules.
    \7\ See Securities Exchange Act Release No. 34-91744 (May 3, 
20221), 86 FR 24685 (May 7, 2021) (SR-NASDAQ-2021-025) (``Initial 
Filing'').
    \8\ Id. at 24686 n. 7, 24687.
    \9\ There will be no changes to the fees as a result of the 
retirement of the retired services.
---------------------------------------------------------------------------

    While Nasdaq provided the option of users to maintain access to, 
and utilize, both the Legacy and Re-Platformed Products,\10\ as of 
January 2024, all current participants have fully migrated to the Re-
Platformed Products and no customers currently use the Legacy Products. 
Therefore, Nasdaq is proposing to retire the services and remove the 
Legacy Products from its fee schedule. Additionally, Nasdaq is 
proposing to clarify that certain services that were previously add-on 
services to Workstation will be stand-alone services.\11\
---------------------------------------------------------------------------

    \10\ See Initial Filing at 24687; Securities Exchange Act 
Release No. 34-98582 (September 28, 2023), 88 FR 68760, 68761 (Oct. 
4, 2023) (SR-NASDAQ-2023-038).
    \11\ TradeInfo (Section 115(f)) and IPO Indicator (Section 
115(i)) will continue to be available as stand-alone services. IPO 
Locator (Section 161) was previously an add-on and a stand-alone 
service but will only be a stand-alone service accessed through 
WorkX going forward.
---------------------------------------------------------------------------

2. Statutory Basis
    The Exchange believes that its proposal is consistent with Section 
6(b) of the Act,\12\ in general, and furthers the objectives of 
Sections 6(b)(4) and 6(b)(5) of the Act,\13\ in particular, in that it 
provides for the equitable allocation of reasonable dues, fees and 
other charges among members and issuers and other persons using any 
facility, and is not designed to permit unfair discrimination between 
customers, issuers, brokers, or dealers. The proposal is also designed 
to promote just and equitable principles of trade, to remove 
impediments to and perfect the mechanism of a free and open market and 
a national market system, and, in general to protect investors and the 
public interest.
---------------------------------------------------------------------------

    \12\ 15 U.S.C. 78f(b).
    \13\ 15 U.S.C. 78f(b)(4) and (5).
---------------------------------------------------------------------------

    The purpose of this proposal is to remove the discontinued Legacy 
Products from the Exchange's rulebook and to inform the SEC and market 
participants of that change. The Exchange believes that the proposal to 
retire the Legacy Products is reasonable and not unfairly 
discriminatory because the Re-Platformed Products provide similar but 
enhanced features and have replaced the Legacy Products. Moreover, no 
participants currently utilize the Legacy Products and have all 
transitioned to the Re-Platformed Products and no participant will be 
disrupted by the proposed change. For the same reason, the Exchange 
believes that the proposed changes remove impediments to and perfect 
the mechanism of a free and open market and a national market system, 
constitute an equitable allocation of fees, and protect investors and 
the public interest because under the proposed rule, the Exchange's 
rulebook would eliminate certain products that are no longer being 
offered to customers and the fees for the Re-Platformed Products would 
continue to remain the same. Additionally, from time to time, the 
Exchange reviews its rulebook to ensure that its fees are accurate and 
align with its current operation to protect investors and the public 
interest.
    The Exchange believes that the proposal is not unfairly 
discriminatory. All member firms have been notified of the retirement 
of the Legacy Products and have had an opportunity to access the 
Enhance Products. Any firm that was not satisfied with the Enhanced 
Products was given over a year to find an alternate service offered by 
a third party. Moreover, the fees for the

[[Page 42555]]

Enhanced Products continue to remain the same for all member firms.

B. Self-Regulatory Organization's Statement on Burden on Competition

    The Exchange does not believe that the proposed rule change will 
result in any burden on competition that is not necessary or 
appropriate in furtherance of the purposes of the Act. As explained 
above, the purpose of this proposal is to remove the discontinued 
Legacy Products from the Exchange's rulebook and to inform the SEC and 
market participants of that change. The Enhanced Products will continue 
to be available to all market participants and the fees will remain the 
same as the Legacy Products.

C. Self-Regulatory Organization's Statement on Comments on the Proposed 
Rule Change Received From Members, Participants, or Others

    The Exchange neither solicited nor received comments on the 
proposed rule change.

III. Date of Effectiveness of the Proposed Rule Change and Timing for 
Commission Action

    Because the foregoing proposed rule change does not:
    A. significantly affect the protection of investors or the public 
interest;
    B. impose any significant burden on competition; and
    C. become operative for 30 days from the date on which it was 
filed, or such shorter time as the Commission may designate, it has 
become effective pursuant to Section 19(b)(3)(A) of the Act \14\ and 
Rule 19b-4(f)(6) \15\ thereunder.\16\ At any time within 60 days of the 
filing of the proposed rule change, the Commission summarily may 
temporarily suspend such rule change if it appears to the Commission 
that such action is necessary or appropriate in the public interest, 
for the protection of investors, or otherwise in furtherance of the 
purposes of the Act. If the Commission takes such action, the 
Commission will institute proceedings to determine whether the proposed 
rule change should be approved or disapproved.
---------------------------------------------------------------------------

    \14\ 15 U.S.C. 78s(b)(3)(A).
    \15\ 17 CFR 240.19b-4(f)(6).
    \16\ 17 CFR 240.19b-4(f)(6). In addition, Rule 19b-4(f)(6) 
requires a self-regulatory organization to give the Commission 
written notice of its intent to file the proposed rule change at 
least five business days prior to the date of filing of the proposed 
rule change, or such shorter time as designated by the Commission. 
The Exchange has satisfied this requirement.
