I. Self-Regulatory Organization's Statement of the Terms of Substance 
of the Proposed Rule Change

    The Exchange proposes to increase the class quoting limit in one 
option class. The text of the proposed rule change is available on 
CBOE's Web site (<A HREF="http://frwebgate.access.gpo.gov/cgi-bin/leaving.cgi?from=leavingFR.html&log=linklog&to=http://www.cboe.org/legal">http://www.cboe.org/legal</A>), at the CBOE's Office of 
the Secretary, and at the Commission's public reference room.

II. Self-Regulatory Organization's Statement of the Purpose of, and 
Statutory Basis for, the Proposed Rule Change

    In its filing with the Commission, the Exchange included statements 
concerning the purpose of and basis for the proposed rule change and 
discussed any comments it received on the proposed rule change. The 
text of these statements may be examined at the places specified in 
Item IV below. The Exchange has prepared summaries, set forth in 
sections (A), (B), and (C) below, of the most significant parts of such 
statements.

A. Self-Regulatory Organization's Statement of the Purpose of, and 
Statutory Basis for, the Proposed Rule Change

1. Purpose
    CBOE Rule 8.3A, Maximum Number of Market Participants Quoting 
Electronically per Product, establishes class quoting limits (``CQLs'') 
for each class traded on the Hybrid Trading System.\5\ A CQL is the 
maximum number of quoters that may quote electronically in a given 
product and Rule 8.3A, Interpretation .01(a) provides that the current 
levels are generally established at 50.
---------------------------------------------------------------------------

    \5\ See Rule 8.3A.01.
---------------------------------------------------------------------------

    In addition, Rule 8.3A, Interpretation .01(b) provides a procedure 
by which the President of the Exchange may increase the CQL for an 
existing or new product. In this regard, the President of the Exchange 
may increase the CQL in a particular product when he deems it 
appropriate. The effect of an increase in the CQL is procompetitive in 
that it increases the number of market participants that may quote 
electronically in a product. The purpose of this filing is to increase 
the CQL in options on the CBOE Volatility Index (VIX) from its current 
limit of 50 to 60, which CBOE's President has determined would be 
appropriate.\6\ Increasing the CQL also may enhance the liquidity 
offered in the option class. Lastly, CBOE represents that it has the 
systems capacity to support this increase in the CQL.
---------------------------------------------------------------------------

    \6\ CBOE's President has determined that this increase would be 
appropriate, in part, due to the relocation of several option 
classes, including VIX, to a larger trading station on the trading 
floor which may enhance the liquidity offered in the option class. 
E-mail dated September 28, 2010, from Patrick Sexton, Associate 
General Counsel, CBOE.
---------------------------------------------------------------------------

2. Statutory Basis
    CBOE believes the proposed rule change is consistent with the Act 
and the rules and regulations under the Act applicable to a national 
securities exchange and, in particular, the requirements of section 
6(b) of the Act.\7\ Specifically, the Exchange believes the proposed 
rule change is consistent with the Section 6(b)(5) \8\ requirements 
that the rules of an exchange be designed to promote just and equitable 
principles of trade, to prevent fraudulent and manipulative acts and, 
in general, to protect investors and the public interest. As indicated 
above, the Exchange believes that increasing the CQL in this

option class is procompetitive and may enhance the liquidity offered.
---------------------------------------------------------------------------

    \7\ 15 U.S.C. 78f(b).
    \8\ 15 U.S.C. 78f(b)(5).
---------------------------------------------------------------------------

B. Self-Regulatory Organization's Statement on Burden on Competition

    CBOE does not believe that the proposed rule change will impose any 
burden on competition not necessary or appropriate in furtherance of 
the purposes of the Exchange Act.

C. Self-Regulatory Organization's Statement on Comments on the Proposed 
Rule Change Received From Members, Participants, or Others

    The Exchange neither received nor solicited written comments on the 
proposal.

III. Date of Effectiveness of the Proposed Rule Change and Timing for 
Commission Action

    The foregoing proposed rule change will take effect upon filing 
with the Commission pursuant to Section 19(b)(3)(A)(i) of the Act \9\ 
and Rule 19b-4(f)(1) thereunder,\10\ because it constitutes a stated 
policy, practice, or interpretation with respect to the meaning, 
administration, or enforcement of an existing rule.
---------------------------------------------------------------------------

    \9\ 15 U.S.C. 78s(b)(3)(A)(i).
    \10\ 17 CFR 240.19b-4(f)(1).
---------------------------------------------------------------------------

    At any time within 60 days of the filing of the proposed rule 
change, the Commission summarily may temporarily suspend such rule 
change if it appears to the Commission that such action is necessary or 
appropriate in the public interest, for the protection of investors, or 
otherwise in furtherance of the purposes of the Act.
