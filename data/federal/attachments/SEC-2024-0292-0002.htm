SECURITIES AND EXCHANGE COMMISSION

[SEC File No. 270-770, OMB Control No. 3235-0750]


Submission for OMB Review; Comment Request; Extension: Rule 18a-8

Upon Written Request, Copies Available From: Securities and Exchange 
Commission, Office of FOIA Services, 100 F Street NE, Washington, DC 
20549-2736

    Notice is hereby given that, pursuant to the Paperwork Reduction 
Act of 1995 (44 U.S.C. 3501 et seq.), the Securities and Exchange 
Commission (``Commission'') has submitted to the Office of Management 
and Budget (``OMB'') a request for extension of the previously approved 
collection of information discussed below.
    Exchange Act Rule 18a-8 (17 CFR 240.18a-8) specifies the 
circumstances under which stand-alone security-based swap dealers 
(``SBSDs''), stand-alone major security-based swap participants 
(``MSBSPs''), bank SBSDs, and bank MSBSPs must notify the Commission 
about their financial or operational condition, as well as the form 
that the notice must take.
    The Commission estimates that the total hour burden under Rule 18a-
8 is approximately 5 burden hours per year, and the total cost burden 
is approximately $0 per year. There has been no change in the estimated 
total hour and cost burdens since the last approval of this information 
collection.
    An agency may not conduct or sponsor, and a person is not required 
to respond to, a collection of information under the PRA unless it 
displays a currently valid OMB control number.

collection at the following website: <a href="http://www.reginfo.gov">www.reginfo.gov</a>. Find this
