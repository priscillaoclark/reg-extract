SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION:
    Title: Reporting, Procedures and Penalties Regulations.
    OMB Number: 1505-0164.
    Agency Form Number: TD-F-90-22.50.
    Abstract: The collections of information are contained in sections 
501.601 through 501.605, 501.801, and 501.803 through 501.807 and 
pertain to the operation of various economic sanctions programs 
administered by OFAC under 31 CFR Chapter V. Section 501.601 relates to 
the maintenance of records, and section 501.602 relates to OFAC demands 
for information relative to any transaction or property subject to the 
provisions of 31 CFR Chapter V. Section 501.603 imposes reporting 
requirements pertaining to blocked assets and retained funds transfers. 
This information is required by OFAC to monitor compliance with 
regulatory requirements, to support diplomatic negotiations concerning 
the targets of sanctions, and to support settlement negotiations 
addressing U.S. claims. Section 501.604 requires the filing of reports 
for compliance purposes by U.S. financial institutions where a funds 
transfer is not required to be blocked but is rejected because the 
underlying transaction is otherwise prohibited. Section 501.605 
requires reporting of information pertaining to litigation, 
arbitration, and other binding alternative dispute resolution 
proceedings in the United States to prevent the intentional or 
inadvertent transfer through such proceedings of blocked property or 
retained funds. Sections 501.801 and 501.803 through 501.805 relate to 
license requests; the amendment, modification or revocation of 
licenses; rulemaking; and document requests. Section 501.806 sets forth 
the procedures to be followed by a person seeking to have funds 
released at a financial institution if the person believes that the 
funds were blocked due to mistaken identity. Section 501.807 sets forth 
the procedures to be followed by persons seeking administrative 
reconsideration of their designation or the designation of a vessel as 
blocked, or who wish to assert that the circumstances resulting in the 
designation are no longer applicable.
    The likely respondents and recordkeepers affected by the 
information collections contained in part 501 are financial 
institutions, business organizations, individuals, and legal 
representatives. The estimated total annual reporting and/or 
recordkeeping burden is approximately 26,250 hours. The estimated 
annual burden per respondent/record keeper varies from 30 minutes to 10 
hours, depending on individual circumstances, with an estimated average 
of 1.25 hours. The estimated number of respondents and/or record 
keepers is 21,000. The estimated annual frequency of responses: 1-12.
    Current Actions: There are no changes being made to the notice at 
this time.
    Type of Review: Extension of a currently approved collection.
    Affected Public: Financial institutions, business organizations, 
individuals, and legal representatives.
    Estimated Number of Respondents: 21,000.
    Estimated Time per Respondent: 1.25 hours.
    Estimated Total Annual Burden Hours: 26,250.
    The following paragraph applies to all of the collections of 
information covered by this notice:
    An agency may not conduct or sponsor, and a person is not required 
to respond to, a collection of information unless the collection of 
information displays a valid OMB control number. Books or records 
relating to a collection of information must be retained for five 
years.

Request for Comments

    Comments submitted in response to this notice will be summarized 
and/or included in the request for OMB approval. All comments will 
become a matter of public record. Comments are invited on: (a) Whether 
the collection of information is necessary for the proper performance 
of the functions of the agency, including whether the information has 
practical utility; (b) the accuracy of the agency's estimate of the 
burden of the collection of information; (c) ways to enhance the 
quality, utility, and clarity of the information to be collected; (d) 
ways to minimize the burden of the collection of information on 
respondents, including through the use of automated collection 
techniques or other forms of information technology; and (e) estimates 
of capital or start-up costs and costs of operation, maintenance, and 
purchase of services to provide information.

    Approved: May 18, 2009.
Barbara C. Hammerle,
Acting Director, Office of Foreign Assets Control.
