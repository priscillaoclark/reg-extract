SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION: On June 15, 1984, OMB delegated to the Board 
authority under the Paperwork Reduction Act (PRA) to approve and assign 
OMB control numbers to collections of information conducted or 
sponsored by the Board. In exercising this delegated authority, the 
Board is directed to take every reasonable step to solicit comment. In 
determining whether to approve a collection of information, the Board 
will consider all comments received from the public and other agencies.
    During the comment period for this proposal, a copy of the proposed 
PRA OMB submission, including the draft reporting form and 
instructions, supporting statement (which contains more detail about 
the information collection and burden estimates than this notice), and 
other documentation, will be made available on the Board's public 
website at <a href="https://www.federalreserve.gov/apps/reportingforms/home/review">https://www.federalreserve.gov/apps/reportingforms/home/review</a> or may be requested from the agency clearance officer, whose 
name appears above. Final versions of these documents will be made 
available at <a href="https://www.reginfo.gov/public/do/PRAMain">https://www.reginfo.gov/public/do/PRAMain</a>, if approved.

Request for Comment on Information Collection Proposals

    The Board invites public comment on the following information 
collections, which are being reviewed under authority delegated by the 
OMB under the PRA. Comments are invited on the following:
    a. Whether the proposed collections of information are necessary 
for the proper performance of the Board's functions, including whether 
the information has practical utility;
    b. The accuracy of the Board's estimate of the burden of the 
proposed information collections, including the validity of the 
methodology and assumptions used;
    c. Ways to enhance the quality, utility, and clarity of the 
information to be collected;
    d. Ways to minimize the burden of information collection on 
respondents, including through the use of automated collection 
techniques or other forms of information technology; and
    e. Estimates of capital or startup costs and costs of operation, 
maintenance, and purchase of services to provide information.
    At the end of the comment period, the comments and recommendations 
received will be analyzed to determine the extent to which the Board 
should modify the proposal.

Proposal Under OMB Delegated Authority To Extend for Three Years, With 
Revision, the Following Information Collections

    Collection title: Bank Holding Company Applications and 
Notifications.
    Collection identifier: FR Y-3, FR Y-3N, and FR Y-4.
    OMB control number: 7100-0121.
    General description of collection: These filings collect 
information on proposals by Bank Holding Companies (BHCs) involving 
formations, acquisitions, mergers, and nonbanking activities. The Board 
requires the submission of these filings for regulatory and supervisory 
purposes and to allow the Board to fulfill its statutory obligations 
under the Bank Holding Company Act of 1956 (the BHC Act). The Board 
uses this information to evaluate each individual transaction with 
respect to financial and managerial factors, permissibility, 
competitive effects, financial stability, net public benefits, and 
impact on the convenience and needs of affected communities.
    Proposed revisions: The Board proposes to revise the FR Y-3, FR Y-
3N, and FR Y-4 forms and instructions to update or add certain 
citations and references; delete language that requires an explanation 
of the assumptions used in financial projections only if the 
projections deviate from historical performance; remove the sample 
publication from the instruction; add questions regarding groups acting 
in concert, individuals who would own 10 percent or more of the 
applicant, and companies that would own five percent or more of the 
applicant; add a requirement that applicants provide a breakdown of pro 
forma equity; add a requirement that applicants identify any management 
official of the applicant who is also a management official at another 
depository institution; and add a question regarding the integration of 
the target into the applicant.
    Frequency: Event-generated.
    Respondents: BHCs and a company seeking to become a BHC.
    Total estimated number of respondents: 335.
    Total estimated change in burden: 388.
    Total estimated annual burden hours: 7,603.\1\
