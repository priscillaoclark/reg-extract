SECURITIES AND EXCHANGE COMMISSION

[SEC File No. 270-433, OMB Control No. 3235-0489]


Submission for OMB Review; Comment Request; Extension: Rule 17a-6

Upon Written Request, Copies Available From: Securities and Exchange 
Commission, Office of FOIA Services, 100 F Street NE, Washington, DC 
20549-2736

    Notice is hereby given that pursuant to the Paperwork Reduction Act 
of 1995 (``PRA'') (44 U.S.C. 3501 et seq.), the Securities and Exchange 
Commission (``Commission'') has submitted to the Office of Management 
and Budget (``OMB'') a request for approval of extension of the 
previously approved collection of information provided for in Rule 17a-
6 (17 CFR 240.17a-6) under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 (15 
U.S.C. 78a et seq.).
    Rule 17a-6 permits national securities exchanges, national 
securities associations, registered clearing agencies, and the 
Municipal Securities Rulemaking Board (``MSRB'') (collectively, 
``SROs'') to destroy or convert to microfilm or other recording media 
records maintained under Rule 17a-1, if they have filed a record 
destruction plan with the Commission and the Commission has declared 
such plan effective.
    There are currently 36 SROs: 25 national securities exchanges, 1 
national securities association, the MSRB, and 9 registered clearing 
agencies. Of the 36 SROs, only 2 SRO respondents have filed a record 
destruction plan with the Commission. The staff calculates that the 
preparation and filing of a new record destruction plan should take 160 
hours. Further, any existing SRO record destruction plans may require 
revision, over time, in response to, for example, changes in document 
retention technology, which the Commission estimates will take much 
less than the 160 hours estimated for a new plan. The Commission 
estimates that each SRO that has filed a destruction plan will spend 
approximately 30 hours per year making required revisions. Thus, the 
total annual time burden is estimated to be approximately 60 hours per 
year based on two respondents (30 hours per respondent x 2 
respondents).
    An agency may not conduct or sponsor, and a person is not required 
to respond to, a collection of information under the PRA unless it 
displays a currently valid OMB control number.
    The public may view background documentation for this information 
collection at the following website: <a href="http://www.reginfo.gov">www.reginfo.gov</a>. Find this

Review--Open for Public Comments'' or by using the search function.

    Dated: August 26, 2024.
Vanessa A. Countryman,
Secretary.
