SECURITIES AND EXCHANGE COMMISSION

[SEC File No. 270-557, OMB Control No. 3235-0618]


Submission for OMB Review; Comment Request; Extension: Rule 173

Upon Written Request Copies Available From: Securities and Exchange 
Commission, Office of FOIA Services, 100 F Street NE, Washington, DC 
20549-2736

    Notice is hereby given that, pursuant to the Paperwork Reduction 
Act of 1995 (44 U.S.C. 3501 et seq.), the Securities and Exchange 
Commission (``Commission'') has submitted to the Office of Management 
and Budget this request for extension of the previously approved 
collection of information discussed below.
    Securities Act Rule 173 (17 CFR 230.173) provides a notice of 
registration to investors who purchased securities in a registered 
offering under the Securities Act of 1933 (15 U.S.C. 77a et seq.). A 
Rule 173 notice must be provided by each underwriter or dealer to each 
investor who purchased securities from the underwriter or dealer. The 
Rule 173 notice is not publicly available. We estimate that it takes 
approximately 0.0167 hour per response to provide the information 
required under Rule 173 and that the information is filed by 
approximately 5,720 respondents approximately 43,546 times a year for a 
total of 249,083,120 responses. We estimate that the total annual 
reporting burden for Rule 173 is 4,159,688 hours (0.0167 hours per 
response x 249,083,120 responses).
