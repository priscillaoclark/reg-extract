material of Bulgaria. The Assistant Secretary for Educational and 
Cultural Affairs, United States Department of State, has made the 
requisite determinations for extending and modifying the import 
restrictions originally imposed by CBP Dec. 14-01, and amended by CBP 
Decision 19-01. The restrictions are being extended through January 14,

SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION:

Background

    The Convention on Cultural Property Implementation Act (Pub. L. 97-
446, 19 U.S.C. 2601 et seq.) (CPIA), which implements the 1970 United 
Nations Educational, Scientific and Cultural Organization (UNESCO) 
Convention on the Means of Prohibiting and Preventing the Illicit 
Import, Export and Transfer of Ownership of Cultural Property (823 
U.N.T.S. 231 (1972)) (the Convention), allows for the conclusion of an 
agreement between the United States and another party to the Convention 
to impose import restrictions on eligible archaeological and 
ethnological materials. Under the CPIA and applicable U.S. Customs and 
Border Protection (CBP) regulations, found in section 12.104 of title 
19 of the Code of Federal Regulations (19 CFR 12.104), the restrictions 
are effective for no more than five years beginning on the date on 
which an agreement enters into force with respect to the United States 
(19 U.S.C. 2602(b)). This period may be extended for additional 
periods, each extension not to exceed five years, if it is determined 
that the factors justifying the initial agreement still pertain and no 
cause for suspension of the agreement exists (19 U.S.C. 2602(e); 19 CFR 
12.104g(a)).
    On January 14, 2014, the United States entered into a memorandum of 
understanding (2014 MOU) with the Republic of Bulgaria (Bulgaria), 
concerning the imposition of import restrictions on certain categories 
of archaeological and ecclesiastical ethnological material of Bulgaria. 
On January 16, 2014, CBP published a final rule, CBP Dec. 14-01, in the 
Federal Register (79 FR 2781) to reflect the imposition of restrictions 
on this material, including a list designating the types of 
archaeological and ecclesiastical ethnological materials covered by the 
restrictions. Consistent with the requirements of 19 U.S.C. 2602(b) and 
19 CFR 12.104g, these restrictions were effective for a period of five 
years, through January 14, 2019.
    The import restrictions were subsequently extended in accordance 
with 19 U.S.C. 2602(e) and 19 CFR 12.104g(a). On January 8, 2019, the 
United States entered into a superseding memorandum of understanding 
(2019 MOU) with Bulgaria to extend the import restrictions. 
Accordingly, CBP published a final rule, CBP Dec. 19-01, in the Federal 
Register (84 FR 112) amending 19 CFR 12.104g(b) to extend the import 
restrictions and correct an inconsistency in the 2014 MOU listing the 
ecclesiastical ethnological material as ranging in date from A.D. 681 
rather than as listed in the Designated List as from the beginning of 
the 4th century A.D.
    On May 19, 2023, the United States Department of State published a 
proposal to extend and amend the 2019 MOU, in the Federal Register (88 
FR 32265). On November 7, 2023, after considering the views and 
recommendations of the Cultural Property Advisory Committee, the Acting 
Assistant Secretary for Educational and Cultural Affairs, United States 
Department of State, made the determinations necessary to extend and 
amend the 2019 MOU. Following an exchange of diplomatic notes, the 
United States Department of State and the Ministry of Foreign Affairs 
of the Republic of Bulgaria have agreed to amend the 2019 MOU, and 
extend the restrictions for an additional five-year period, through 
January 14, 2029.
    Accordingly, CBP is amending 19 CFR 12.104g(a) to reflect the 
extension of the import restrictions and amendment of the Designated 
List of cultural property described in CBP Dec. 14-01 and revised by 
CBP Dec. 19-01. The amendments include the expansion of dates for 
archaeological and ecclesiastical ethnological material, corrections to 
minor inconsistencies in the Designated List in CBP Dec. 19-01, and 
explicit clarification that wood is covered by import restrictions on 
archaeological organic materials. The restrictions on the importation 
of archaeological and ecclesiastical ethnological material will be in 
effect through January 14, 2029. Importation of such material of 
Bulgaria, as described in the Designated List below, will be restricted 
through that date unless the conditions set forth in 19 U.S.C. 2606 and 
19 CFR 12.104c are met.
    The Designated List includes archaeological and ecclesiastical 
ethnological material. Archaeological material ranges in date from 
approximately 1.6 million years ago through approximately A.D. 1750. 
Ecclesiastical ethnological material ranges in date from the beginning 
of the 4th century A.D. through approximately A.D. 1900. For the 
reader's convenience, CBP is reproducing the Designated List contained 
in CBP Dec. 14-01 and last revised by CBP Dec. 19-01 in its entirety, 
with the changes discussed herein.
    The list is divided into the following categories of objects:

I. Archaeological Material
    A. Stone
    B. Metal
    C. Ceramic
    D. Bone, Ivory, Horn, Wood, and other Organics
    E. Glass and Faience

    J. Mosaics--Wall mosaics generally portray religious images and 
scenes of Biblical events. Surrounding panels may contain animal, 
floral, or geometric designs. They are made from stone and glass cut 
into small bits (tesserae) and laid into a plaster matrix.

Inapplicability of Notice and Delayed Effective Date

    This rule involves a foreign affairs function of the United States 
and is, therefore, being made without notice or public procedure under 
5 U.S.C. 553(a)(1). For the same reason, a delayed effective date is 
not required under 5 U.S.C. 553(d)(3).

Executive Orders 12866 and 13563

    Executive Orders 12866 (as amended by Executive Order 14994) and 
13563 direct agencies to assess the costs and benefits of available 
regulatory alternatives and, if regulation is necessary, to select 
regulatory approaches that maximize net benefits (including potential 
economic, environmental, public health and safety effects, distributive 
impacts, and equity). Executive Order 13563 emphasizes the importance 
of quantifying both costs and benefits, of reducing costs, of 
harmonizing rules, and of promoting flexibility. CBP has determined 
that this document is not a regulation or rule subject to the 
provisions of Executive Orders 12866 and 13563 because it pertains to a 
foreign affairs function of the United States, as described above, and 
therefore is specifically exempted by section 3(d)(2) of Executive 
Order 12866 and, by extension, Executive Order 13563.

Regulatory Flexibility Act

    The Regulatory Flexibility Act (5 U.S.C. 601 et seq.), as amended 
by the Small Business Regulatory Enforcement Fairness Act of 1996, 
requires an agency to prepare and make available to the public a 
regulatory flexibility analysis that describes the effect of a proposed 
rule on small entities (i.e., small businesses, small organizations, 
and small governmental jurisdictions) when the agency is required to 
publish a general notice of proposed rulemaking for a rule. Since a 
general notice of proposed rulemaking is not necessary for this rule, 
CBP is not required to prepare a regulatory flexibility analysis for 
this rule.
