Request for Comment on Information Collection Proposal

    The Board invites public comment on the following information 
collection, which is being reviewed under authority delegated by the 
OMB under the PRA. Comments are invited on the following:
    a. Whether the proposed collection of information is necessary for 
the proper performance of the Board's functions, including whether the 
information has practical utility;
    b. The accuracy of the Board's estimate of the burden of the

    At the end of the comment period, the comments and recommendations 
received will be analyzed to determine the extent to which the Board 
should modify the proposal.

Proposal Under OMB Delegated Authority To Extend for Three Years, 
Without Revision, the Following Information Collection

    Collection title: Recordkeeping and Disclosure Requirements 
Associated with CFPB's Regulation B.
    Collection identifier: FR B.
    OMB control number: 7100-0201.
    General description of collection: The Equal Credit Opportunity Act 
(ECOA) was enacted in 1974 and is implemented by the CFPB's Regulation 
B. The ECOA prohibits discrimination in any aspect of a credit 
transaction because of race, color, religion, national origin, sex, 
marital status, age, receipt of public assistance, or the fact that the 
applicant has in good faith exercised any right under the Consumer 
Credit Protection Act. To aid in implementation of this prohibition, 
the statute and Regulation B subject creditors to various mandatory 
disclosure requirements, notification provisions informing applicants 
of action taken on credit applications, provision of appraisal reports 
in connection with mortgages, credit history reporting, monitoring 
rules, and recordkeeping requirements. The FR B is the Board's 
information collection associated with the CFPB's Regulation B for 
institutions the Board supervises.
    Frequency: Event generated and annually.
    Respondents: Except those entities supervised by the CFPB, state 
member banks; subsidiaries of state member banks; subsidiaries of bank 
holding companies; U.S. branches and agencies of foreign banks (other 
than Federal branches, Federal agencies, and insured state branches of 
foreign banks); commercial lending companies owned or controlled by 
foreign banks; and organizations operating under section 25 or 25A of 
the Federal Reserve Act.
    Total estimated number of respondents: 841.
    Total estimated annual burden hours: 81,346.

    Board of Governors of the Federal Reserve System, June 25, 2024.
Benjamin W. McDonough,
Deputy Secretary and Ombuds of the Board.
