    Section 19(b)(2)(i) of the Exchange Act \6\ provides that, within 
45 days of the publication of notice of the filing of a proposed rule 
change, the Commission shall either approve the proposed rule change, 
disapprove the proposed rule change, or institute proceedings to 
determine whether the proposed rule change should be disapproved unless 
the Commission extends the period within which it must act as provided 
in Section 19(b)(2)(ii) of the Exchange Act.\7\ Section 19(b)(2)(ii) of 
the Exchange Act allows the Commission to designate a longer period for

    The 45th day after publication of the Notice of Filing is August 
15, 2024. In order to provide the Commission with sufficient time to

appropriate to designate a longer period within which to take action on 
the Proposed Rule Change and therefore is extending this 45-day time 
period.
    Accordingly, the Commission, pursuant to Section 19(b)(2) of the 
Exchange Act,\9\ designates September 29, 2024, as the date by which 
the Commission shall either approve, disapprove, or institute 
proceedings to determine whether to disapprove proposed rule change SR-
FICC-2024-009.
