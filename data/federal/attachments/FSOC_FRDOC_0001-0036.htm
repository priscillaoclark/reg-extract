FINANCIAL STABILITY OVERSIGHT COUNCIL


Agency Information Collection Activities; Continuing Collections; 
Comment Request; Designation of Financial Market Utilities

AGENCY: Financial Stability Oversight Council.

ACTION: Notice and request for comments.

-----------------------------------------------------------------------

SUMMARY: The Financial Stability Oversight Council (the ``Council''), 
as part of its continuing effort to reduce paperwork and respondent 
burden, invites members of the public and affected agencies to comment 
on the continuing information collections listed below, as required by 
the Paperwork Reduction Act of 1995. The Council is soliciting comments 
concerning its collection of information related to its authority to 
designate financial market utilities as systemically important. Section 
804 of the Dodd-Frank Wall Street Reform and Consumer Protection Act 
(the ``Dodd-Frank Act'') provides the Council the authority to 
designate a financial market utility (``FMU'') that the Council 
determines is or is likely to become systemically important because the 
failure of or a disruption to the functioning of the FMU could create, 
or increase, the risk of significant liquidity or credit problems 
spreading among financial institutions or markets and thereby threaten 
the stability of the United States financial system.

DATES: Written comments must be received on or before February 20, 
2024.

ADDRESSES: Interested persons are invited to submit comments regarding 
this proposed collection according to the instructions below. All

timely receipt, and enables the Council to make them available to the

SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION: 
    Title: Designation of Financial Market Utilities.
    OMB Control Number: 1505-0239.
    Type of Review: Extension without change of a currently approved 
collection.
    Description: On July 27, 2011, the Council published in the Federal 
Register a final rule (12 CFR part 1320) that describes the criteria 
that will inform the Council's designation of FMUs as systemically 
important under the Dodd-Frank Act and the processes and procedures 
established under the Dodd-Frank Act for any such designation. On July 
18, 2012, the Council designated eight FMUs as systemically important 
under title VIII of the Dodd-Frank Act.
    The collection of information under 12 CFR 1320.11 affords FMUs 
that are under consideration for designation, or rescission of 
designation, an

[[Page 88619]]

opportunity to submit written materials to the Council in support of, 
or in opposition to, designation or rescission of designation. The 
collection of information under 12 CFR 1320.12 affords FMUs an 
opportunity to contest a proposed determination of the Council by 
requesting a hearing and submitting written materials (or, at the sole 
discretion of the Council, oral testimony and oral argument). The 
collection of information in 12 CFR 1320.14 affords FMUs an opportunity 
to contest the Council's waiver or modification of the notice, hearing, 
or other requirements contained in 12 CFR 1320.11 and 1320.12 by 
requesting a hearing and submitting written materials (or, at the sole 
discretion of the Council, oral testimony and oral argument). The 
information collected from FMUs under 12 CFR 1320.20 will be used by 
the Council to determine whether to designate an additional FMU or to 
rescind the designation of a designated FMU.
    Form: None.

institutions.
