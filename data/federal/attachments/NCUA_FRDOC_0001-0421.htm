SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION: 
    OMB Number: 3133-0015.
    Title: Chartering and Field of Membership Manual, 12 CFR 701.1, 
App. B to Part 701.
    Type of Review: Revision of a currently approved collection.
    Abstract: The FCU Act requires NCUA to administer chartering and 
field of membership requirements for FCUs. This is implemented through 
the Chartering and Field of Membership (Chartering) Manual as 
incorporated into NCUA regulations at 12 CFR 701.1 and Appendix B to 
Part 701. The Chartering Manual requires credit unions to prepare and 
submit forms with regard to chartering, field of membership amendments, 
service to underserved areas, and conversions from federal to state 
credit unions and state to federal credit unions.
    Affected Public: Private Sector: Not-for-profit institutions.
    Estimated Number of Respondents: 9,261.
    Estimated Number of Responses per Respondent: 1.
    Estimated Total Annual Responses: 9,261.
    Estimated Hours per Response: 2.354281395.
    Estimated Total Annual Burden Hours: 21,803.
    Reason for Change: There was an increase in the number of new 
charters, single and multiple common bond expansions, and underserved 
area applications has been steadily increasing resulting in an increase 
in burden hours.
    Request for Comments: Comments submitted in response to this notice 
will be summarized and included in the request for Office of Management 
and Budget approval. All comments will become a matter of public 
record. The public is invited to submit comments concerning: (a) 
whether the collection of information is necessary for the proper 
performance of the function of the agency, including whether the 
information will have practical utility; (b) the accuracy of the 
agency's estimate of the burden of the collection of information, 
including the validity of the methodology and assumptions used; (c) 
ways to enhance the quality, utility, and clarity of the information to 
be collected; and (d) ways to minimize the burden of the collection of 
the information on the respondents, including the use of automated 
collection techniques or other forms of information technology.

    By the National Credit Union Administration Board.
Melane Conyers-Ausbrooks,
Secretary of the Board.
