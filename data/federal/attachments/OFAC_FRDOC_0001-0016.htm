that have the purpose or effect of threatening the peace or stability 
of Iraq or the Government of Iraq, or undermining efforts to promote 
economic reconstruction and political reform in Iraq or to provide 
humanitarian assistance to the Iraqi people; (2) to have materially 
assisted, sponsored, or provided financial, material, or technical 
support for, or goods or services in support of, such an act or acts of
