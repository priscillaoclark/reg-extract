approved collection of information discussed below.
    Form 10-D is a periodic report used by asset-backed issuers to file 
distribution and pool performance information pursuant to Rule 13a-17 
(17 CFR 240.13a-17) or Rule 15d-17 (17 CFR 240.15d-17) of the 
Securities Exchange Act of 1934 (15 U.S.C. 78a et seq.). The form is 
required to be filed within 15 days after each required distribution 
date on the asset-backed securities, as specified in the governing 
documents for such securities. The information provided by Form 10-D is 
mandatory and all information is made available to the public upon 
request. Form 10-D takes approximately 39.0 hours per response to 
prepare and is filed by approximately 2,169 respondents 4.1213 times a 
year for a total of 8,939 responses. We estimate that 75% of the 39.0 
hours per response (29.25 hours) is prepared by the company for a total 
annual reporting burden of 261,466 hours (29.25 hours per response x 
8,939 responses).
    An agency may not conduct or sponsor, and a person is not required 
to respond to, a collection of information unless it displays a 
currently valid control number.
