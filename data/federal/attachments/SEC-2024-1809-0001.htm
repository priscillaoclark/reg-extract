SECURITIES AND EXCHANGE COMMISSION

[Release No. 34-101839; File No. SR-NASDAQ-2024-076]


Self-Regulatory Organizations; The Nasdaq Stock Market LLC; 
Notice of Filing and Immediate Effectiveness of Proposed Rule Change To 
Amend Certain Fees Based on the Rate of Inflation

December 6, 2024
    Pursuant to Section 19(b)(1) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 
(``Act''),\1\ and Rule 19b-4 thereunder,\2\ notice is hereby given that 
on November 26, 2024, The Nasdaq Stock Market LLC (``Nasdaq'' or 
``Exchange'') filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission 
(``Commission'') the proposed rule change as described in Items I, II, 
and III, below, which Items have been prepared by the Exchange. The 
Commission is publishing this notice to solicit comments on the 
proposed rule change from interested persons.
---------------------------------------------------------------------------

    \1\ 15 U.S.C. 78s(b)(1).
    \2\ 17 CFR 240.19b-4.
---------------------------------------------------------------------------

I. Self-Regulatory Organization's Statement of the Terms of Substance 
of the Proposed Rule Change

    The Exchange proposes to amend the Exchange's fees based on the 
rate of inflation.
    While these amendments are effective upon filing, the Exchange has 
designated the proposed amendments to be operative on January 1, 2025.
    The text of the proposed rule change is available on the Exchange's 
website at <a href="https://listingcenter.nasdaq.com/rulebook/nasdaq/rules">https://listingcenter.nasdaq.com/rulebook/nasdaq/rules</a>, at 
the principal office of the Exchange, and at the Commission's Public 
Reference Room.

II. Self-Regulatory Organization's Statement of the Purpose of, and 
Statutory Basis for, the Proposed Rule Change

    In its filing with the Commission, the Exchange included statements 
concerning the purpose of and basis for the proposed rule change and 
discussed any comments it received on the proposed rule change. The 
text of these statements may be examined at the places specified in 
Item IV below. The Exchange has prepared summaries, set forth in 
sections A, B, and C below, of the most significant aspects of such 
statements.

A. Self-Regulatory Organization's Statement of the Purpose of, and 
Statutory Basis for, the Proposed Rule Change

1. Purpose
    The purpose of the proposed rule change is to adjust market data 
fees for inflation, to be operative on January 1, 2025.\3\
---------------------------------------------------------------------------

    \3\ This proposal was initially filed on November 12, 2024, as 
SR-Nasdaq-2024-069. On November 26, 2024, SR-Nasdaq-2024, SR-Nasdaq-
2024-069 was withdrawn and replaced with the instant filing to 
provide certain additional information.
---------------------------------------------------------------------------

    Many Nasdaq market data fees have not changed for years, some for 
over 15. As such, the fees have fallen substantially in real terms. The 
Exchange proposes to restore fees to the real amount intended in the 
original filings in a one-time inflationary adjustment. This adjustment 
will become operative in three parts: 45 percent in 2025; 30 percent in 
2026; and the final 25 percent in 2027. The Exchange believes that it 
is necessary to spread the impact of this one-time adjustment for past 
inflation to prevent any undue impact that execution in a single 
tranche may have on our customers.\4\
---------------------------------------------------------------------------

    \4\ This proposal will adjust for inflation up to August 2024. 
Depending on inflation thereafter, further adjustments may, or may 
not, be necessary.
---------------------------------------------------------------------------

    The proposed fee increases will apply to ten product families 
within Nasdaq: (i) Distributor Fees; (ii) Short Interest; (iii) Depth 
of Book; (iv) Distribution Models; (v) FilterView; (vi) Nasdaq Last 
Sale; (vii) Nasdaq Share Volume; (viii) Nasdaq Basic; (ix) Daily Short 
Volume; and (x) MatchView. A detailed list of fee adjustments is set 
forth below. The Exchange is not proposing to adjust fees for non-
professional usage, administrative fees, extranet fees, or certain 
categories of Non-Display usage. The Exchange plans to use this 
inflationary adjustment to support continued investment in innovative, 
high-quality data products.
Investments in Nasdaq Data Products
    Nasdaq has continuously invested in its products in the period 
after the current fees were first instituted to accommodate the 
increasing amount of information processed and the changes in 
technology over time. It is reasonable and consistent with the Act for 
the Exchange to recoup its investments, at least in part, by adjusting 
its fees. Continuing to operate at fees frozen in time impacts the 
Exchange's ability to enhance its offerings and the interests of market 
participants and investors.
    These investments have been necessary in part because of 
significant

[[Page 100574]]

increases in the amount of information processed. The following message 
rate metrics for Nasdaq Basic illustrate this increase in throughput:

<bullet> Peak Rate by Millisecond: up approximately 141%
<bullet> Average Rate per Millisecond: up approximately 89%
<bullet> Peak Rate per Second: up approximately 25%
<bullet> Average Rate per Second: up approximately 23%
<bullet> Peak Total Messages: up approximately 209%
<bullet> Average Total Messages: up approximately 121%
<bullet> Average Daily Volume: up approximately 82%
<bullet> Maximum Message Count: up approximately 209%

    With this increase in message traffic, the Exchange expended 
significant resources to improve its market data products to meet 
customer expectations, including continued investment in all aspects of 
the technology ecosystem (e.g., software, hardware, and network). 
During the period between 2018 and 2023, advancements in system 
performance as measured by latency not only accommodated the high 
message traffic volumes but stayed well ahead of it. The following 
latency metrics \5\ illustrate the increase in message processing 
speed, despite the significant message traffic growth:
---------------------------------------------------------------------------

    \5\ These measurements compare the time difference between 
events on the matching engine and the time these events are 
published.

<bullet> Median: down approximately 22%
<bullet> Average: down approximately 28%
<bullet> Max: down approximately 29%

    The Exchange continues to invest in enhancing its technology for 
the benefit and often at the behest of its customers. Yet the Exchange 
has not adjusted any of the fees included in this proposal for many 
years (as set forth below), to even partially offset the costs of 
maintaining and enhancing its market data offerings.
Inflationary Index
    The fee increases the Exchange proposes are based on an industry-
specific Producer Price Index (PPI), which is a tailored measure of 
inflation.\6\ As a general matter, the Producer Price Index is a family 
of indexes that measures the average change over time in selling prices 
received by domestic producers of goods and services, measuring price 
change from the perspective of the seller. This contrasts with other 
metrics, such as the Consumer Price Index (CPI), that measure price 
change from the purchaser's perspective.\7\
---------------------------------------------------------------------------

    \6\ See <a href="https://fred.stlouisfed.org/series/PCU51825182#0">https://fred.stlouisfed.org/series/PCU51825182#0</a>.
    \7\ See <a href="https://www.bls.gov/ppi/overview.htm">https://www.bls.gov/ppi/overview.htm</a>.
---------------------------------------------------------------------------

    About 10,000 PPIs for individual products and groups of products 
are tracked and released each month.\8\ PPIs are available for the 
output of nearly all industries in the goods-producing sectors of the 
U.S. economy--mining, manufacturing, agriculture, fishing, and 
forestry--as well as natural gas, electricity, and construction, among 
others. The PPI program covers approximately 69 percent of the service 
sector's output, as measured by revenue reported in the 2017 Economic 
Census.
---------------------------------------------------------------------------

    \8\ See <a href="https://www.bls.gov/ppi/overview.htm">https://www.bls.gov/ppi/overview.htm</a>.
---------------------------------------------------------------------------

    For purposes of this proposal, the relevant industry-specific PPI 
is the Data Processing and Related Services PPI (``Data Processing 
PPI''), which is an industry net-output PPI that measures the average 
change in selling prices received by companies that provide data 
processing services. The Data Processing PPI was introduced in January 
2002 by the Bureau of Labor Statistics (BLS) as part of an ongoing 
effort to expand Producer Price Index coverage of the services sector 
of the U.S. economy and is identified as NAICS--518210 in the North 
American Industry Classification System.\9\ According to the BLS 
``[t]he primary output of NAICS 518210 is the provision of electronic 
data processing services. In the broadest sense, computer services 
companies help their customers efficiently use technology. The 
processing services market consists of vendors who use their own 
computer systems--often utilizing proprietary software--to process 
customers' transactions and data. Companies that offer processing 
services collect, organize, and store a customer's transactions and 
other data for record-keeping purposes. Price movements for the NAICS 
518210 index are based on changes in the revenue received by companies 
that provide data processing services. Each month, companies provide 
net transaction prices for a specified service. The transaction is an 
actual contract selected by probability, where the price-determining 
characteristics are held constant while the service is repriced. The 
prices used in index calculation are the actual prices billed for the 
selected service contract.'' \10\
---------------------------------------------------------------------------

    \9\ NAICS appears in table 5 of the PPI Detailed Report and is 
available at <a href="https://data.bls.gov/timeseries/PCU518210518210">https://data.bls.gov/timeseries/PCU518210518210</a>.
    \10\ See <a href="https://www.bls.gov/ppi/factsheets/producer-price-index-for-the-data-processing-and-related-servicesindustry-naics-518210.htm">https://www.bls.gov/ppi/factsheets/producer-price-index-for-the-data-processing-and-related-servicesindustry-naics-518210.htm</a>.
---------------------------------------------------------------------------

    The Exchange believes the Data Processing PPI is an adequate 
measure to for adjusting fees for its proprietary market data products 
because the Exchange uses its ``own computer systems'' and 
``proprietary software,'' i.e., its own data center and proprietary 
matching engine software, respectively, to collect, organize, store and 
report customers' transactions in U.S. equity securities.\11\
---------------------------------------------------------------------------

    \11\ The Exchange notes that the Bureau of Labor Statistics uses 
a number of measures of inflation that may apply to Exchange market 
data. For example, there is also an inflation measure related to PPI 
industry data for data processing, hosting, and related services: 
Hosting, ASP, and other IT infrastructure provisioning services. 
This other measure has been used by other SROs in determining price 
changes and may provide an alternative point of reference.
---------------------------------------------------------------------------

    The Exchange furthermore notes that the Data Processing PPI is a 
stable metric with limited volatility, unlike other consumer-side 
inflation metrics. The Data Processing PPI has not experienced a 
greater than 2.16% increase for any one calendar year period since Data 
Processing PPI was introduced into the PPI in January 2002. The average 
calendar year change from January 2002 to December 2023 was 0.62%, with 
a cumulative increase of 15.67% over this 21-year period.
    The Exchange notes that other exchanges have filed for increases in 
certain fees, based in part on the rate of inflation.\12\
---------------------------------------------------------------------------

    \12\ See, e.g., Securities Exchange Act Release Nos. 34-100004 
(April 22, 2024), 89 FR 32465 (April 26, 2024) (SR-CboeBYX-2024-
012); and 34-100398 (June 21, 2024), 89 FR 53676 (June 27, 2024) 
(SR-BOX-2024-16); Securities Exchange Act Release No. 100994 
(September 10, 2024), 89 FR 75612 (September 16, 2024) (SR-NYSEARCA-
2024-79).
---------------------------------------------------------------------------

Calculation and Proposed Fee Changes
    The proposed inflationary adjustments are based on a comparison of 
the Data Processing PPI index on the last date that the relevant fee 
was adjusted with the level of the Data Processing PPI index on August 
1, 2024. For example, for a fee that was last changed on September 1, 
2010, the Exchange divided the difference between the Data Processing 
PPI index on August 2024 (116.022) and the Data Processing PPI index in 
September 2010 (101.7) by the Data Processing PPI index in September 
2010 (101.7), to calculate a total inflationary adjustment of 14 
percent to obtain the percentage increase. That percentage increase was 
then applied to the prior fee to determine the proposed fee, and then 
rounding the result.\13\ This calculation was repeated for each market 
data fee.
---------------------------------------------------------------------------

    \13\ The Exchange rounded fees as follows: fee values over 
$999.99 were rounded to the nearest $10; fees between $99.99 and 
$999.99 were rounded to the nearest dollar; fees between $9.99 and 
$99.99 were rounded to the nearest $0.50; fees less than $9.99 were 
rounded to the nearest $0.10. Where rounding would have caused the 
proposed fee to exceed the rate of inflation, the Exchange rounded 
downward.

---------------------------------------------------------------------------

[[Page 100575]]

    As noted above, the Exchange proposes to adjust fees through a one-
time inflationary adjustment to be executed in three tranches: one in 
2025 that will cover 45 percent of the adjustment, another in 2026 to 
cover an additional 30 percent, and a final tranche in 2027 for the 
final 25 percent of the adjustment.
    Table 1 below shows the proposed changes for 2025, 2026 and 2027, 
the date of the last fee change, and the overall adjustment:

2. Statutory Basis
    The Exchange believes that its proposal to change fees is 
consistent

[[Page 100577]]

with Section 6(b) of the Act,\81\ in general, and furthers the 
objectives of Sections 6(b)(4) and 6(b)(5) of the Act,\82\ in 
particular, in that it provides for the equitable allocation of 
reasonable dues, fees and other charges among members and issuers and 
other persons using any facility, and is not designed to permit unfair 
discrimination between customers, issuers, brokers, or dealers.

---------------------------------------------------------------------------

    This belief is based on two factors. First, the current fees do not 
properly reflect the quality of the services and products, as fees for 
the services and products in question have been static in nominal 
terms, and therefore falling in real terms due to inflation. Second, 
the Exchange believes that investments made in enhancing the capacity 
of Exchange systems have increased the performance of the services and 
products notwithstanding fees having remained static in nominal terms.
Equitable Allocation of Reasonable Dues, Fees and Other Charges
    The proposed changes are an equitable allocation of reasonable 
dues, fees, and other charges because, as noted above, the Exchange has 
not increased any of the fees included in the proposal since the dates 
indicated in Table 1. In the years following the last fee increase, the 
Exchange has made significant investments in upgrades to Exchange 
systems and enhancing the quality of its services as measured by, among 
other things, increased throughput. As such, Exchange customers have 
benefitted while the Exchange's ability to recoup its investments has 
been hampered, and Exchange fees have fallen in real terms during the 
relevant period.
    Between 2018 and 2023, for example, the overall inflation rate was 
an average of 3.93% per year, producing a cumulative inflation rate of 
21.28%.\83\ Using the more targeted inflation number of Data Processing 
PPI, the cumulative inflation rate was 8.07%.\84\ The Exchange believes 
the Data Processing PPI is a reasonable metric for this fee increase 
because it is targeted to producer-side increases in the data 
processing industry, which, based on the definition adopted by BLS, 
would include the Exchange's market data products. Notwithstanding this 
inflation, the Exchange has not increased its fees for the subject 
services for the period of time indicated in Table 1, and therefore the 
proposed fee changes represent a reasonable increase from the current 
fees.
---------------------------------------------------------------------------

    \83\ See <a href="https://www.officialdata.org/us/inflation/2019?endYear=2023&amount=1">https://www.officialdata.org/us/inflation/2019?endYear=2023&amount=1</a>.

---------------------------------------------------------------------------

    The Exchange believes the proposed fee increase is reasonable in 
light of the Exchange's continued expenditure in maintaining a robust 
technology ecosystem. The Exchange continues to invest in maintaining 
and enhancing its market data products for the benefit and often at the 
behest of its customers and global investors. Such enhancements include 
refreshing all aspects of the technology ecosystem including software, 
hardware, and network while introducing new and innovative products. 
The goal of these enhancements, among other things, is to provide 
faster and more consistent market data products. The Exchange continues 
to expend resources to innovate and modernize technology so that it may 
benefit its members in offering its market data products.
The Proposal Does Not Permit Unfair Discrimination
    The proposed fee increases are not unfairly discriminatory because 
they would apply to all data recipients that choose to purchase the 
market data products identified above. Any person that chooses to 
purchase any of these products would be subject to the same fee 
schedule, regardless of what type of business they operate or the use 
they plan to make of the data feed. Additionally, the fee increase 
would be applied uniformly to subscribers without regard to Exchange 
membership status or the extent of any other business with the Exchange 
or affiliated entities.
    The proposed changes are also not unfairly discriminatory because 
the fees would be assessed uniformly across all market participants 
that purchase these products in the same manner they are today, and all 
products will remain available for purchase by all market participants.

B. Self-Regulatory Organization's Statement on Burden on Competition

    The Exchange does not believe that the proposed rule change will 
impose any burden on competition not necessary or appropriate in 
furtherance of the purposes of the Act.
Intramarket Competition
    The proposed fees do not put any market participants at a relative 
disadvantage compared to other market participants. As noted above, the 
fee schedule would continue to apply to all customers of the market 
data products identified above in the same manner as it does today, 
albeit at inflation-adjusted rates for certain fees, and customers may 
choose whether to subscribe to the feed at all. The Exchange also 
believes that the level of the proposed fees neither favors nor 
penalizes any one or more categories of market participants in a manner 
that would impose an undue burden on competition.
Intermarket Competition
    The proposed fees do not impose a burden on competition or on other 
Self Regulatory Organizations that is not necessary or appropriate. In 
determining the proposed fees, the Exchange utilized an objective and 
stable metric with limited volatility. Utilizing Data Processing PPI 
over a specified period of time is a reasonable means of recouping the 
Exchange's investment in maintaining and enhancing the market data 
products identified above. The Exchange believes utilizing Data 
Processing PPI, a tailored measure of inflation, to increase certain 
market data fees to recoup the Exchange's investment in maintaining and 
enhancing its market data products would not impose a burden on 
competition.
