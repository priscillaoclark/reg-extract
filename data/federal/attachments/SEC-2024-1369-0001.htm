SECURITIES AND EXCHANGE COMMISSION

[Release No. 34-101109; File No. SR-NYSE-2024-55]


Self-Regulatory Organizations; New York Stock Exchange LLC; 
Notice of Filing and Immediate Effectiveness of Proposed Rule Change To 
Amend the NYSE Proprietary Market Data Fee Schedule To Establish an 
Access Fee for the NYSE Pillar Depth Data Feed

September 19, 2024.
    Pursuant to Section 19(b)(1) \1\ of the Securities Exchange Act of 
1934 (``Act'') \2\ and Rule 19b-4 thereunder,\3\ notice is hereby given 
that, on September 6, 2024, New York Stock Exchange LLC (``NYSE'' or 
the ``Exchange'') filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission 
(the ``Commission'') the proposed rule change as described in Items I 
and II below, which Items have been prepared by the self-regulatory 
organization. The Commission is publishing this notice to solicit 
comments on the proposed rule change from interested persons.

I. Self-Regulatory Organization's Statement of the Terms of Substance 
of the Proposed Rule Change

    The Exchange proposes to amend the NYSE Proprietary Market Data Fee 
Schedule to establish an Access Fee for the NYSE Pillar Depth data 
feed. The proposed rule change is available on the Exchange's website 
at <a href="http://www.nyse.com">www.nyse.com</a>, at the principal office of the Exchange, and at the 
Commission's Public Reference Room.

II. Self-Regulatory Organization's Statement of the Purpose of, and 
Statutory Basis for, the Proposed Rule Change

    In its filing with the Commission, the self-regulatory organization 
included statements concerning the purpose of, and basis for, the 
proposed rule change and discussed any comments it received on the 
proposed rule change. The text of those statements may be examined at 
the places specified in Item IV below. The Exchange has prepared 
summaries, set forth in sections A, B, and C below, of the most 
significant parts of such statements.

A. Self-Regulatory Organization's Statement of the Purpose of, and the 
Statutory Basis for, the Proposed Rule Change

1. Purpose
    The Exchange proposes to amend the NYSE Proprietary Market Data Fee 
Schedule (``Fee Schedule''). Specifically, the Exchange proposes to 
establish an Access Fee for the NYSE Pillar Depth (``Pillar Depth'') 
data feed, effective September 6, 2024.\4\
---------------------------------------------------------------------------

    \4\ The Exchange originally filed to amend the Fee Schedule on 
May 13, 2024 (SR-NYSE-2024-30). On July 11, 2024, the Exchange 
withdrew SR-NYSE-2024 30 and replaced it with SR-NYSE-2024-39. On 
September 6, 2024, the Exchange withdrew SR-NYSE-2024-39 and 
replaced it with this filing.
---------------------------------------------------------------------------

    The proposed fee for Pillar Depth would be $250 per month, provided 
that the market data recipient separately pays the applicable fees for 
the five existing market data products underlying the Pillar Depth data 
feed, consistent with the existing fee structures for those market data 
products.
    The Pillar Depth data feed is a frequency-based depth of book 
market data feed that provides a consolidated view of the ten (10) best 
price levels on both the bid and offer sides across the NYSE Group's 
combined limit order books for securities traded on the NYSE Group 
equities markets, i.e., NYSE, NYSE American LLC (``NYSE American''), 
NYSE Arca, Inc. (``NYSE Arca''), NYSE Chicago, Inc. (``NYSE Chicago'') 
and NYSE National, Inc. (``NYSE National''), for which the NYSE Group 
equities markets report quotes and trades under the Consolidated Tape 
Association (``CTA'') Plan or the Nasdaq/UTP Plan.\5\ In other words, 
Pillar Depth would be a compilation of limit order data that the 
Exchange provides to vendors and subscribers, updated no less 
frequently than once per second. Specifically, the Pillar Depth data 
feed consists of certain data elements from five market data feeds 
\6\--NYSE Aggregated Lite,\7\ NYSE American Aggregated Lite,\8\ NYSE 
Arca Aggregated Lite,\9\ NYSE Chicago Aggregated Lite \10\ and NYSE 
National Aggregated Lite.\11\
---------------------------------------------------------------------------

    \5\ See Securities Exchange Act Release No. 100030 (April 25, 
2024), 89 FR 35260 (May 1, 2024) (Notice of Filing and Immediate 
Effectiveness of Proposed Rule Change To Establish the NYSE Pillar 
Depth Data Feed) (SR-NYSE-2024-24) (``Pillar Depth Product 
Filing'').
    \6\ Each of these data feeds are offered pursuant to preexisting 
and effective rules and fees filed with the Commission. This filing 
does not affect those rules, or the fees associated with these 
underlying data feeds or the ability for the Exchange, NYSE 
American, NYSE Arca, NYSE Chicago or NYSE National to amend the data 
feeds or fees associated with those data feeds pursuant to a 
separate rule filing.

Effectiveness of Proposed Rule Change To Establish the NYSE 
Aggregated Lite Market Data Feed) (SR-NYSE-2024-12).

Effectiveness of Proposed Rule Change To Establish the NYSE American 
Aggregated Lite Market Data Feed) (SR-NYSEAMER-2024-14).
    \9\ See Securities Exchange Act Release No. 99713 (March 12,

2024) 89 FR 18468 (March 13, 2024) (Notice of Filing and Immediate 
Effectiveness of Proposed Rule Change To Establish the NYSE Chicago 
Aggregated Lite Market Data Feed) (SR-NYSECHX-2024-08).

Aggregated Lite Market Data Feed) (SR-NYSENAT-2024-06).

---------------------------------------------------------------------------

[[Page 78365]]

    The Exchange, NYSE American, NYSE Arca, NYSE Chicago and NYSE 
National are the exclusive distributors of the five Aggregated Lite 
feeds from which certain data elements are taken to create the Pillar 
Depth data feed. By contrast, the Exchange would not be the exclusive 
distributor of the aggregated and consolidated information that 
comprises the Pillar Depth data feed. Any entity that receives, or 
elects to receive, the five underlying Aggregated Lite data feeds would 
be able, if it so chooses, to create a data feed with the same 
information included in Pillar Depth and sell and distribute it to its 
clients so that it could be received by those clients as quickly as the 
Pillar Depth data feed would be received by those same clients.\12\
---------------------------------------------------------------------------

    \12\ See Pillar Depth Product Filing, supra note 5.
---------------------------------------------------------------------------

    As proposed, the Exchange would charge a $250 per month Access Fee 
for the aggregation and consolidation function that the Exchange 
performs in creating Pillar Depth. To obtain Pillar Depth, a market 
data recipient would need to pay any applicable fees for the five data 
feeds underlying Pillar Depth, consistent with the existing fee 
schedules for those market data products as previously filed with the 
Commission and which may be amended from time to time, including any 
applicable Access, Redistribution, Professional User, Non-Professional 
User, Non-Display or Enterprise fees. The Exchange proposes to denote 
the requirement for market data recipients to pay the applicable fees 
for the five data feeds underlying Pillar Depth in proposed footnote 3 
on the Fee Schedule.
    When subscribing to Pillar Depth, the underlying data feeds would 
be delivered in the Pillar Depth consolidated format, as described 
above, but charged for as if the recipient were receiving the 
underlying feeds directly. The Exchange notes that if a subscriber 
chooses to receive the five underlying feeds both separately and in the 
Pillar Depth format, such subscriber may be subject to additional 
Professional User or Non-Professional User fees to reflect the 
distribution of both Pillar Depth (which incorporates the five 
underlying data feeds) and any separate dissemination of the underlying 
data feeds. The Exchange believes that the proposed fees for Pillar 
Depth would not be lower than the cost to a vendor of creating a 
comparable product, including the cost of receiving the underlying data 
feeds.
    The Exchange notes that another market participant seeking to 
distribute a competing product to Pillar Depth might engage in a 
different analysis of assessing the cost of a competing product, which 
may incorporate passing through fees associated with co-location at the 
Mahwah, New Jersey data center. However, the incremental co-location 
cost to a particular vendor might be inconsequential if such vendor is 
already co-located and is able to allocate its co-location costs over 
numerous product and customer relationships. The Exchange therefore 
believes that a vendor could create and offer a product similar to 
Pillar Depth on a cost-competitive basis.
    The proposed rule change is intended to encourage market 
participants to subscribe to Pillar Depth by making it more affordable 
for prospective customers. The proposed fee change would allow the 
Exchange to compete more effectively with the Cboe One Premium Feed, 
which as described below, is a comparable market data offering to 
Pillar Depth.
    The Exchange notes that the proposed change is not otherwise 
intended to address any other issues, and the Exchange is not aware of 
any problems that member organizations or others would have in 
complying with the proposed rule change.
2. Statutory Basis
    The Exchange believes that the proposed rule change is consistent 
with the provisions of Section 6 of the Act,\13\ in general, and 
Sections 6(b)(4) and 6(b)(5) of the Act,\14\ in particular, in that it 
provides an equitable allocation of reasonable fees among users and 
recipients of the data and is not designed to permit unfair 
discrimination among customers, issuers, and brokers. The Exchange also 
believes that the proposed rule change is consistent with Section 11(A) 
of the Act \15\ in that it is consistent with (i) fair competition 
among brokers and dealers, among exchange markets, and between exchange 
markets and markets other than exchange markets; and (ii) the 
availability to brokers, dealers, and investors of information with 
respect to quotations for and transactions in securities. Furthermore, 
the proposed rule change is consistent with Rule 603 of Regulation 
NMS,\16\ which provides that any national securities exchange that 
distributes information with respect to quotations for or transactions 
in an NMS stock do so on terms that are not unreasonably 
discriminatory.

---------------------------------------------------------------------------

The Proposed Rule Change Is Reasonable
    In adopting Regulation NMS, the Commission granted SROs and broker-
dealers increased authority and flexibility to offer new and unique 
market data to the public. The Commission has repeatedly expressed its 
preference for competition over regulatory intervention in determining 
prices, products, and services in the securities markets. Specifically, 
in Regulation NMS, the Commission highlighted the importance of market 
forces in determining prices and SRO revenues, and also recognized that 
current regulation of the market system ``has been remarkably 
successful in promoting market competition in its broader forms that 
are most important to investors and listed companies.'' \17\
---------------------------------------------------------------------------

    \17\ See Regulation NMS Adopting Release, 70 FR 37495, at 37499.
---------------------------------------------------------------------------

    With respect to market data, the decision of the United States 
Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia Circuit in NetCoalition 
v. SEC upheld the Commission's reliance on the existence of competitive 
market mechanisms to evaluate the reasonableness and fairness of fees 
for proprietary market data:

    In fact, the legislative history indicates that the Congress 
intended that the market system ``evolve through the interplay of 
competitive forces as unnecessary regulatory restrictions are 
removed'' and that the SEC wield its regulatory power ``in those 
situations where competition may not be sufficient,'' such as in the 
creation of a ``consolidated transactional reporting system.'' \18\
---------------------------------------------------------------------------

    \18\ NetCoalition v. SEC, 615 F.3d 525, 535 (D.C. Cir. 2010) 
(``NetCoalition I'') (quoting H.R. Rep. No. 94-229 at 92 (1975), as 
reprinted in 1975 U.S.C.C.A.N. 323).

    The court agreed with the Commission's conclusion that ``Congress 
intended that `competitive forces should dictate the services and 
practices that constitute the U.S. national market system for trading 
equity securities.' '' \19\
---------------------------------------------------------------------------

    \19\ Id. at 535.
---------------------------------------------------------------------------

    More recently, the Commission confirmed that it applies a ``market-
based'' test in its assessment of market data fees, and that under that 
test:

the Commission considers whether the exchange was subject to 
significant competitive forces in setting the terms of its proposal 
for [market data], including the level of any fees. If an exchange 
meets this burden, the Commission will find that its fee rule is 
consistent with the Act unless there

[[Page 78366]]

is a substantial countervailing basis to find that the terms of the 
rule violate the Act or the rules thereunder.\20\
---------------------------------------------------------------------------

    \20\ See Securities Exchange Act Release No. 34-90217 (October 
16, 2020), 85 FR 67392 (October 22, 2020) (SR-NYSENAT-2020-05) 
(``National IF Approval Order'') (internal quotation marks omitted), 
quoting Securities Exchange Act Release No. 59039 (December 2, 
2008), 73 FR 74770, 74781 (December 9, 2008) (``2008 ArcaBook 
Approval Order'').

    As discussed below, the Exchange believes that its proposed fees 
are constrained by competitive forces.
    As the D.C. Circuit recognized in NetCoalition I, ``[n]o one 
disputes that competition for order flow is fierce.'' \21\ The court 
further noted that ``no exchange possesses a monopoly, regulatory or 
otherwise, in the execution of order flow from broker dealers,'' and 
that an exchange ``must compete vigorously for order flow to maintain 
its share of trading volume.'' \22\
---------------------------------------------------------------------------

    \22\ Id.
---------------------------------------------------------------------------

    As noted above, while Regulation NMS has enhanced competition, it 
has also fostered a ``fragmented'' market structure where trading in a 
single stock can occur across multiple trading centers. When multiple 
trading centers compete for order flow in the same stock, the 
Commission has recognized that ``such competition can lead to the 
fragmentation of order flow in that stock.'' \23\ Indeed, today, equity 
trading is currently dispersed across 16 exchanges,\24\ numerous 
alternative trading systems,\25\ broker-dealer internalizers and 
wholesalers, all competing for order flow. Based on publicly-available 
information, no single exchange currently has more than 20% market 
share.\26\

    Further, low barriers to entry mean that new exchanges may rapidly 
and inexpensively enter the market to compete with the Exchange. For 
example, since 2020, three new ones have entered the market: Long Term 
Stock Exchange (LTSE), which began operations as an exchange on August 
28, 2020; \27\ Members Exchange (MEMX), which began operations as an 
exchange on September 29, 2020; \28\ and Miami International Holdings 
(MIAX), which began operations of its first equities exchange on 
September 29, 2020.\29\

---------------------------------------------------------------------------

    More specifically, in setting fees for the Pillar Depth data feed, 
the Exchange is constrained by the fact that, if its pricing is 
unattractive to customers, customers have their pick of alternatives to 
purchase similar data from instead of purchasing it from the Exchange. 
The existence of alternatives to the Exchange's data product ensures 
that the Exchange cannot set unreasonable market data fees without 
suffering the negative effects of that decision in the fiercely 
competitive market for proprietary partial depth of book market data.
    The Exchange further believes that requiring market data recipients 
to separately pay for the five underlying data feeds to Pillar Depth is 
reasonable because by design, Pillar Depth represents an aggregated and 
consolidated version of those existing five data feeds. The Exchange 
notes that it is not seeking with this filing to establish fees 
relating to the underlying five Aggregated Lite data feeds, as those 
fees have been established consistent with Section 19(b)(3)(A) of the 
Act \30\ and Rule 19b-4(f)(2) \31\ thereunder, and which may be amended 
from time to time. However, the Exchange believes it would be unfair if 
it did not require Pillar Depth data feed recipients to separately pay 
for those five feeds because otherwise, Pillar Depth data feed 
recipients would be receiving a data product that includes such 
underlying data at a lower cost than separately subscribing to the 
underlying data feeds. Similarly, the Exchange believes that it would 
be reasonable to charge separate Professional User or Non-Professional 
User fees if a market data recipient chooses to receive both Pillar 
Depth and a separate dissemination of the five underlying data feeds in 
a non-consolidated form. The Exchange believes that such delivery would 
constitute two separate uses of the underlying data feeds and thus 
should be charged accordingly, consistent with the existing fee 
schedule for those market data products. The Exchange therefore 
believes that the proposed fee structure for Pillar Depth would not be 
lower than the cost to another party to create a comparable product, 
including the cost of receiving the underlying data feeds.

---------------------------------------------------------------------------

    The Exchange notes that its proposed fee structure is similar to 
the fee structure for the NYSE BQT data feed.\32\ The NYSE BQT data 
feed provides best bid and offer (``BBO'') and last sale information 
(``Trades'') for the Exchange and its affiliates, NYSE Arca, NYSE 
American, NYSE Chicago and NYSE National. NYSE BQT consists of certain 
data elements from ten market data feeds--NYSE Trades, NYSE BBO, NYSE 
Arca Trades, NYSE Arca BBO, NYSE American Trades, NYSE American BBO, 
NYSE Chicago Trades, NYSE Chicago BBO, NYSE National Trades and NYSE 
National BBO.\33\ To receive NYSE BQT, a market data recipient must pay 
the applicable fee for the ten data feeds underlying NYSE BQT, and an 
Access Fee of $250 per month.\34\
---------------------------------------------------------------------------

    \32\ See Securities Exchange Act Release No. 73816 (December 11,

order--NYSE BQT) (SR-NYSE-2014-40) (``NYSE BQT Filing''). In 2018, 
NYSE BQT was amended to include NYSE National BBO and NYSE National 
Trades. See Securities Exchange Act Release No. 83359 (June 1, 
2018), 83 FR 26507 (June 7, 2018) (SR-NYSE-2018-22). In 2019, NYSE 
BQT was amended to include NYSE Chicago BBO and NYSE Chicago Trades. 
See Securities Exchange Act Release No. 87511 (November 12, 2019), 
84 FR 63689 (November 18, 2019) (SR-NYSE-2019-60).

for NYSE BBO and NYSE Trades To Lower the Enterprise Fee, and for 
NYSE BQT To Lower the Access Fee) (SR-NYSE-2017-60).
---------------------------------------------------------------------------

    The Exchange notes that Pillar Depth is entirely optional. The 
Exchange is not required to make Pillar Depth available to any 
customers, nor is any customer required to purchase the Pillar Depth 
data feed. Unlike some other data products (e.g., the consolidated 
quotation and last-sale information feeds) that firms are required to 
purchase in order to fulfil regulatory obligations,\35\ a customer's 
decision

[[Page 78367]]

whether to purchase Pillar Depth is entirely discretionary. The 
Exchange believes that Pillar Depth would provide high-quality, 
comprehensive partial depth of book data for the Exchange, NYSE Arca, 
NYSE American, NYSE Chicago and NYSE National in a unified view that an 
anticipated end user might use for purposes of identifying an 
indicative price of Tape A, B and C securities through leveraging the 
depth and breadth of NYSE, NYSE Arca, NYSE American, NYSE Chicago and 
NYSE National without having to purchase consolidated data and thus it 
would not be a latency-sensitive product. The Exchange does not 
anticipate that an end user would, or could, use Pillar Depth data for 
purposes of making order-routing or trading decisions. Firms that 
choose to subscribe to Pillar Depth are able to determine for 
themselves whether Pillar Depth is necessary for their business needs, 
and if so, whether or not it is attractively priced. If Pillar Depth 
does not provide sufficient benefit to firms based on the uses those 
firms may have for it, such firms may simply choose to conduct their 
business operations in ways that do not use Pillar Depth.
---------------------------------------------------------------------------

    \35\ The Exchange notes that broker-dealers are not required to 
purchase proprietary market data to comply with their best execution 
obligations. See In the Matter of the Application of Securities 
Industry and Financial Markets Association for Review of Actions 
Taken by Self-Regulatory Organizations, Release Nos. 34-72182; AP-3-
15350; AP-3-15351 (May 16, 2014). Similarly, there is no requirement 
in Regulation NMS or any other rule that proprietary data be 
utilized for order routing decisions, and some broker-dealers and 
ATSs have chosen not to do so.
---------------------------------------------------------------------------

    In setting the proposed fees for Pillar Depth, the Exchange 
considered the competitiveness of the market for proprietary data for 
partial depth of book and all of the implications of that competition. 
The Exchange believes that it has considered all relevant factors and 
has not considered irrelevant factors in order to establish reasonable 
fees. The proposed fees are therefore reasonable because in setting 
them, the Exchange is constrained by the availability of substitute 
partial depth of book market data products. The Commission has been 
clear that such substitutes need not be identical, but only 
substantially similar to the product at hand.\36\
---------------------------------------------------------------------------

    \36\ For example, in the National IF Approval Order, the 
Commission recognized that for some customers, the best bid and 
offer information from consolidated data feeds may function as a 
substitute for the NYSE National Integrated Feed product, which 
contains order by order information. See National IF Approval Order, 
supra note 20, at 67397 [release p. 21] (``[I]nformation provided by 
NYSE National demonstrates that a number of executing broker-dealers 
do not subscribe to the NYSE National Integrated Feed and executing 
broker-dealers can otherwise obtain NYSE National best bid and offer 
information from the consolidated data feeds.'' (internal quotations 
omitted)).

Similar to the Cboe One Premium Feed, Pillar Depth can be utilized by 
vendors and subscribers to quickly access and distribute aggregated 
order book data. As noted above, Pillar Depth, similar to Cboe One 
Premium Feed, would provide aggregated depth per security, including 
the bid, ask and share quantity for orders received by the NYSE Group 
markets. The Exchange believes that Pillar Depth will offer a 
competitive alternative to the Cboe One Premium Feed.\38\
---------------------------------------------------------------------------

    \37\ See BZX Rule 11.22(j); BYX Rule 11.22(i); EDGA Rule 
13.8(b); and EDGX Rule 13.8(b). The Cboe One Feed offered by BZX, 
BYX, EDGA and EDGX is a data feed that contains the aggregate best 
bid and offer of all displayed orders for securities traded on the 
Cboe exchanges. The Cboe One Feed also contains the individual last 
sale information, consolidated volume, the primary listing market's 
official opening and closing price, and the current day consolidated 
high and low price for all listed equity securities. Cboe One Feed 
recipients may also elect to receive aggregated two-sided quotations 
from the Cboe exchanges for five (5) price levels (``Cboe One 
Premium Feed'').
    \38\ Fees for the Cboe One Premium Feed are available at <a href="https://www.cboe.com/market_data_services/us/equities/cboe_one/">https://www.cboe.com/market_data_services/us/equities/cboe_one/</a>.
---------------------------------------------------------------------------

    The fees that are the subject of this rule filing are constrained 
by competition. As explained below in the Exchange's Statement on 
Burden on Competition, the existence of alternatives to these data 
products further ensures that the Exchange cannot set unreasonable 
fees, or fees that are unreasonably discriminatory, when vendors and 
subscribers can elect such alternatives. That is, the Exchange competes 
with other exchanges (and their affiliates) that provide similar market 
data products. If another exchange (or its affiliate) were to charge 
less to consolidate and distribute its similar product than the 
Exchange charges to consolidate and distribute Pillar Depth, 
prospective users likely would not subscribe to, or would cease 
subscribing to, Pillar Depth.
The Proposed Fees Are Equitably Allocated and Are Not Unfairly 
Discriminatory
    The Exchange believes that the proposed fee is equitable and non-
discriminatory in that it would apply uniformly to all recipients of 
Exchange data. The Exchange also believes the proposed fee is 
competitive with those charged by other venues and, therefore, 
reasonable and equitably allocated to recipients. The Exchange also 
notes that the proposed fee is not designed to permit unfair 
discrimination because all market data recipients that subscribe to 
Pillar Depth would be charged the same fee. The Exchange further 
believes that the proposed Pillar Depth fee structure is equitable and 
not unfairly discriminatory because all vendors and subscribers that 
elect to purchase Pillar Depth would be charged the same fees. In 
addition, vendors and subscribers that do not wish to purchase Pillar 
Depth may separately purchase the five individual underlying products, 
and if they so choose, perform a similar aggregation and consolidation 
function that the Exchange performs in creating Pillar Depth. To enable 
such competition, the Exchange is offering Pillar Depth on terms that a 
subscriber of those five feeds could offer a competing product if it so 
chooses.
    For these reasons, the Exchange believes that the proposed fees are 
reasonable, equitable, and not unfairly discriminatory.

B. Self-Regulatory Organization's Statement on Burden on Competition

    In accordance with Section 6(b)(8) \39\ of the Act, the Exchange 
does not believe that the proposed rule change will impose any burden 
on competition that is not necessary or appropriate in furtherance of 
the purposes of the Act. As noted above, the Pillar Depth data feed 
represents aggregated and consolidated information from five existing 
market data feeds. Although the Exchange, NYSE American, NYSE Arca, 
NYSE Chicago and NYSE National are the exclusive distributors of the 
five Aggregated Lite data feeds from which certain data elements are 
taken to create Pillar Depth, the Exchange may not be the exclusive 
distributor of the aggregated and consolidated information that 
comprises the Pillar Depth data feed. Any other market participant 
recipient of the five Aggregated Lite feeds would be able, if it chose, 
to create a data feed with the same information as Pillar Depth and 
distribute it to their clients on a level-playing field with respect to 
latency and cost as compared to the Exchange's product.\40\

---------------------------------------------------------------------------

    Intramarket Competition. The Exchange believes that the proposed 
fees do not put any market participant at a relative disadvantage 
compared to other market participant. As noted above, the proposed fees 
would apply equally to all subscribers of Pillar

[[Page 78368]]

Depth, and subscribers may choose whether to subscribe to Pillar Depth 
at all. The Exchange also believes that the proposed fees neither favor 
nor penalize one or more categories of market participants in a manner 
that would impose an undue market on competition.
    Intermarket Competition. The Exchange believes that the proposed 
monthly Access Fee the Exchange proposes to charge subscribers for 
Pillar Depth would be pro-competitive because another market data 
recipient could perform a similar aggregating and consolidating 
function and similarly charge for such service. The Exchange notes that 
a competing vendor might engage in a different analysis of assessing 
the cost of a competing product, which may incorporate passing through 
fees associated with co-location at the Mahwah, New Jersey data center. 
However, the incremental co-location costs to a particular vendor may 
be inconsequential if such vendor is already co-located and is able to 
allocate its co-location costs over numerous product and customer 
relationships. The Exchange therefore believes that a competing vendor 
could create and offer a product similar to the Pillar Depth data feed 
at a similar cost. For these reasons, the Exchange believes that 
vendors could readily offer a product similar to Pillar Depth on a 
competitive basis.
    Specifically, the Exchange believes that the proposed fees do not 
impose a burden on competition or on other exchanges that is not 
necessary or appropriate because of the availability of substitute 
partial depth of book market data products. As described above, Pillar 
Depth would compete with the Cboe One Premium Feed.\41\ These products 
each serve as reasonable substitutes for one another as they are each 
designed to provide investors with a unified view of quotes in all Tape 
A, B, and C securities. Each product provides subscribers with 
aggregated and consolidated quotes from multiple U.S. equities markets. 
Pillar Depth provides partial depth of book data from five NYSE-
affiliated U.S. equities exchanges, while Cboe One Premium Feed 
similarly provides partial depth of book data from Cboe's four U.S. 
equities exchanges. Pillar Depth and Cboe One Premium Feed are intended 
to provide indicative pricing and therefore, are reasonable substitutes 
for one another. In setting the fee for the Pillar Depth, the Exchange 
is constrained by the fact that if its pricing is unattractive, 
customers will have their pick of alternative partial depth of book 
market data products to purchase instead of purchasing the Exchange's 
product. Because market data users can find suitable substitute feeds, 
an exchange that overprices its market data products stands a high risk 
that users may substitute another source of market data information for 
its own. These competitive pressures ensure that no one exchange's 
market data fees can impose an unnecessary burden on competition, and 
the Exchange's proposed fees do not do so here.
---------------------------------------------------------------------------

    \41\ See supra, note 37.
---------------------------------------------------------------------------

    As such, in establishing the proposed fees, the Exchange considered 
the competitiveness of the market for proprietary partial depth of book 
data and all of the implications of that competition. The Exchange 
believes that it has considered all relevant factors and has not 
considered irrelevant factors in order to establish fair, reasonable, 
and not unreasonably discriminatory fees and an equitable allocation of 
fees among all users. The existence of alternatives to Pillar Depth, 
including the five underlying feeds, consolidated data, and proprietary 
data from other sources, ensures that the Exchange cannot set 
unreasonable fees, or fees that are unreasonably discriminatory, when 
vendors and subscribers can elect these alternatives or choose not to 
purchase a specific proprietary data product if its cost to purchase is 
not justified by the returns any particular vendor or subscriber would 
achieve through the purchase.
