SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION: 
    OMB Number: 3133-0204.
    Title: NCUA Profile--NCUA Form 4501A.
    Type of Review: Revision of a currently approved collection.
    Abstract: Sections 106 and 202 of the Federal Credit Union Act 
require federally insured credit unions to make financial reports to 
the NCUA. Section 741.6 requires insured credit unions to submit a 
Credit Union Profile (NCUA Form 4501A) and update the Profile within 10 
days of election or appointment of senior management or volunteer 
officials or 30 days of other changes in Program information. The NCUA 
website further directs credit unions to review and certify their 
Profiles every Call Report cycle. Credit union information collected 
through the Profile is essential to the NCUA supervision of federal 
credit unions and facilitates the NCUA monitoring of other credit 
unions with share accounts insured by the National Credit Union Share 
Insurance Fund (NCUSIF).

Form 4501A Credit Union Profile--Proposed Changes and Comments Received

    In the July 26, 2024 notice,\1\ the NCUA proposed revisions to the 
Profile (Form 4501A) including revisions to the General Information, 
Contacts & Roles, Sites, Payment Systems Service Provider Information, 
Information Technology, Grants, and Merger Partner Registry tabs. The 
comment period for the July 2024 notice ended on September 24, 2024. 
The NCUA received ten comment letters, four of which were irrelevant or 
did not apply to the actual information collection.
---------------------------------------------------------------------------

    \1\ 89 FR 60662 (July 26, 2024).
---------------------------------------------------------------------------

General Information Tab

    The NCUA proposed to collect the name of the credit union's anti-
money laundering (AML) monitoring system and separated the question 
relating to the credit union's field of membership from the Minority 
Depository Institution (MDI) question relating to current members. The 
NCUA also updated the instructions for the General Information tab to 
reflect these changes.
    Two commenters objected to the reporting of the name of the credit 
union's automated AML monitoring system because the information can be 
collected during an examination. Three commenters objected to the 
public release of this information.
    The NCUA concedes this information can be obtained during an 
examination. However, if the NCUA had this information beforehand, it 
would enable the agency to align the assigned examiner's skillset when 
reviewing the AML monitoring system with the credit union's program. 
The NCUA can also tailor their training programs to address specific 
AML monitoring systems.
    As with all information on the Profile, the AML monitoring system 
must be disclosed only once, then would be pre-populated every quarter. 
Unless the monitoring system changes, the credit union would not need 
to report this every quarter. Also, as discussed in the Other Comments 
Received section, system information collected on the Profile will not 
be publicly released. After consideration of these comments, the NCUA 
will proceed with the proposed changes.

Contacts & Roles Tab

    The NCUA proposed to add indicators for the email address that 
officials want to use to receive confidential credit union 
correspondence. The NCUA also updated the instructions for the Contact 
& Roles tab to reflect this change.
    One commenter objected to receiving confidential correspondence via 
email. The NCUA revised the Profile and changed the indicators to the 
preferred email address. The NCUA also updated the instructions to 
reflect this change. Credit unions can use one of the checkboxes to 
indicate the official's preferred email address. Although the NCUA's 
Secure File Transfer Portal (SFTP) may be used to share confidential 
correspondence, when the NCUA or the state supervisory authority shares 
confidential or other types of correspondence using the SFTP, the 
recipient receives an email notifying them that items are available in 
the SFTP. Asking the credit union to identify the official's preferred 
email address will ensure the NCUA is contacting the official using the 
preferred method. Besides this comment, the NCUA did not receive any

[[Page 83910]]

comments and will proceed with these changes.

Sites Tab

    The NCUA proposed adding an indicator for credit unions that 
operate exclusively online and adding Interactive Teller Machines (ITM) 
to the Public Site Functions. The NCUA also updated the instructions 
for the Sites tab to reflect these changes. No comments related to 
these changes were received, so the NCUA will proceed with these 
changes.

Payment System Service Provider Information Tab

    The NCUA proposed adding, removing, or relocating items as noted in 
the July 26, 2024, Federal Register Notice. One commenter objected to 
the NCUA extending the timeframe for reporting planned operational 
changes to 24 months. Since some credit unions are eligible for an 
extended exam cycle of up to 20 months, the NCUA believes the extension 
to 24 months will enable exam staff to monitor operations without an 
onsite presence.
    Besides this comment and the concerns with reporting vendor and 
product information, which are discussed in the Other Comments Received 
section, the NCUA did not receive any comments and will proceed with 
these changes.

Information Technology Tab

    The NCUA proposed adding, removing, or relocating items as noted in 
the July 26, 2024, Federal Register Notice. The NCUA identified Remote 
Deposit Capture was being reported in Item 5 on the Information 
Technology tab and on the Payment Systems Service Providers tab. The 
item and related instructions were removed from the Information 
Technology tab.
    One commenter objected to the NCUA extending the timeframe for 
reporting planned operational changes to 24 months. Since some credit 
unions are eligible for an extended exam cycle of up to 20 months, the 
NCUA believes the extension to 24 months will enable exam staff to 
monitor operations without an onsite presence.
    Besides this comment and the concerns with reporting vendor and 
product information, which are discussed in the Other Comments Received 
section, the NCUA did not receive any comments and will proceed with 
these changes.

Grants Tab

    The NCUA proposed removing the Grants tab. No comments related to 
these changes were received, so the NCUA will proceed with these 
changes.

Merger Partner Registry Tab

    The NCUA proposed adding an item for MDIs to express interest in 
being considered an MDI merger partner. One commenter asked why the 
NCUA needs this information and how it will be used.
    The NCUA strives to preserve MDI credit unions and will use this 
information to identify merger partners for MDIs. The NCUA can preserve 
the MDI status by merging MDIs. As a group, MDI credit unions work to 
offer safe, fair, and affordable financial services to individuals and 
communities that may otherwise lack access to them. In doing so, MDI 
credit unions help their members build greater financial security and 
help address historical inequities in the financial system. After 
considering this comment, the NCUA will proceed with these changes.

Other Comments Received

    The NCUA also received comments related to the added burden on 
credit unions, adherence to the Administrative Procedure Act, and the 
confidentiality and security of vendor, product, or system information.

Burden

    Two commenters were concerned with the increase in burden. While we 
understand these concerns, we do not expect these revisions will result 
in a material increase in reporting burden. The information needed to 
complete the new questions is readily available and, as with all 
information on the Profile, the information must be reported only once 
and will then be pre-populated every quarter. Unless the information 
changes, the credit union will not need to report it every quarter. 
Also, these new items will improve our off-site monitoring, which will 
reduce the burden of on-site examinations.

Administrative Procedure Act

    The NCUA agrees on the importance of following the Administrative 
Procedure Act when it applies and in providing opportunities for input 
and transparency even when it does not. The NCUA does not believe any 
of the proposed changes require notice and comment under the 
Administrative Procedure Act, and the commenter did not specifically 
identify any items that it believes would have required this process. 
Nonetheless, the NCUA has increased the transparency of the Call Report 
and Profile update processes by publishing notifications to the NCUA 
website and sending emails to the public to advise of open comment 
periods and encourage public input.

Confidentiality and Security

    Three commenters expressed a concern with the collection of vendor, 
product, or system information. These commenters noted this information 
would be publicly available. Information required to be submitted to 
the NCUA in response to a field marked as non-public will be treated as 
commercial confidential financial information if it meets the 
requirements in 12 CFR part 792.
    One of these commenters was concerned with the security measures--
such as encryption, access controls, and secure storage--the NCUA will 
employ to ensure this information is not disclosed to unauthorized 
parties. To protect all sensitive data collected from credit unions, 
the NCUA employs industry standards such as 256-bit encryption, 
stringent access control protocols, multi-factor authentication, and 
secure isolated storage solutions compliant with National Institute of 
Standards and Technology guidelines.
    Collecting vendor, product, and system information on the Profile 
helps the NCUA properly scope examination and supervision contacts, 
proactively identify credit unions impacted by events (for example, 
cyber incidents) and perform data analysis across the industry. Cyber 
criminals, foreign adversaries, and money launderers continue to 
exploit vulnerabilities identified across U.S. critical infrastructure 
sectors.
    Affected Public: Private Sector: Not-for-profit institutions.
    Estimated Number of Respondents: 4,572.
    Estimated Number of Responses per Respondent: 4.
    Estimated Total Annual Responses: 18,848.
    Estimated Hours per Response: 2.
    Estimated Total Annual Burden Hours: 36,576.
    Reason for Change: Burden decreased due to a decrease in the number 
of respondents.
    Request for Comments: Comments submitted in response to this notice 
will be summarized and included in the request for Office of Management 
and Budget approval. All comments will become a matter of public 
record. The public is invited to submit comments concerning: (a) 
whether the collection of information is necessary for the proper 
performance of the function of the agency, including whether the 
information will have practical utility; (b) the accuracy of the 
agency's estimate of the burden of the collection of

[[Page 83911]]

information, including the validity of the methodology and assumptions 
used; (c) ways to enhance the quality, utility, and clarity of the 
information to be collected; and (d) ways to minimize the burden of the 
collection of the information on the respondents, including the use of 
automated collection techniques or other forms of information 
technology.
