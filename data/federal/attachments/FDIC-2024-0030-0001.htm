    General Description of Collection: Section 19 of the Federal 
Deposit Insurance Act (FDI), 12 U.S.C. 1829, requires the FDIC's 
consent prior to any participation in the affairs of an insured 
depository institution by an individual who has been convicted of 
crimes involving dishonesty or breach of trust, and included drug-
related convictions. To obtain that consent, certain individuals and 
insured depository institutions must submit an application to the FDIC 
for approval on Form FDIC 6710/07.
    Request for Comment: Comments are invited on: (a) Whether the 
collections of information are necessary for the proper performance of 
the FDIC's functions, including whether the information has practical 
utility; (b) the accuracy of the estimates of the burden of the 
information collections, including the validity of the methodology and 
assumptions used; (c) ways to enhance the quality, utility, and clarity 
of the information to be collected; and (d) ways to minimize the burden 
of the collections of information on respondents, including through the 
use of automated collection techniques or other forms of information 
technology. All comments will become a matter of public record.

Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation.

    Dated at Washington, DC, on April 12, 2024.
James P. Sheesley,
Assistant Executive Secretary.
