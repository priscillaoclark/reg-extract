SECURITIES AND EXCHANGE COMMISSION

[SEC File No. 270-347, OMB Control No. 3235-0393]


Submission for OMB Review; Comment Request; Extension: Rule 15g-4

Upon Written Request, Copies Available From: Securities and Exchange 
Commission, Office of FOIA Services, 100 F Street NE, Washington, DC 
20549-2736

    Notice is hereby given that pursuant to the Paperwork Reduction Act 
of 1995 (``PRA'') (44 U.S.C. 3501 et seq.), the Securities and Exchange 
Commission (``Commission'') has submitted to the Office of Management 
and Budget (``OMB'') a request for extension of the existing collection 
of information provided for in Rule 15g-4--Disclosure of compensation 
to brokers or dealers (17 CRF 240.15g-4) under the Securities Exchange 
Act of 1934 (15 U.S.C. 78a et seq.).
    Rule 15g-4 requires brokers and dealers effecting transactions in 
penny stocks for or with customers to disclose the amount of 
compensation received by the broker-dealer in connection with the 
transaction. The purpose of the rule is to increase the level of 
disclosure to investors concerning penny stocks generally and specific 
penny stock transactions.
    The Commission estimates that approximately 170 broker-dealers will 
each spend an average of approximately 87.0833333 hours annually to 
comply with this rule. Thus, the total time burden is approximately 
14,804 hours per year.
    Rule 15g-4 contains record retention requirements. Compliance with 
the rule is mandatory. The required records are available only to the 
examination staff of the Commission and the self regulatory 
organizations of which the broker-dealer is a member.
    An agency may not conduct or sponsor, and a person is not required 
to respond to, a collection of information under the PRA unless it 
displays a currently valid OMB control number.
    The public may view background documentation for this information 
collection at the following website: <a href="http://www.reginfo.gov">www.reginfo.gov</a>. Find this 
particular information collection by selecting ``Currently under 30-day 
Review--Open for Public Comments'' or by using the search function. 
Written comments and recommendations for the proposed information 
collection should be sent by September 9, 2024 to (i) <a href="http://www.reginfo.gov/public/do/PRAMain">www.reginfo.gov/public/do/PRAMain</a>
