I. Self-Regulatory Organization's Statement of the Terms of Substance 
of the Proposed Rule Change

    The Exchange proposes to amend NYSE Arca Equities Rule 7.37, Order 
Execution, to clarify Users' ability to instruct NYSE Arca to bypass 
non-Regulation NMS protected market centers when routing away. The text 
of the proposed rule change is available at the Exchange, the 
Commission's Public Reference Room, at the Commission's Web site at 
<A HREF="http://frwebgate.access.gpo.gov/cgi-bin/leaving.cgi?from=leavingFR.html&log=linklog&to=http://www.sec.gov">http://www.sec.gov</A>, and <A HREF="http://frwebgate.access.gpo.gov/cgi-bin/leaving.cgi?from=leavingFR.html&log=linklog&to=http://www.nyse.com">http://www.nyse.com</A>.

II. Self-Regulatory Organization's Statement of the Purpose of, and 
Statutory Basis for, the Proposed Rule Change

    In its filing with the Commission, the self-regulatory organization 
included statements concerning the purpose of, and basis for, the 
proposed rule change and discussed any comments it received on the 
proposed rule change. The text of those statements may be examined at 
the places specified in Item IV below. The Exchange has prepared 
summaries, set forth in sections A, B, and C below, of the most 
significant parts of such statements.

A. Self-Regulatory Organization's Statement of the Purpose of, and 
Statutory Basis for, the Proposed Rule Change

1. Purpose
    The Exchange proposes to amend NYSE Arca Equities Rule 7.37, Order 
Execution, to clarify Users' ability to instruct NYSE Arca when routing 
eligible unexecuted orders to bypass any market centers that are not 
posting Protected Quotations within the meaning of Regulation NMS.
    In March 2008, NYSE Arca Equities began offering clients access to 
undisplayed liquidity via Indications of Interest by adding several new 
routing venues (``IOI Routing Functionality''). In May 2008, NYSE Arca 
Equities provided Users the ability to opt out of this IOI Routing 
Functionality. Users are currently able to opt out of IOI Routing 
Functionality while retaining the ability to use the full array of 
routable orders by marking any routable order as not eligible to route 
to market centers that are not posting Protected Quotations.
    In order to increase awareness of this option, the Exchange now 
proposes to add the following text to proposed Rule 7.37(d)(4):
    For an order that has not been executed in its entirety pursuant to 
paragraphs (a) through (c) of this Rule, and which is otherwise 
eligible to route away, Users may instruct NYSE Arca to bypass any 
market centers that are not posting Protected Quotations within the 
meaning of Regulation NMS.
    The Exchange also notes that the proposed rule is substantially 
similar to Nasdaq Rule 4758 (1)(A)(iv).
2. Statutory Basis
    The proposed rule change is consistent with Section 6(b) \3\ of the 
Act, in general, and furthers the objectives of Section 6(b)(5) \4\ in 
particular in that it is designed to prevent fraudulent and 
manipulative acts and practices, to promote just and equitable 
principles of trade, to foster cooperation and coordination with 
persons engaged in facilitating transactions in securities, and to 
remove impediments to and perfect the mechanism of a free and open 
market and a national market system. The Exchange believes that the 
proposed amendment is consistent with the goal of removing impediments 
to a free and open market because the changes proposed herein will 
clarify currently existing routing options designed to give Users 
flexibility and control over how their orders route to away market 
centers.

    \4\ 15 U.S.C. 78f(b)(5).
---------------------------------------------------------------------------

B. Self-Regulatory Organization's Statement on Burden on Competition

    The Exchange does not believe that the proposed rule change will 
impose any burden on competition that is not necessary or appropriate 
in furtherance of the purposes of the Act.

C. Self-Regulatory Organization's Statement on Comments on the Proposed 
Rule Change Received From Members, Participants or Others

    No written comments were solicited or received with respect to the 
proposed rule change.

III. Date of Effectiveness of the Proposed Rule Change and Timing for 
Commission Action

    Because the foregoing proposed rule change does not: (i) 
Significantly affect the protection of investors or the public 
interest; (ii) impose any significant burden on competition; and (iii) 
become operative for 30 days from the date on which it was filed, or 
such shorter time as the Commission may designate, it has become 
effective pursuant to Section 19(b)(3)(A) of the Act \5\ and Rule 19b-
4(f)(6)(iii) thereunder.\6\
---------------------------------------------------------------------------

    \5\ 15 U.S.C. 78s(b)(3)(A).
    \6\ 17 CFR 240.19b-4(f)(6). In addition, Rule 19b-4(f)(6)(iii) 
requires that a self-regulatory organization submit to the 
Commission written notice of its intent to file the proposed rule 
change, along with a brief description and text of the proposed rule 
change, at least five business days prior to the date of filing of 
the proposed rule change, or such shorter time as designated by the 
Commission. The Exchange has satisfied this requirement.
---------------------------------------------------------------------------

    At any time within 60 days of the filing of the proposed rule 
change, the Commission summarily may temporarily suspend such rule 
change if it appears to the Commission that such action is necessary or 
appropriate in the public interest, for the protection of

[[Page 65042]]

investors, or otherwise in furtherance of the purposes of the Act.
