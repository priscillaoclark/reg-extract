SECURITIES AND EXCHANGE COMMISSION

[SEC File No. 270-136, OMB Control No. 3235-0157]


Submission for OMB Review; Comment Request; Extension: Form N-8F

Upon Written Request, Copies Available From: Securities and Exchange 
Commission, Office of FOIA Services, 100 F Street NE, Washington, DC 
20549-2736.

    Notice is hereby given that, pursuant to the Paperwork Reduction 
Act of 1995 (44 U.S.C. 3501 et seq.), the Securities and Exchange 
Commission (the ``Commission'') has submitted to the Office of 
Management and Budget a request for extension of the previously 
approved collection of information discussed below.
    Form N-8F (17 CFR 274.218) is the form prescribed for use by 
registered investment companies in certain circumstances to request 
orders of the Commission declaring that the registration of that 
investment company cease to be in effect. The form requests information 
about: (i) the investment company's identity, (ii) the investment 
company's distributions, (iii) the investment company's assets and 
liabilities, (iv) the events leading to the request to deregister, and 
(v) the conclusion of the investment company's business. The 
information is needed by the Commission to determine whether an order 
of deregistration is appropriate.
    The Form takes approximately 5.2 hours on average to complete. It 
is estimated that approximately 101 investment companies file Form N-8F 
annually, so the total annual burden for the form is estimated to be 
approximately 525 hours. The estimate of average burden hours is made 
solely for the purposes of the Paperwork Reduction Act and is not 
derived from a comprehensive or even a representative survey or study. 
Commission staff continues to believe that there is no cost burden for 
completing and filing Form N-8F.
    The collection of information on Form N-8F is not mandatory. The 
information provided on Form N-8F is not kept confidential. An agency 
may not conduct or sponsor, and a person is not required to respond to, 
a collection of information unless it displays a currently-valid OMB 
control number.
    The 30-day public comment period for this information collection 
request opens on December 4, 2024 and closes on January 3, 2025. The 
public may view the full information request and submit comments at 
<a href="https://www.reginfo.gov/public/do/PRAViewICR?ref_nbr=202408-3235-028">https://www.reginfo.gov/public/do/PRAViewICR?ref_nbr=202408-3235-028</a> or

    Dated: November 26, 2024.
Sherry R. Haywood,
Assistant Secretary.
