SECURITIES AND EXCHANGE COMMISSION

[SEC File No. 270-136, OMB Control No. 3235-0157]


Proposed Collection; Comment Request; Extension: Form N-8F

Upon Written Request, Copies Available From: Securities and Exchange 
Commission, Office of FOIA Services, 100 F Street NE, Washington, DC 
20549-2736

    Notice is hereby given that, pursuant to the Paperwork Reduction 
Act of 1995 (44 U.S.C. 3501 et seq.), the Securities and Exchange 
Commission (the ``Commission'') is soliciting comments on the 
collection of information summarized below. The Commission plans to 
submit this existing collection of information to the Office of 
Management and Budget for extension and approval.
    Form N-8F (17 CFR 274.218) is the form prescribed for use by 
registered investment companies in certain circumstances to request 
orders of the Commission declaring that the registration of that 
investment company cease to be in effect. The form requests information 
about: (i) the investment company's identity, (ii) the investment 
company's distributions, (iii) the investment company's assets and 
liabilities, (iv) the events leading to the request to deregister, and 
(v) the conclusion of the investment company's business. The 
information is needed by the Commission to determine whether an order 
of deregistration is appropriate.
    The Form takes approximately 5.2 hours on average to complete. It 
is estimated that approximately 101 investment companies file Form N-8F 
annually, so the total annual burden for the form is estimated to be 
approximately 525 hours. The estimate of average burden hours is made 
solely for the purposes of the Paperwork Reduction Act and is not 
derived from a comprehensive or even a representative survey or study. 
Commission staff continues to believe that there is no cost burden for 
completing and filing Form N-8F.
    The collection of information on Form N-8F is not mandatory. The 
information provided on Form N-8F is not kept confidential. An agency 
may not conduct or sponsor, and a person is not required to respond to, 
a collection of information unless it displays a currently-valid OMB 
control number.
    Written comments are invited on: (a) whether the proposed 
collection of information is necessary for the proper performance of 
the functions of the Commission, including whether the information 
shall have practical utility; (b) the accuracy of the Commission's 
estimate of the burden of the collection of information; (c) ways to 
enhance the quality, utility, and clarity of the information collected; 
and (d) ways to minimize the burden of the collection of information on 
respondents, including through the use of automated collection 
techniques or other forms of information technology. Consideration will 
be given to comments and suggestions submitted by November 8, 2024.
    An agency may not conduct or sponsor, and a person is not required 
to respond to, a collection of information under the PRA unless it 
displays a currently valid OMB control number.
    Please direct your written comments to: Austin Gerig, Director/
Chief Data Officer, Securities and Exchange Commission, c/o Oluwaseun 
Ajayi, 100 F Street NE, Washington, DC 20549 or send an email to:

    Dated: September 3, 2024.
Vanessa A. Countryman,
Secretary.
