SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION: 
    Title: Reporting, Recordkeeping, and Daily Trading Records 
Requirements for Swap Dealers and Major Swap Participants (OMB Control 
Nos. 3038-0087). This is a request for an extension of a currently 
approved information collection.
    Abstract: On April 3, 2012, the Commission adopted Commission 
regulations 23.201 through 23.205 (Reporting, Recordkeeping, and Daily 
Trading Records Requirements For Swap Dealers and Major Swap 
Participants) \2\ pursuant to sections 4s(f) \3\ and 4s(g) \4\ of the 
Commodity Exchange Act (``CEA'').\5\ Commission regulations 23.201 
through 23.205 require, among other things, swap dealers (``SD'') \6\ 
and major swap participants (``MSP'') \7\ to maintain transaction and 
position records of their swaps (including daily trading records) and 
to maintain specified business records (including records related to 
the governance and financial status of the swap dealer or major swap 
participant, complaints received by such SD or MSP and such SD or MSP's 
marketing and sales materials). They also require SDs and MSPs to 
report certain swap transaction data to swap data repositories, to 
satisfy certain real time public reporting requirements, and to 
maintain records of information reported to swap data depositories and 
for real time reporting purposes.\8\ The Commission believes that the 
information collection obligations imposed by Commission regulations 
23.201 through 23.205 are necessary to implement sections 4s(f) and 
4s(g) of the CEA, including ensuring that each SD and MSP maintains the 
required records of their business activities and an audit trail 
sufficient to conduct comprehensive and accurate trade reconstruction.

    An agency may not conduct or sponsor, and a person is not required 
to respond to, a collection of information unless it displays a 
currently valid OMB control number. On April 26, 2022, the Commission 
published in the Federal Register notice of the proposed extension of 
this information collection and provided 60 days for public comment on 
the proposed extension, 87 FR 24533 (``60-Day Notice''). The Commission 
did not receive any relevant comments on the 60-Day Notice.

    Estimated Average Burden Hours per Respondent: 2,096.
    Estimated Total Annual Burden Hours: 224,272.
    Frequency of Collection: As applicable.
    There are no capital costs or operating and maintenance costs 
associated with this collection.
