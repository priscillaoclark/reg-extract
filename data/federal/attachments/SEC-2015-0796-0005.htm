SECURITIES AND EXCHANGE COMMISSION

[SEC File No. 270-560, OMB Control No. 3235-0622]


Submission for OMB Review; Comment Request; Extension: 
Interagency Statement on Sound Practices

Upon Written Request, Copies Available From: Securities and Exchange 
Commission, Office of FOIA Services, 100 F Street NE, Washington, DC 
20549-2736.

    Notice is hereby given that pursuant to the Paperwork Reduction Act 
of 1995 (``PRA'') (44 U.S.C. 3501 et seq.) the Securities and Exchange 
Commission (``Commission'') has submitted to the Office of Management 
and Budget (``OMB'') a request for approval of extension of the 
previously approved collection of information provided for in the 
Interagency Statement on Sound Practices Concerning Elevated Risk 
Complex Structured Finance Activities (``Statement'') under the 
Securities Exchange Act of 1934 (15 U.S.C. 78a et seq.) and the 
Investment Advisers Act of 1940 (15 U.S.C. 80b et seq.).
    The Statement was issued by the Commission, together with the 
Office of the Comptroller of the Currency, the Board of Governors of 
the Federal Reserve System, the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation, 
and the Office of Thrift Supervision (together, the ``Agencies''), in 
May 2006. The Statement describes the types of internal controls and 
risk management procedures that the Agencies believe are particularly 
effective in assisting financial institutions to identify and address 
the reputational, legal, and other risks associated with elevated risk 
complex structured finance transactions.
    The primary purpose of the Statement is to ensure that these 
transactions receive enhanced scrutiny by the

institution and to ensure that the institution does not participate in 
illegal or inappropriate transactions.
    The Commission estimates that approximately 5 registered broker-
dealers or investment advisers will spend an average of approximately 
25 hours per year complying with the Statement. Thus, the total time 
burden is estimated to be approximately 125 hours per year.
    An agency may not conduct or sponsor, and a person is not required 
to respond to, a collection of information under the PRA unless it 
displays a currently valid OMB control number.

collection at the following website: <a href="http://www.reginfo.gov">www.reginfo.gov</a>. Find this
