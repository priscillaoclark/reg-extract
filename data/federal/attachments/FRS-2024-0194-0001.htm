Final Approval Under OMB Delegated Authority of the Extension for Three 
Years, Without Revision, of the Following Information Collection

    Collection title: Recordkeeping Requirements Associated with 
Regulation GG.
    Collection identifier: FR GG.

[[Page 61119]]

    OMB control number: 7100-0317.
    General description of collection: Regulation GG--Prohibition on 
Funding of Unlawful internet Gambling (12 CFR part 233) is related to 
the Unlawful internet Gambling Enforcement Act of 2006. The FR GG is 
the Board's information collection associated with Regulation GG and 
requires participants in designated payment systems to establish 
written policies and procedures related to unlawful internet gambling. 
These recordkeeping requirements are contained in section 5 of 
Regulation GG. Policies and procedures reasonably designed to identify 
and block, or otherwise prevent or prohibit, restricted transactions 
are necessary because Congress found that internet gambling is 
primarily funded through personal use of payment system instruments, 
credit cards, and wire transfers.
    Frequency: Event-generated.
    Respondents: Depository institutions, card system operators, credit 
unions, and money transmitting business operators.
    Total estimated number of respondents: 4,635.
    Total estimated annual burden hours: 46,410.
    Current actions: On March 7, 2024, the Board published a notice in 
the Federal Register (89 FR 16572) requesting public comment for 60 
days on the extension, without revision, of the FR GG. The comment 
period for this notice expired on May 6, 2024. The Board did not 
receive any comments.

    Board of Governors of the Federal Reserve System, July 24, 2024.
Michele Taylor Fennell,
Deputy Associate Secretary of the Board.
