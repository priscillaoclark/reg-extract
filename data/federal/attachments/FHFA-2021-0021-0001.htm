Privacy Act of 1974; System of Records

AGENCY: Federal Housing Finance Agency.

ACTION: Notice of a new system of records.

-----------------------------------------------------------------------

SUMMARY: In accordance with the requirements of the Privacy Act of 
1974, as amended, (Privacy Act), the Federal Housing Finance Agency 
(FHFA or Agency) is establishing FHFA-26, Public Health Emergency 
Records System, a system of records under the Privacy Act. This system 
of records maintains information collected in response to a public 
health emergency, such as a pandemic or epidemic, from FHFA staff 
(including political appointees, employees, former employees, 
detailees, applicants for employment, and interns), contractors, and 
visitors to FHFA facilities or FHFA-sponsored events, that is necessary 
to ensure a safe and healthy work environment. FHFA may collect these 
records in response to a health-related declaration of a national 
emergency by the President, a public health emergency declared by the 
Health and Human Service (HHS) Secretary or designated federal 
official, or a public health emergency declared by a state or local 
authority. Even in the absence of a declaration of a health-related 
national emergency or public health emergency, FHFA may collect these 
records if it determines that a significant risk of substantial harm 
exists to the health of FHFA staff (as defined above), contractors, and 
visitors to FHFA facilities or FHFA-sponsored events.

DATES: In accordance with 5 U.S.C. 552a(e)(4) and (11), this system of 
records will go into effect without further notice on November 18, 
2021, unless otherwise revised pursuant to comments received. New 
routine uses will go into effect on December 20, 2021. Comments must be 
received on or before December 20, 2021. FHFA will publish a new notice 
if the effective date is delayed in order for the Agency to review the 
comments or if changes are made based on comments received.

SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION:

I. Comments

    FHFA seeks public comments on a new system of records and will take 
all comments into consideration. See 5 U.S.C. 552a(e)(4) and (11). In 
addition to referencing ``Comments/No. 2021-N-12,'' please reference 
FHFA-26, Public Health Emergency Records System. All comments received 
will be posted without change on the FHFA website at <a href="https://www.fhfa.gov">https://www.fhfa.gov</a> and will include any personal information provided, such 
as name, address (mailing and email), telephone numbers.

II. Introduction

    This notice informs the public of FHFA's proposal to establish a 
new FHFA system of records. This notice satisfies the Privacy Act's 
requirement that an agency publish a system of records notice in the 
Federal Register when establishing a new or making a significant change 
to an agency's system of records. Congress has recognized that 
application of all requirements of the Privacy Act to certain 
categories of records may have an undesirable and often unacceptable 
effect upon agencies in the conduct of necessary public business. 
Consequently, Congress established general exemptions and specific 
exemptions that could be used to exempt records from provisions of the 
Privacy Act. Congress also required that exempting records from 
provisions of the Privacy Act would require the head of an agency to 
publish a determination to exempt a record from the Privacy Act as a 
rule in accordance with the Administrative Procedure Act. The General 
Counsel has determined that records and information in this system of 
records are not exempt from the requirements of the Privacy Act.
    As required by the Privacy Act, 5 U.S.C. 552a(r), and pursuant to 
section 7 of OMB Circular No. A-108, Federal Agency Responsibilities 
for Review, Reporting, and Publication under the Privacy Act, (81 FR 
94424 (Dec. 23, 2016)), prior to publication of this notice, FHFA 
submitted a report describing the system of records covered by this 
notice to the Office of Management and Budget, the Committee on 
Oversight and Government Reform of the House of Representatives and the 
Committee on Homeland Security and Governmental Affairs of the Senate.

III. New System of Records

    The purpose of the new ``Public Health Emergency Records System'' 
(FHFA-26) is to assist FHFA with maintaining a safe and healthy 
workplace and responding to a public health emergency. These measures 
may include instituting activities such as: Requiring FHFA staff (as 
defined above), contractors, and visitors to FHFA facilities or FHFA-
sponsored events to provide information related to medical/health 
screening, contact tracing, and vaccination status before being allowed 
access to an FHFA facility or FHFA-sponsored event, a regulated 
entity's facility, or the facility of a third-party for official 
business purposes.
    FHFA may collect these records in response to a health-related 
declaration of a national emergency by the President, a public health 
emergency declared by the HHS Secretary or a designated federal 
official, or a public health emergency declared by a state or local 
authority. In the absence of a declaration of a health-related national 
emergency or public health emergency, FHFA may collect these records if 
it determines that a significant risk of substantial harm exists to the 
health of FHFA staff (as defined above), contractors, and visitors to 
FHFA facilities or FHFA-sponsored events. FHFA will collect and 
maintain the records in accordance with the Americans with Disabilities 
Act of 1990 and guidance published by the U.S. Occupational Safety and 
Health Administration, the U.S. Equal Employment Opportunity 
Commission, and the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention.
    The new system of records is described in detail below.

    Public Health Emergency Records System, FHFA-26.

SECURITY CLASSIFICATION:

SYSTEM LOCATION:
    Federal Housing Finance Agency, 400 Seventh Street SW, Washington, 
DC 20219, and any alternate work site used by employees of FHFA, 
including contractors assisting agency employees, FHFA-authorized cloud 
service providers, and FHFA-authorized contractor networks located 
within the Continental United States.

SYSTEM MANAGER(S):
    Office of Facilities and Operations Management, Security & 
Transportation Operations Branch, Supervisory Security Specialist, 
(202) 649-3940, Federal Housing Finance Agency, 400 Seventh Street SW, 
Washington, DC 20219.

AUTHORITY FOR MAINTENANCE OF THE SYSTEM:
    Workforce safety federal requirements, including the Occupational 
Safety and Health Act of 1970 (29 U.S.C. 654); Occupational safety and 
health programs for Federal employees; 5 U.S.C. 7902; the 
Rehabilitation Act of 1973 (29 U.S.C. 791 et seq.); Title VII of the 
Civil Rights Act (42 U.S.C. 2000e(j)); 29 CFR 1605; the Americans with 
Disabilities Act (42 U.S.C. 12112(d)(3)(B)); Executive Order Nos. 
12196, 12148, 12656, 13991, 13994, 14042 and 14043; the federal laws 
that authorize FHFA to create and maintain federal records of agency 
activities, 5 U.S.C. 301, 44 U.S.C. 3101; and the Federal Housing 
Enterprises Financial Safety and Soundness Act of 1992, as amended (12 
U.S.C. 4501 et seq.).

PURPOSE(S) OF THE SYSTEM:
    The Public Health Emergency Records System (FHFA-26) is being 
established by FHFA to assist the agency with maintaining a safe and 
healthy workplace and responding to a public health emergency. These 
measures may include instituting activities such as: Requiring FHFA 
staff, contractors, and visitors to FHFA facilities or FHFA-sponsored 
events to provide information related to medical/health screening, 
contact tracing, and vaccination status before being allowed access to 
an FHFA facility or FHFA-sponsored event, a regulated entity's 
facility, or the facility of a third-party for official business 
purposes, in response to a health-related declaration of a national 
emergency by the President, a public health emergency declared by the 
HHS Secretary or designated federal official, or a public health 
emergency declared by a state or local authority. In the

[[Page 64470]]

absence of a declaration of a health-related national emergency or 
public health emergency, FHFA may collect these records if it 
determines that a significant risk of substantial harm exists to the 
health of FHFA staff, contractors, and visitors to FHFA facilities, 
FHFA-sponsored events, a regulated entity's facility, or a third-
party's facility. The system serves four main purposes: 1. Assist with 
medical/health screening for individuals requesting entry into FHFA 
facilities or FHFA-sponsored events; 2. Perform contact tracing to 
notify individuals who may have had exposure to someone who is known or 
is believed to be infected with a contagious or communicable disease 
that is the subject of a public health emergency; 3. Establish a record 
collection to ensure FHFA collects medical information if it determines 
that a significant risk of substantial harm exists to the health of 
FHFA Staff, in addition to collecting medical information pursuant to 
the implementing guidance of applicable federal laws, public health 
mandates, and executive orders; and 4. Evaluate, approve, deny, and 
implement requests for medical and religious exceptions.

CATEGORIES OF INDIVIDUALS COVERED BY THE SYSTEM:
