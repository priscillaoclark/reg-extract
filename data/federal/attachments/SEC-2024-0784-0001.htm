Authority, Inc.; Notice of Designation of a Longer Period for 
Commission Action on a Proposed Rule Change To Adopt the FINRA Rule 
6500 Series (Securities Lending and Transparency Engine (SLATE\TM\))

June 10, 2024.
    On May 1, 2024, the Financial Industry Regulatory Authority, Inc. 
(``FINRA'') filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission 
(``Commission''), pursuant to section 19(b)(1) of the Securities 
Exchange Act of 1934 (``Act'') \1\ and Rule 19b-4 thereunder,\2\ a 
proposed rule change to adopt the new FINRA Rule 6500 Series 
(Securities Lending and Transparency Engine (SLATE<SUP>TM</SUP>)) to 
(1) require reporting of securities loans; and (2) provide for the 
public dissemination of loan information. The proposed rule change was 
published for comment in the Federal Register on May 7, 2024.\3\
---------------------------------------------------------------------------

    \1\ 15 U.S.C. 78s(b)(1).
    \2\ 17 CFR 240.19b-4.
    \3\ See Securities Exchange Act Release No. 100046 (May 1, 
2024), 89 FR 38203. Comments received on the proposed rule change 
are available at: <a href="https://www.sec.gov/comments/sr-finra-2024-007/srfinra2024007.htm">https://www.sec.gov/comments/sr-finra-2024-007/srfinra2024007.htm</a>.
---------------------------------------------------------------------------

    Section 19(b)(2) of the Act \4\ provides that, within 45 days of 
the publication of notice of the filing of a proposed rule change, or 
within such longer period up to 90 days as the Commission may designate 
if it finds such longer period to be appropriate and publishes its 
reasons for so finding or as to which the self-regulatory organization 
consents, the Commission shall either approve the proposed rule change, 
disapprove the proposed rule change, or institute proceedings to 
determine whether the proposed rule change should be disapproved. The 
45th day after publication of the notice for this proposed rule change 
is June 21, 2024. The Commission is extending this 45-day time period.
---------------------------------------------------------------------------

    \4\ 15 U.S.C. 78s(b)(2).
---------------------------------------------------------------------------

    The Commission finds that it is appropriate to designate a longer 
period within which to take action on the proposed rule change so that 
it has sufficient time to consider the proposed rule change and the 
comments received. Accordingly, pursuant to section 19(b)(2) of the 
Act, the Commission designates August 5, 2024, as the date by which the 
Commission shall either approve or disapprove, or institute proceedings 
to determine whether to disapprove, the proposed rule change (File No. 
SR-FINRA-2024-007).

    For the Commission, by the Division of Trading and Markets, 
pursuant to delegated authority.\5\
