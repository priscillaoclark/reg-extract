all comments received from the public and other agencies.
    During the comment period for this proposal, a copy of the proposed 
PRA OMB submission, including the draft reporting form and 
instructions, supporting statement (which contains more detail about 
the information collection and burden estimates than this notice), and 
other documentation, will be made available on the Board's public

Request for Comment on Information Collection Proposal

    The Board invites public comment on the following information 
collection, which is being reviewed under authority delegated by the 
OMB under the PRA. Comments are invited on the following:
    a. Whether the proposed collection of information is necessary for 
the proper performance of the Board's functions, including whether the 
information has practical utility;
    b. The accuracy of the Board's estimate of the burden of the 
proposed information collection, including the validity of the 
methodology and assumptions used;
    c. Ways to enhance the quality, utility, and clarity of the

    At the end of the comment period, the comments and recommendations

Proposal Under OMB Delegated Authority To Extend for Three Years, With 
Revision, the Following Information Collection

    Collection title: Financial Statements of Foreign Subsidiaries of 
U.S. Banking Organizations, and Financial Statements of U.S. Nonbank 
Subsidiaries of U.S. Holding Companies.
    Collection identifier: FR 2314, FR 2314S, Y-11, Y-11S; OMB No. 
7100-0073.
    OMB control number: 7100-0073.\1\
---------------------------------------------------------------------------

    \1\ As part of this clearance, the Board will clear the FR 2314, 
FR 2314S, Y-11, and FR Y-11S under the FR 2314 OMB control number 
(7100-0073), and then discontinue the FR Y-11's separate OMB control 
number (7100-0244). This non-substantive change is aimed at 
simplifying the tracking and clearance process for the four related 
forms. This change would not modify the reporting or recordkeeping 
requirements of the forms described in this Supporting Statement in 
any way. The collection will then be titled Financial Statements of 
U.S. Nonbank Subsidiaries of U.S. Holding Companies and Financial 
Statements of Foreign Subsidiaries of U.S. Banking Organizations (FR 
2314, FR 2314S, FR Y-11, and FR Y-11S; OMB No. 7100-0073).
---------------------------------------------------------------------------

    General description of collection: The FR 2314 reporting forms 
collect financial information for non-functionally regulated direct or 
indirect foreign subsidiaries of U.S. state member banks, Edge and 
agreement corporations, and holding companies (i.e., bank holding 
companies, savings and loan holding companies, securities holding 
companies, and intermediate holding companies). The data from the FR 
2314 forms are used to identify current and potential problems at the 
foreign subsidiaries of U.S. parent companies, to monitor the 
activities of U.S. banking organizations in specific countries, and to 
develop a better understanding of activities within the industry, in 
general, and of individual institutions, in particular.
    The FR Y-11 reporting forms collect financial information for 
individual non-functionally regulated U.S. nonbank subsidiaries of 
domestic holding companies (HCs), which is essential for monitoring the 
subsidiaries' potential impact on the condition of the HC or its 
subsidiary banks. HCs file the FR Y-11 on a quarterly or annual basis, 
or the FR Y-11S on an annual basis, predominantly based on whether the 
organization meets certain asset size thresholds. The data from the FR 
Y-11 forms are used with other holding company data to assess the 
condition of HCs that are heavily engaged in nonbanking activities and 
to monitor the volume, nature, and condition of their nonbanking 
operations.
    Proposed revisions: The Board proposes to revise the FR 2314 and FR 
Y-11 forms and instructions to be consistent with adopted changes to 
U.S. generally accepted accounting principles related to troubled debt 
restructurings, provisions for credit losses on off-balance sheet 
credit exposures, and expected recoveries of amounts previously charged 
off included within the allowances for credit losses. The Board also 
proposes to revise the FR 2314 and FR Y-11 instructions by modifying 
and clarifying the recordkeeping requirements related to the submitted 
form. Additionally, the Board proposes to incorporate six line items 
from the FR 2502q, Quarterly Report of Assets and Liabilities of Large 
Foreign Offices of U.S. Banks (OMB Control No. 7100-0079), into the FR 
2314. The revisions are proposed to take effect for the December 31, 
2024, as-of date.
    Lastly, following the completion of this clearance, the Board will 
remove the Financial Statements of U.S. Nonbank Subsidiaries Held by 
Foreign Banking Organizations (FR Y-7N) and Abbreviated Financial 
Statements of U.S. Nonbank Subsidiaries Held by Foreign Banking 
Organizations (Y-7NS) from OMB No. 7100-0125. These reports will be 
moved to the OMB No. for the Financial Statement of Foreign 
Subsidiaries of U.S. Banking Organizations, Financial Statement of U.S. 
Nonbank Subsidiaries of U.S. Holding Companies (FR 2314, FR 2314S, FR 
Y-11, FR Y-11S; OMB No. 7100-0073). There are no proposed revisions to 
the FR 2314S and FR Y-11S at this time.
