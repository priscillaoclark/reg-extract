SECURITIES AND EXCHANGE COMMISSION

[Release No. 34-100815]


Notice of Intention To Cancel Registration of Certain Municipal 
Advisors Pursuant to Section 15b(C)(3) of the Securities Exchange Act 
of 1934

August 23, 2024.
    Notice is given that the Securities and Exchange Commission (the 
``Commission'') intends to issue an order or orders, pursuant to 
Section 15B(c)(3) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 (the ``Act''), 
cancelling the municipal advisor registration of Development & Public 
Finance, LLC (CIK# 1613281) (hereinafter referred to as the 
``Registrant'').
    Section 15B(c)(3) of the Act provides, in pertinent part, that if 
the Commission finds that any municipal advisor registered under 
Section 15B is no longer in existence or has ceased to do business as a 
municipal advisor, the Commission, by order, shall cancel the 
registration of such municipal advisor.
    The Commission finds that the Registrant:

    (i) has not filed any municipal advisor form submissions with 
the Commission through the Commission's Electronic Data Gathering 
and Retrieval (``EDGAR'') system since May 24, 2021 (including but 
not limited to the annual amendments (form MA-A) required by 17 CFR 
240.15Ba1-5(a)(1)); and/or
    (ii) based on information available from the Municipal 
Securities Rulemaking Board (the ``MSRB''), (a) is not registered as 
a municipal advisor with the MSRB under MSRB Rule A-12(a) and/or (b) 
does not have an associated person who is qualified as a municipal 
advisor representative under MSRB Rule G-3(d) and for whom there is 
a Form MA-I required by 17 CFR 240.15Ba1-2(b) available on EDGAR, 
and/or (c) has not, since February 2022, filed with the MSRB any 
Form A-12 annual affirmation as required by MSRB Rule A-12(k); and/
or withdrew its registration from the MSRB without first withdrawing 
its registration from the Commission.

    Accordingly, the Commission finds that the Registrant is either no 
longer in existence or has ceased to do business as a municipal 
advisor.
    Notice is also given that any interested person may, by September 
23, 2024, at 5:30 p.m. Eastern Time, submit to the Commission in 
writing a request for a hearing on the cancellation of the registration 
of the Registrant, accompanied by a statement as to the nature of such 
person's interest, the reason for such request, and the issues, if any, 
of fact or law proposed to be controverted, and such person may request 
to be notified if the Commission should order a hearing thereon. Any 
such communication should be addressed to the Commission's Secretary at 
the address below. All comments or requests received will be posted 
without change; the Commission does not edit personal identifying 
information from submissions. You should submit only information that 
you wish to make available publicly.
    At any time after September 23, 2024, the Commission may issue an 
order or orders cancelling the registration of the Registrant, upon the 
basis of the information stated above, unless an order or orders for a 
hearing on the cancellation shall be issued upon request or upon the 
Commission's own motion. Persons who requested a hearing, or to be 
advised as to whether a hearing is ordered, will receive any notices 
and orders issued in this matter, including the date of the hearing (if 
ordered) and any postponements thereof. Any Registrant whose 
registration is cancelled under delegated authority may appeal that 
decision directly to the Commission in accordance with Rules 430 and 
431 of the Commission's rules of practice (17 CFR 201.430 and 431).

ADDRESSES: Secretary, U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission, 100 F 
Street NE, Washington, DC 20549.

FOR FURTHER INFORMATION CONTACT: Mark Elion, Senior Counsel, Office of 
Municipal Securities, 100 F Street NE, Washington, DC 20549, or at

pursuant to delegated authority.\1\
