SECURITIES AND EXCHANGE COMMISSION

[SEC File No. 270-050, OMB Control No. 3235-0060]


Submission for OMB Review; Comment Request; Extension: Exchange 
Act Form 8-K

Upon Written Request Copies Available From: Securities and Exchange 
Commission, Office of FOIA Services, 100 F Street NE, Washington, DC 
20549-2736

    Notice is hereby given that, pursuant to the Paperwork Reduction 
Act of 1995 (44 U.S.C. 3501 et seq.), the Securities and Exchange 
Commission (``Commission'') has submitted to the Office of Management 
and Budget this request for extension of the previously approved 
collection of information discussed below.
    Form 8-K (17 CFR 249.308) is filed by issuers to satisfy their 
current reporting obligations pursuant to Sections 13 and 15(d) of the 
Securities Exchange Act of 1934 (15 U.S.C. 78m and 78o(d)) in 
connection with the occurrence of significant corporate events. The 
purpose of Form 8-K is to provide investors with prompt disclosure of 
material information so that investors will be able to make investment 
and voting decisions better informed and receive information more-
timely. We estimate that Form 8-K takes 8.414583 hours per response and 
is filed by 70,560 responses annually. We estimate that 75% of the 
8.414583 hours per response (6.31094 hours) is prepared by the issuer 
for a total annual reporting burden of 445,300 hours (6.31094 hours per 
response x 70,560 responses).
    An agency may not conduct or sponsor, and a person is not required 
to respond to, a collection of information unless it displays a 
currently valid control number.
    The public may view background documentation for this information 
collection at the following website: <a href="http://www.reginfo.gov">www.reginfo.gov</a>. Find this 
particular information collection by selecting ``Currently under 30-day 
Review--Open for Public Comments'' or by using the search function.

collection should be sent within 30 days of publication of this notice 
by October 15, 2024 to (i) <a href="http://www.reginfo.gov/public/do/PRAMain">www.reginfo.gov/public/do/PRAMain</a> and (ii)

Commission, c/o Oluwaseun Ajayi, 100 F Street NE, Washington, DC 20549,
