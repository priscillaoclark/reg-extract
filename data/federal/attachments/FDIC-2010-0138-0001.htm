    Form Number: None.
    Frequency of Response: Implementation: Once.

    Maintenance: All Banks: 4890.
    Estimated Time per Response: Implementation: Large Banks: 480 
hours. Small Banks: 80 hours.
    Maintenance: Large Banks: 40 hours. Small Banks: 40 hours.
    Total Annual Burden: Large Banks: 20 x 480 + 20 x 40 = 10,400 
hours. Small Banks: 4870 x 80 + 4870 x 40 = 389,600 hours.

safety and soundness of the organization. Under the Guidance, banks 
would be required to: (i) Have policies and procedures that identify 
and describe the role(s) of the personnel and units authorized to be 
involved in incentive compensation arrangements, identify the source of 
significant risk-related inputs, establish appropriate controls 
governing these inputs to help ensure their integrity, and identify the 
individual(s) and unit(s) whose approval is necessary for the 
establishment or modification of incentive compensation arrangements; 
(ii) create and maintain sufficient documentation to permit an audit of 
the organization's processes for incentive compensation arrangements; 
(iii) have any material exceptions or adjustments to the incentive 
compensation arrangements established for senior executives approved 
and documented by its board of directors; and (iv) have its board of 
directors receive and review, on an annual or more frequent basis, an 
assessment by management of the effectiveness of the design and 
operation of the organization's incentive compensation system in 
providing risk-taking incentives that are consistent with the 
organization's safety and soundness.
