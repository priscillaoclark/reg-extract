I. Self-Regulatory Organization's Statement of the Terms of Substance 
of the Proposed Rule Change

    The Exchange proposes to amend the NYSE Arca Equities Fees and 
Charges (``Fee Schedule'') to adopt an alternative requirement to 
qualify for the Tape B Tier 3 pricing tier and increase the cap of the 
additional credit payable for providing liquidity under the Tape B 
Tiers pricing tier. The proposed rule change is available on the 
Exchange's website at <a href="http://www.nyse.com">www.nyse.com</a>, at the principal office of the 
Exchange, and at the Commission's Public Reference Room.

II. Self-Regulatory Organization's Statement of the Purpose of, and 
Statutory Basis for, the Proposed Rule Change

    In its filing with the Commission, the self-regulatory organization 
included statements concerning the purpose of, and basis for, the 
proposed rule change and discussed any comments it received on the 
proposed rule change. The text of those statements may be examined at 
the places specified in Item IV below. The Exchange has prepared 
summaries, set forth in sections A, B, and C below, of the most 
significant parts of such statements.

A. Self-Regulatory Organization's Statement of the Purpose of, and 
Statutory Basis for, the Proposed Rule Change

1. Purpose
    The Exchange proposes to amend the Fee Schedule to adopt an 
alternative requirement to qualify for the Tape B Tier 3 pricing tier 
and increase the cap of the additional credit payable for providing 
liquidity under the Tape B Tiers pricing tier. The Exchange proposes to 
implement the fee changes effective August 14, 2024.\3\
---------------------------------------------------------------------------

    \3\ The Exchange originally filed to amend the Fee Schedule on 
August 1, 2024 (SR-NYSEARCA-2024-64). SR-NYSEARCA-2024-64 was 
subsequently withdrawn and replaced by this filing.
---------------------------------------------------------------------------

Background
    The Exchange operates in a highly competitive market. The 
Commission has repeatedly expressed its preference for competition over 
regulatory intervention in determining prices, products, and services 
in the securities markets. In Regulation NMS, the Commission 
highlighted the importance of market forces in determining prices and 
SRO revenues and, also, recognized that current regulation of the 
market system ``has been remarkably successful in promoting market 
competition in its broader forms that are most important to investors 
and listed companies.'' \4\
---------------------------------------------------------------------------

    \4\ See Securities Exchange Act Release No. 51808 (June 9, 
2005), 70 FR 37496, 37499 (June 29, 2005) (File No. S7-10-04) (Final 
Rule) (``Regulation NMS'').
---------------------------------------------------------------------------

    While Regulation NMS has enhanced competition, it has also fostered 
a ``fragmented'' market structure where trading in a single stock can 
occur across multiple trading centers. When multiple trading centers 
compete for order flow in the same stock, the Commission has recognized 
that ``such competition can lead to the fragmentation of order flow in 
that stock.'' \5\ Indeed, equity trading is currently dispersed across 
16 exchanges,\6\ numerous alternative trading systems,\7\ and broker-
dealer internalizers and wholesalers, all competing for order flow. 
Based on publicly available information, no single exchange currently 
has more than 20% market share.\8\ Therefore, no exchange possesses 
significant pricing power in the execution of equity order flow. More 
specifically, the Exchange currently has less than 12% market share of 
executed volume of equities trading.\9\
---------------------------------------------------------------------------

    \5\ See Securities Exchange Act Release No. 61358, 75 FR 3594,

---------------------------------------------------------------------------

    The Exchange believes that the ever-shifting market share among the 
exchanges from month to month demonstrates that market participants can 
move order flow, or discontinue or reduce use of certain categories of 
products. While it is not possible to know a firm's reason for shifting 
order flow, the Exchange believes that one such reason is because of 
fee changes at any of the registered exchanges or non-exchange venues 
to which the firm routes order flow. With respect to non-marketable 
order flow that would provide liquidity on an Exchange against which 
market makers can quote, ETP Holders can choose from any one of the 16 
currently operating registered exchanges to route such order flow. 
Accordingly, competitive forces compel the Exchange to use exchange 
transaction fees and credits because market participants can readily 
trade on competing venues if they deem pricing levels at those other 
venues to be more favorable.
Proposed Rule Change
Tape B Tier 3
    Currently, under the Tape B Tier 3 pricing tier, an ETP Holder 
could qualify for a credit of $0.0025 per share \10\ for adding 
liquidity in Tape B Securities by meeting one of the following two 
requirements. An ETP Holder could qualify for the current credit if 
such ETP Holder (1) has Adding ADV of Tape B CADV that is equal to at 
least 0.20% of the Tape B CADV and (2) has Market Maker Electronic 
Posting Volume of TCADV of at least 0.50% by an OTP Holder or OTP Firm 
affiliated with the ETP Holder. Alternatively, the ETP Holder could 
qualify for the current credit if such ETP Holder has Adding ADV of 
Tape B CADV that is equal to at least 0.15% over the ETP Holder's April 
2020 Adding ADV taken as a percentage of Tape B CADV.\11\
---------------------------------------------------------------------------

    \10\ Under Section III of the Fee Schedule--Standard Rates, ETP 
Holders receive a credit of $0.0020 per share for orders that add 
liquidity in Tape B securities. Additionally, in securities priced 
at or above $1.00, an additional credit in Tape B securities may be 
available to Lead Market Makers (``LMMs'') and to Market Makers 
affiliated with LMMs that add displayed liquidity based on the 
number of Less Active ETP Securities in which the LMM is registered 
as the LMM. The applicable tiered-credits are noted on the Fee 
Schedule under LMM Transaction Fees and Credits.
    \11\ See Fee Schedule, Tier 3 under Tape B Tiers pricing table.
---------------------------------------------------------------------------

    The Exchange proposes to adopt another alternative method that ETP 
Holders could utilize to qualify for the Tape B Tier 3 credit. As 
proposed, an ETP Holder could qualify for the Tape B Tier 3 credit of 
$0.0025 per share for adding liquidity in Tape B securities if such ETP 
Holder is registered as a Lead Market Maker \12\ or Market Maker \13\ 
in at

[[Page 70243]]

least 50 \14\ Less Active ETPs \15\ in which it meets at least two 
Performance Metrics.\16\ The Exchange is not proposing any change to 
the level of Tape B Tier 3 credits.\17\
---------------------------------------------------------------------------

    \12\ The term ``Lead Market Maker'' is defined in Rule 1.1(w) to 
mean a registered Market Maker that is the exclusive Designated 
Market Maker in listings for which the Exchange is the primary 
market.
    \13\ Pursuant to Rule 7.23-E(a)(1), all registered Market 
Makers, including LMMs, have an obligation to maintain continuous, 
two-sided trading interest in those securities in which the Market 
Marker is registered to trade. In addition, pursuant to Rule 7.24-
E(b), LMMs are held to higher performance standards in the 
securities in which they are registered as LMM. LMMs can earn 
additional financial incentives for meeting the higher performance 
standards specified from time to time in the Fee Schedule. Only one 
LMM can be registered in a NYSE-Arca listed security, but that 
security can have an unlimited number of registered Market Makers. 
Market Makers can also be registered in securities that trade on an 
unlisted trading privileges basis on the Exchange.
    \14\ The number of Less Active ETPs for a billing month would be 
calculated as the average number of Less Active ETPs in which an ETP 
Holder is registered as a LMM or Market Maker on the first and last 
business day of the previous month.
    \15\ Pursuant to Section I under the LMM Transaction Fees and 
Credits, the term ``Less Active ETPs'' means ETPs that have a CADV 
in the prior calendar quarter that is the greater of either less 
than 100,000 shares or less than 0.013% of Consolidated Tape B ADV. 
The term ``ETP'' means Exchange Traded Product listed on NYSE Arca.
    \16\ The applicable Performance Metrics are specified in Section 
III under LMM Transaction Fees and Credits on the Fee Schedule.
    \17\ With this proposed rule change, the Exchange also proposes 
to reformat the Tape B Tiers table by adopting a new column titled 
``NYSE Arca Listed Equities'' with a description in the new column 
of the requirement as proposed in this filing.
---------------------------------------------------------------------------

    The proposed rule change to adopt the proposed alternative method 
to qualify for the existing credit is designed to incentivize ETP 
Holders to increase liquidity-providing orders in NYSE Arca-listed 
securities, including in lower volume securities, in which they are 
registered as a LMM or Market Maker, that they send to the Exchange, 
which would support the quality of price discovery on the Exchange and 
provide additional liquidity for incoming orders for the benefit of all 
market participants.
    The Exchange notes that its listing business operates in a highly 
competitive market in which market participants, including issuers of 
securities, LMMs, and other liquidity providers, can readily transfer 
their listings, or direct order flow to competing venues if they deem 
fee levels, liquidity provision incentive programs, or other factors at 
a particular venue to be insufficient or excessive. The proposed rule 
change reflects the current competitive pricing environment and is 
designed to incentivize market participants to participate as LMMs or 
Market Makers, especially in Less Active ETPs, and thereby, further 
enhance the market quality on such securities listed on the Exchange 
and encourage issuers to list new products on the Exchange.
Tape B--Additional Credit
    The Exchange currently provides an increased cap applicable under 
the Tape B Tiers pricing table. Specifically, if an ETP Holder is 
registered as a LMM or Market Maker in at least 100 Less Active ETPs in 
which it meets at least two Performance Metrics, where the ETP Holder, 
together with any affiliates, has Adding Tape B ADV that is an increase 
of at least 60% over the ETP Holder's Adding ADV in Q3 2019, as a 
percentage of Tape B CADV, then such ETP Holder receives a combined 
credit of up to:
    <bullet> $0.0033 per share if the ETP Holder, together with any 
affiliates, has Tape B Adding ADV equal to at least 0.65% of Tape B 
CADV, or
    <bullet> $0.0034 per share if the ETP Holder, together with any 
affiliates, has Tape B Adding ADV equal to at least 0.70% of Tape B 
CADV.
    The Exchange proposes to increase the combined credit, from $0.0034 
per share to $0.0035 per share, if a qualifying ETP Holder that, 
together with any affiliates, has Tape B Adding ADV equal to at least 
0.70% of Tape B CADV.
    The Exchange believes increasing the combined credit payable to ETP 
Holders, from up to $0.0034 per share to up to $0.0035 per share would 
provide an incentive to ETP Holders to register as LMMs or Market 
Makers and incentivize such liquidity providers to increase the number 
of orders sent to the Exchange.
    The proposed changes are not otherwise intended to address any 
other issues, and the Exchange is not aware of any significant problems 
that market participants would have in complying with the proposed 
changes.
2. Statutory Basis
    The Exchange believes that the proposed rule change is consistent 
with Section 6(b) of the Act,\18\ in general, and furthers the 
objectives of Sections 6(b)(4) and (5) of the Act,\19\ in particular, 
because it provides for the equitable allocation of reasonable dues, 
fees, and other charges among its members, issuers and other persons 
using its facilities and does not unfairly discriminate between 
customers, issuers, brokers or dealers.

    \19\ 15 U.S.C. 78f(b)(4) and (5).
---------------------------------------------------------------------------

    As discussed above, the Exchange operates in a highly fragmented 
and competitive market. The Commission has repeatedly expressed its 
preference for competition over regulatory intervention in determining 
prices, products, and services in the securities markets. Specifically, 
in Regulation NMS, the Commission highlighted the importance of market 
forces in determining prices and SRO revenues and, also, recognized 
that current regulation of the market system ``has been remarkably 
successful in promoting market competition in its broader forms that 
are most important to investors and listed companies.'' \20\ As a 
threshold matter, the Exchange is subject to significant competitive 
forces in the market for equity securities transaction services that 
constrain its pricing determinations in that market.
---------------------------------------------------------------------------

    \20\ See Regulation NMS, supra note 4, 70 FR at 37499.
---------------------------------------------------------------------------

    Numerous indicia demonstrate the competitive nature of this market. 
For example, clear substitutes to the Exchange exist in the market for 
equity security transaction services. The Exchange is only one of 
several equity venues to which market participants may direct their 
order flow. Competing equity exchanges offer similar tiered pricing 
structures to that of the Exchange, including credits and fees that 
apply based upon members achieving certain volume thresholds. The 
Exchange believes that the ever-shifting market share among the 
exchanges from month to month demonstrates that market participants can 
shift order flow, or discontinue or reduce use of certain categories of 
products, in response to fee changes. Accordingly, the Exchange's fees 
are reasonably constrained by competitive alternatives and market 
participants can readily trade on competing venues if they deem pricing 
levels at those other venues to be more favorable.
Tape B Tier 3
    The Exchange believes that the proposal to adopt an alternative 
method to qualify for the Tape B Tier 3 credit is reasonable because it 
provides an additional opportunity for ETP Holders to receive an 
existing rebate on qualifying orders in a manner that incentivizes 
order flow on the Exchange. The Exchange believes the proposed 
alternative method to qualify for the Tape B Tier 3 pricing tier is 
reasonable because it provides ETP Holders with an additional way to 
qualify for the pricing tier's credit by incentivizing ETP Holders to 
increase liquidity-providing orders in NYSE Arca-listed securities, 
including in lower volume securities, in which they are registered as a 
LMM or Market Maker, that they send to the Exchange, which would 
support the quality of price discovery on the Exchange and provide 
additional liquidity for incoming orders for the benefit of all market 
participants. The Exchange also believes it is reasonable to require 
ETP Holders to register as a LMM or Market Maker in a minimum number of 
Less Active ETPs and to meet at least two Performance Metrics in such 
securities as the Exchange believes this requirement would enhance 
market

[[Page 70244]]

quality in Less Active ETPs and support the quality of price discovery 
in such securities.
    The Exchange believes the proposed change to adopt an alternative 
method to qualify for existing credits is reasonable as these changes 
would provide an incentive for ETP Holders to direct their order flow 
to the Exchange and provide meaningful added levels of liquidity in 
order to qualify for the existing credit, thereby contributing to depth 
and market quality on the Exchange. As noted above, the Exchange 
operates in a highly competitive environment, particularly for 
attracting order flow that provides displayed liquidity on an exchange. 
More specifically, the Exchange notes that greater add volume order 
flow may provide for deeper, more liquid markets and execution 
opportunities at improved prices, which the Exchange believes would 
incentivize liquidity providers to submit additional liquidity and 
enhance execution opportunities.
    The Exchange believes that the proposal to adopt an alternative 
method to qualify for the Tape B Tier 3 credit represents an equitable 
allocation of fees and credits and is not unfairly discriminatory 
because it would apply uniformly to all ETP Holders, in that all ETP 
Holders would be eligible for the existing credit and have the 
opportunity to meet the tier's criteria by registering as a LMM or 
Market Maker in a Less Active ETP and meeting the market quality 
metrics. The Exchange believes that the proposal to offer rebates tied 
to market quality metrics represents an equitable allocation of 
payments because LMMs and Market Makers would be required to not only 
meet their Rule 7.23-E obligations, but also meet prescribed quoting 
requirements in order to qualify for the credit. Further, all LMMs and 
Market Makers on the Exchange are eligible to participate and could do 
so by simply registering in a Less Active ETP and meeting the proposed 
market quality metrics.
    Under the proposal, the existing rebate would apply automatically 
and uniformly to all ETP Holders that register as a LMM or Market Maker 
in at least 50 Less Active ETPs in which it meets at least two 
Performance Metrics.
    While the Exchange has no way of knowing whether the proposed 
alternative method to qualify for the Tape B Tier 3 pricing tier would 
definitively result in any particular ETP Holder qualifying for the 
existing credit, the Exchange anticipates a number of ETP Holders will 
seek to qualify for the rebate by registering as a LMM or Market Maker 
in at least 50 Less Active ETPs and meet the required performance 
metrics.
    The Exchange believes it is not unfairly discriminatory to provide 
an alternative way to qualify for the per share credit under the Tape B 
Tier 3 pricing tier, as the credit would be provided on an equal basis 
to all ETP Holders that meet the proposed requirement. Further, the 
Exchange believes the proposed alternative method would incentivize ETP 
Holders to register in Less Active ETPs and send more order to the 
Exchange to qualify for the Tape B Tier 3 credit.
    The Exchange believes that the proposed alternative method to 
qualify for the Tape B Tier 3 credit is not unfairly discriminatory 
because it would be available to all ETP Holders on an equal and non-
discriminatory basis. In this regard, the Exchange notes that ETP 
Holders that do not meet the proposed alternative criteria would 
continue to have the opportunity to qualify for the Tape B Tier 3 
credit by satisfying the two current requirements, which would not 
change as a result of this proposal.
    The Exchange also believes that the proposed rule change is not 
unfairly discriminatory because it is reasonably related to the value 
to the Exchange's market quality associated with higher volumes. The 
Exchange believes that increased liquidity and higher volumes improves 
market quality on the Exchange, which increases the likelihood of 
orders being executed at prices desired by ETP Holders and thereby 
incentivizing ETP Holders to direct more order flow to the Exchange. 
The Exchange places a higher value on displayed liquidity because the 
Exchange believes that displayed liquidity is a public good that 
benefits investors generally by providing greater price transparency 
and enhancing price discovery on a public exchange, which ultimately 
lead to substantial reductions in transaction costs.
    The proposed change to the Tape B Tier 3 pricing tier is designed 
as an incentive to ETP Holders interested in meeting the tier criteria 
to submit additional order flow to the Exchange and each will receive 
the existing rebate if the tier criteria is met. The Exchange also 
notes that the proposed rule change will not adversely impact any ETP 
Holder's pricing or its ability to qualify for other tiers. Rather, 
should an ETP Holder not meet the Tape B Tier 3 pricing tier's 
criteria, the ETP Holder will merely not receive the corresponding 
rebate.
Tape B--Additional Credit
    The Exchange believes the proposed rule change to increase the 
combined credit, from up to $0.0034 per share to up to $0.0035 per 
share, payable to ETP Holders if an ETP Holder, together with any 
affiliates, has Tape B Adding ADV equal to at least 0.70% of Tape B 
CADV is a reasonable means of attracting additional liquidity to the 
Exchange. The Exchange believes the increased financial incentive, 
which is among the highest paid by the Exchange, would encourage ETP 
Holders to submit additional liquidity to a national securities 
exchange and receive the proposed higher rebate. The Exchange believes 
it is reasonable to require ETP Holders to meet the applicable volume 
threshold to qualify for the increased credit, given the higher 
combined credit up to of $0.0035 per share that the Exchange would pay 
if the tier criteria were met.
    The Exchange believes that submission of increased liquidity to the 
Exchange would promote price discovery and transparency and enhance 
order execution opportunities for ETP Holders from the substantial 
amounts of liquidity present on the Exchange. The Exchange also 
believes it is reasonable to require ETP Holders to register as a LMM 
or Market Maker in a minimum number of Less Active ETPs and to meet at 
least two Performance Metrics in such securities as the Exchange 
believes this requirement would enhance market quality in Less Active 
ETPs and support the quality of price discovery in such securities.
    The Exchange believes the proposed rule change to increase the 
combined credit, from up to $0.0034 per share to up to $0.0035 per 
share, payable to ETP Holders if a ETP Holder, together with any 
affiliates, has Tape B Adding ADV equal to at least 0.70% of Tape B 
CADV equitably allocates its fees and credits among market participants 
because it is reasonably related to the value of the Exchange's market 
quality associated with higher equities volumes. The Exchange believes 
that increased liquidity and higher volumes improves market quality on 
the Exchange, which increases the likelihood of orders being executed 
at prices desired by ETP Holders and thereby incentivizing ETP Holders 
to direct more order flow to the Exchange. The Exchange places a higher 
value on displayed liquidity because the Exchange believes that 
displayed liquidity is a public good that benefits investors generally 
by providing greater price transparency and enhancing price discovery 
on a public exchange, which ultimately lead to substantial reductions

[[Page 70245]]

in transaction costs. As proposed, the Exchange would continue to 
provide qualifying ETP Holders with some of the highest credits payable 
by the Exchange provided they continue to participate as LMMs or Market 
Makers and continue to provide increased Tape B adding ADV. The more an 
ETP Holder participates, the greater the credit that ETP Holder would 
receive. The Exchange believes the proposed increase credit would 
encourage ETP Holders to continue to send orders that add liquidity to 
the Exchange, thereby contributing to robust levels of liquidity, which 
would benefit all market participants.
    The Exchange believes it is not unfairly discriminatory to increase 
the combined credit payable to ETP Holders because the increased 
credits would be paid to all ETP Holders that qualify for the credit on 
an equal basis. Additionally, the proposed rule change to increase the 
combined credit payable to qualifying ETP Holders neither targets nor 
will it have a disparate impact on any particular category of market 
participant.
    On the backdrop of the competitive environment in which the 
Exchange currently operates, the proposed rule change is a reasonable 
attempt by the Exchange to maintain, if not improve its market share 
relative to its competitors.
    Finally, the submission of orders to the Exchange is optional for 
ETP Holders in that they could choose whether to submit orders to the 
Exchange and, if they do, the extent of its activity in this regard. 
The Exchange believes that it is subject to significant competitive 
forces, as described below in the Exchange's statement regarding the 
burden on competition.
    For the foregoing reasons, the Exchange believes that the proposal 
is consistent with the Act.

B. Self-Regulatory Organization's Statement on Burden on Competition

    In accordance with Section 6(b)(8) of the Act,\21\ the Exchange 
believes that the proposed rule change would not impose any burden on 
competition that is not necessary or appropriate in furtherance of the 
purposes of the Act.
---------------------------------------------------------------------------

    \21\ 15 U.S.C. 78f(b)(8).
---------------------------------------------------------------------------

    Intramarket Competition. The Exchange believes the proposed 
amendment to its Fee Schedule would not impose any burden on 
competition that is not necessary or appropriate in furtherance of the 
purposes of the Act. The Exchange does not believe that the proposed 
change represents a significant departure from previous pricing offered 
by the Exchange or its competitors. The proposed change is designed to 
attract additional order flow to the Exchange, in particular with 
respect to Tape B securities. The Exchange believes that the proposed 
adoption of an alternative method to qualify for an established credit 
under the Tape B Tier 3 pricing tier would incentivize market 
participants to participate as LMMs or Market Makers and direct 
liquidity adding order flow to the Exchange, bringing with it 
additional execution opportunities for market participants and improved 
price transparency. Greater overall order flow, trading opportunities, 
and pricing transparency would benefit all market participants on the 
Exchange by enhancing market quality and would continue to encourage 
ETP Holders to send orders to the Exchange, thereby contributing 
towards a robust and well-balanced market ecosystem.
    Intermarket Competition. The Exchange operates in a highly 
competitive market in which market participants can readily choose to 
send their orders to other exchanges and off-exchange venues if they 
deem fee levels at those other venues to be more favorable. As noted 
above, the Exchange's market share of intraday trading (i.e., excluding 
auctions) is currently less than 12%. In such an environment, the 
Exchange must continually review, and consider adjusting its fees and 
credits to remain competitive with other exchanges and with off-
exchange venues. Because competitors are free to modify their own fees 
and credits in response, the Exchange does not believe its proposed fee 
change can impose any burden on intermarket competition.
    The Exchange believes that the proposed change could promote 
competition between the Exchange and other execution venues, including 
those that currently offer comparable transaction pricing, by 
encouraging additional orders to be sent to the Exchange for execution.

C. Self-Regulatory Organization's Statement on Comments on the Proposed 
Rule Change Received From Members, Participants, or Others

    No written comments were solicited or received with respect to the 
proposed rule change.

III. Date of Effectiveness of the Proposed Rule Change and Timing for 
Commission Action

    The foregoing rule change has become effective upon filing pursuant 
to Section 19(b)(3)(A) \22\ of the Act and paragraph (f) thereunder. At 
any time within 60 days of the filing of the proposed rule change, the 
Commission summarily may temporarily suspend such rule change if it 
appears to the Commission that such action is necessary or appropriate 
in the public interest, for the protection of investors, or otherwise 
in furtherance of the purposes of the Act.
