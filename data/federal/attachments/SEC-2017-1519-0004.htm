SECURITIES AND EXCHANGE COMMISSION

[SEC File No. 270-213, OMB Control No. 3235-0220]


Proposed Collection; Comment Request; Extension: Rule 30b2-1

Upon Written Request, Copies Available From: Securities and Exchange 
Commission, Office of FOIA Services, 100 F Street NE, Washington, DC 
20549-2736

    Notice is hereby given that, pursuant to the Paperwork Reduction 
Act of 1995 (44 U.S.C. 3501 et seq.), the Securities and Exchange 
Commission (the ``Commission'') is soliciting comments on the 
collection of information summarized below. The Commission plans to 
submit the existing collection of information to the Office of 
Management and Budget (``OMB'') for extension and approval.
    Rule 30b2-1 (17 CFR 270.30b2-1) under the Investment Company Act of 
1940 (15 U.S.C. 80a-1 et seq.) (the

[[Page 84026]]

``Investment Company Act'') requires a registered management investment 
company (``fund'') to (1) file a report with the Commission on Form N-
CSR (17 CFR 249.331 and 274.128) not later than 10 days after the 
transmission of any report required to be transmitted to shareholders 
under rule 30e-1 under the Investment Company Act, and (2) file with 
the Commission a copy of every periodic or interim report or similar 
communication containing financial statements that is transmitted by or 
on behalf of such fund to any class of such fund's security holders and 
that is not required to be filed with the Commission under (1) above, 
not later than 10 days after the transmission to security holders. The 
purpose of the collection of information required by rule 30b2-1 is to 
meet the disclosure requirements of the Investment Company Act and 
certification requirements of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act of 2002 (Pub. L. 
107-204, 116 Stat. 745 (2002)), and to provide investors with 
information necessary to evaluate an interest in the fund.
    The Commission estimates that there are 2,728 funds, with a total 
of 13,449 portfolios, that are governed by the rule. For purposes of 
this analysis, the burden associated with the requirements of rule 
30b2-1 has been included in the collection of information requirements 
of rule 30e-1 (17 CFR 270.30e-1) and Form N-CSR, rather than the rule. 
The rule 30b2-1 information collection, however, imposes a one hour 
burden for administrative purposes and we are maintaining that one hour 
burden.
    The collection of information under rule 30b2-1 is mandatory. The 
information provided under rule 30b2-1 is not kept confidential. An 
agency may not conduct or sponsor, and a person is not required to 
respond to, a collection of information unless it displays a currently 
valid OMB control number.
    Written comments are invited on: (a) whether the proposed 
collection of information is necessary for the proper performance of 
the functions of the Commission, including whether the information 
shall have practical utility; (b) the accuracy of the Commission's 
estimate of the burden of the collection of information; (c) ways to 
enhance the quality, utility, and clarity of the information collected; 
and (d) ways to minimize the burden of the collection of information on 
respondents, including through the use of automated collection 
techniques or other forms of information technology. Consideration will 
be given to comments and suggestions submitted by January 30, 2024.
    An agency may not conduct or sponsor, and a person is not required 
to respond to, a collection of information under the PRA unless it 
displays a currently valid OMB control number.
    Please direct your written comments to: David Bottom, Acting 
Director/Chief Information Officer, Securities and Exchange Commission, 
c/o John Pezzullo, 100 F Street NE, Washington, DC 20549 or send an 
email to: <a href="/cdn-cgi/l/email-protection#88d8dac9d7c5e9e1e4eae7f0c8fbedeba6efe7fe"><span class="__cf_email__" data-cfemail="247476657b69454d48464b5c645741470a434b52">[email&#160;protected]</span></a>.

    Dated: November 27, 2023.
Christina Z. Milnor,
Assistant Secretary.
