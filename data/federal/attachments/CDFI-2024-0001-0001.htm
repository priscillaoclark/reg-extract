SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION:

I. Background

    The Capital Magnet Fund (CMF) was established through the Housing 
and Economic Recovery Act of 2008 (the Act), Public Law 110-289, 
section 1131, as a trust fund to carry out a competitive grant program 
administered by the CDFI Fund. The mission of the CDFI Fund is to 
increase economic opportunity and promote community development 
investments for underserved populations and in distressed communities 
in the United States. Its long-term vision is an America in which all 
people have access to affordable credit, capital, and financial 
services. Between fiscal year 2010 and fiscal year 2023, the CDFI Fund 
administered a total of eight CMF Application rounds, obligating nearly 
$1.1 billion in total awards. Since the last update to the rule in 
2016, there have been changes in business practices in the affordable 
housing industry and regulatory requirements in other relevant Federal 
affordable housing assistance programs. Accordingly, the CDFI Fund is 
promulgating this revised interim rule: to streamline and update terms, 
concepts, and provisions in order to improve the public's understanding 
and administration of the CMF program requirements; to better align the 
CMF with other Federal housing assistance programs; and to better 
reflect current business practices in the affordable housing industry.
    Through the CMF, the CDFI Fund is authorized to make financial 
assistance grants to Certified Community Development Financial 
Institutions (CDFIs) and Nonprofit Organizations that have a principal 
purpose which is the development or management of affordable housing. 
CMF Awards must be used to attract private financing for and increase 
investment in the Development, Preservation, Rehabilitation, and 
Purchase of Affordable Housing primarily for Extremely Low-Income, Very 
Low-Income, and Low-Income Families and Economic Development Activities 
which, in conjunction with Affordable Housing Activities, will 
stabilize or revitalize a Low-Income Area or Underserved Rural Area.
    All capitalized terms herein are defined in the definitions section 
of this revised interim rule, as set forth in 12 CFR 1807.104.

II. Comments on the February 8, 2016, Interim Rule

    The current version of the rule is an Interim Rule that went into 
effect on February 8, 2016. The comment period for the February 8, 
2016, Interim Rule (``2016 interim rule'') ended on April 8, 2016. The 
CDFI Fund received eight written submissions.

A. 12 CFR 1807.104. Definitions

    The CDFI Fund received two comments related to the definition of 
``Affordable Housing Fund.'' One commenter suggested that the 
definition should be revised to mean a revolving loan, grant, or 
investment fund that may be formed as a separate legal entity, managed 
by the Recipient and for which its capital is used to finance 
Affordable Housing Activities. A second commenter suggested that the 
term ``Revolving Fund'' be removed from the definition of ``Affordable 
Housing Fund'' since not all Affordable Housing Funds will revolve and 
noted there is a separate definition in the 2016 interim rule for a 
``Revolving Loan Fund.'' The CDFI Fund appreciates these comments and 
incorporates debt, grant, and equity investments into the definition of 
``Affordable Housing Fund.'' The CDFI Fund has also removed the phrase 
``revolving fund'' from the definition, as reflected in the revised 
interim rule. Capitalizing a Revolving Loan Fund is now a separate 
Eligible Use, a newly defined term in the revised interim rule, of the 
CMF Award. Additionally, the CDFI Fund notes that, under the revised 
definition of Affordable Housing Fund, Recipients may continue to 
capitalize an Affordable Housing Fund through a single purpose entity--
which must be approved in advance by the CDFI Fund to carry out CMF 
activities--as further detailed under the terms of an Assistance 
Agreement. One commenter stated that the definition of 
``Homeownership'' did not include cooperative or mutual housing. The 
CDFI Fund appreciates this comment and notes that under the 2016 
interim rule, the definition of ``Homeownership'' includes ownership in 
a cooperative housing or mutual housing project as a qualified form of 
ownership notwithstanding the fact that the Recipient is required to 
determine whether such ownership or membership constitutes 
``Homeownership'' under State law. To minimize confusion and alleviate 
concerns, the definition of ``Homeownership'' in the revised interim 
rule clearly states that Homeownership includes ownership interest in 
``condominium, cooperative, mutual housing, or ground lease title 
interest,'' as allowed under State law in Single-family housing or 
manufactured housing unit.

B. 12 CFR 1807.402--Affordable Housing Homeownership

    Several commenters expressed concern that the recoupment and 
replacement requirement for Homeownership units sold before the end of 
the Affordability Period set forth at 12 CFR 1807.402(a)(5) in the 2016 
interim rule could be a barrier when using the CMF Award to support 
Homeownership or result in disincentivizing mortgage originators from 
using the CMF Award in underwriting loans. One commenter suggested that 
deed-restricted sales capping the resale value of the Housing make 
selling such mortgages on the secondary market very challenging. The 
CDFI Fund appreciates the comments and recognizes the commenters' 
concerns related to the recoupment and replacement requirements in the 
2016 interim rule. To alleviate some of the commenters' concerns, the 
CDFI Fund updated the redesignated 12 CFR 1807.402(a)(1)(vi) in the 
revised interim rule to require recoupment and replacement of the 
Housing only when the resale to an unqualified Homebuyer occurs any 
time during the first five years after the date of Purchase. When the 
resale to an unqualified Homebuyer occurs any time during year six 
through the end of the Affordability Period, the CMF investment will be 
recouped

[[Page 53006]]

proportionally; however, the Recipient is not required to replace the 
sold Housing unit with another Housing unit. Recoupment of the CMF 
investment is Program Income, as described in the Assistance Agreement.
    One commenter suggested that the CDFI Fund create a separate 
allocation of the CMF Awards specifically for Homeownership applicants. 
The CDFI Fund appreciates the commenter's suggestion, but making an 
allocation of the CMF Awards to a select group of applicants is not 
authorized under the Act.

C. Economic Development Activities

    Two commenters stated that there should not be a limit on the use 
of the CMF Award for Economic Development Activities, as the statute 
establishing the CMF does not set a limit. The commenters recommended 
that if a limit were to be established, it should be clarified in the 
Notice of Funds Availability and not in the regulations. The CDFI Fund 
appreciates the comments and finds limiting the use of the CMF Award 
for Economic Development Activities to no more than 30 percent to be 
appropriate and necessary. This ceiling ensures that the CMF Award is 
primarily used to maintain and increase affordable housing, which 
appears to be the more dominant focus of the Act. Further, this 
requirement has not proven to be a barrier to Recipients over the life 
of the program. Since the Fiscal Year 2016 CMF round, only $3.5 million 
in CMF Awards have financed/supported 11 Projects with Economic 
Development Activities. This represents less than one percent of the 
CMF Awards disbursed to all CMF Projects. Section 1807.302(c) in the 
2016 interim rule, which discusses the limitation on the use of the 
Economic Development Activities, has been redesignated as Sec.  
1807.403 in the revised interim rule.
    One commenter suggested that the definition of ``Economic 
Development Activity'' not only apply to physical structures such as 
buildings, but also include loans to businesses for working capital and 
equipment. The CDFI Fund appreciates the comment and notes that while 
extending business loans plays an important role related to Economic 
Development Activities, the primary purpose of the CMF is to promote 
the increase of affordable housing by assisting Recipients with the 
purchase, development, preservation and rehabilitation of structures, 
such as Multi-family rental or Single-family housing, and related 
Community Service Facilities and real estate properties in order to 
revitalize neighborhoods across the country. Accordingly, the CDFI Fund 
did not make that change to the definition of ``Economic Development 
Activity'' in the revised interim rule at Sec.  1807.104.
    Two commenters expressed concern with the definition of ``Concerted 
Strategy'' as it relates to Economic Development Activities. The 
commenters recommended that the CDFI Fund accept a less formal document 
to evidence a Concerted Strategy and remove the requirement that 
Economic Development Activities to be located physically proximate to 
affordable housing. The CDFI Fund appreciates the comments and notes 
that the definition of ``Concerted Strategy'' in the revised interim 
rule reinforces the standard that Economic Development Activities must 
be part of a local or regional planning document adopted by the 
jurisdiction. This ensures that the Economic Development Activities are 
consistent with and reflective of the local vision, are part of a 
strategy with a geographic focus, and that support synergy amongst 
community effort, private investment, and affordable housing. The CDFI 
Fund did not change the documentary requirement in the revised interim 
rule at Sec.  1807.403(d). The definition of ``Concerted Strategy'' 
also remains unchanged in the revised interim rule at Sec.  1807.104, 
and as further detailed in Sec.  1807.403(c).

D. Preservation

    Some commenters opined on the definition of ``Preservation.'' These 
comments reflect concern that the current definition of 
``Preservation'' could limit activities to only those that involve 
refinancing. Another commenter recommended that the current definition 
of ``Preservation'' clarify that acquisition-lending to purchase land 
or existing housing is an eligible use of the CMF Award. Other 
commenters suggested replacing the term ``refinancing'' with 
``recapitalizing,'' or adding ``recapitalizing'' to the definition of 
``Preservation.'' Other comments suggest allowing CMF Recipients to 
combine the CMF Awards with financial assistance from other CDFI Fund 
programs, as well as local and State affordable housing programs, as a 
way to fully capture all possible ``Preservation'' initiatives. The 
CDFI Fund appreciates the comments and notes that the definition of 
``Preservation'' in the revised interim rule is modified to add the 
term ``recapitalization'' and reflects acquisition, refinancing, 
recapitalization, and/or rehabilitation of Multi-family rental housing 
or Single-family housing as Eligible Uses of the CMF Award. Recipients 
can use the CMF Award in concert with financial assistance from local 
and State affordable housing programs, as well as with other CDFI Fund 
programs subject to the restrictions provided in the respective 
Assistance Agreements designed to avoid duplication or over-
subsidization. The revised interim rule further clarifies that 
``Preservation'' activities must involve Projects without prior rent 
restrictions, or Projects with existing affordability rent restrictions 
that are set to expire during the Investment Period or expire at other 
timeframes as determined by the CDFI Fund. For those Projects without 
existing affordability rent restrictions, the CMF investment will 
impose a new affordability rent restriction of at least 10 years, or 
other time period set forth in any applicable NOFA issued by the CDFI 
Fund. For those Projects with expiring affordability rent restrictions, 
the CMF investment must create at least an additional 10 years of 
affordability or other time period set forth in the applicable NOFA 
issued by the CDFI Fund. This ensures CMF Awards are used in Projects 
that are at an imminent risk of losing their affordability, and also 
implements new affordability requirements for those Projects without 
existing rent restrictions.

E. Underserved Rural Areas

    One commenter suggested that the CDFI Fund change the criteria for 
what qualifies as an ``Underserved Rural Area(s)'' as it appears in the 
definition in the 2016 interim rule. The commenter suggested that one 
of the qualifying factors should be the total prior five years per 
capita dollars of all Federal assistance (not specific to the CMF 
Award) used to develop or rehabilitate affordable housing. The CDFI 
Fund appreciates the comment and notes that this recommendation is not 
administratively feasible. The CDFI Fund further notes that the revised 
interim rule includes a new definition, ``Rural Area,'' which mirrors 
the definition in 12 CFR 1282.1 (Enterprise Duty to Serve Final Rule) 
and replaces the term ``Underserved Rural Area.''

F. Miscellaneous Comments

    The CDFI Fund considered several comments despite the fact that 
they did not pertain to the specific changes being made in the 2016 
revised interim rule. Six comments referred to the ``High Housing 
Need'' geographic designation which is no longer a part of the CMF 
program criteria. Eight comments were about the 2016 CMF Application or

[[Page 53007]]

Application process. The CDFI Fund notes that these Application-related 
requirements are set forth in Sec. Sec.  1807.800 and 1807.801 of the 
revised interim rule. They remain unchanged except for the deletion of 
Sec. Sec.  1807.801(b)(1) through (b)(4) which were deleted due to 
redundancy. Two other comments were about the reporting requirements 
for Economic Development Activities and Program Income. These 
requirements are more appropriate for the CMF Assistance Agreement and 
other CMF guidance and materials. Another commenter noted that the 2016 
interim rule omits any mention of fair housing which is not correct. 
The CDFI Fund refers to fair housing in Sec.  1807.503(b)(2)(i) of the 
revised interim rule, which remains unchanged.

III. Comments on the July 7, 2023, Notice and Request for Information

    This revised interim rule addresses and incorporates written 
comments the CDFI Fund received in response to the Notice and Request 
for Information (RFI) that was published in the Federal Register on 
July 7, 2023. The CDFI Fund issued the RFI to enhance and improve the 
efforts of the CMF program to create and preserve affordable housing 
across the country, minimize administrative burden on program 
applicants and award recipients, and safeguard public funds. The CDFI 
Fund received over 40 pieces of correspondence in response to the RFI. 
Public comments that are within the scope of the revised interim rule 
are summarized and addressed in the following paragraphs.
    Numerous commenters responded to the CDFI Fund's request for input 
about how to facilitate CMF program alignment with other Federal 
affordable housing programs. They recommended that aligning the CMF 
with other Federal programs, particularly the Low-Income Housing Tax 
Credit (LIHTC) program, would reduce administration burden and prevent 
duplication of compliance reporting requirements. Additional Federal 
housing programs that commenters mentioned for alignment included the 
HUD HOME Investment Partnership Program, HUD Section 8 Housing Choice 
Voucher Program, United States Department of Agriculture (USDA) Rural 
Development Section 515 Rural Rental Housing Program, and Section 502 
Direct Loan Program. One commenter stated that aligning the CMF with 
other Federal housing programs allows for a cohesive structure within 
the affordable housing industry and promotes administrative 
efficiencies. The CDFI Fund appreciates the comments and the revised 
interim rule introduces a new concept, Presumptively Compliant, as set 
forth in Sec.  1807.106, and defined as ``Presumptively Compliant'' or 
``Presumptive Compliance'' in Sec.  1807.104. Under the Presumptively 
Compliant concept, certain CMF Affordable Housing projects that are 
also funded under other designated Federal housing programs and subject 
to certain rules and restrictions that are similar to those under the 
CMF program. Subject to verification by the CDFI Fund and as further 
set forth in the Assistance Agreement and guidance, these projects 
would be presumed to meet certain CMF rules and requirements, as long 
as those projects are deemed compliant under applicable designated 
Federal housing programs.
    In response to RFI questions about aligning income definitions and 
recertifying tenant income, some commenters stated that the definition 
of ``Very Low-Income'' should be adjusted from the current definition 
of 50 percent of the Area Median Income (AMI) to 60 percent AMI to 
align with LIHTC. They suggested this would increase administrative 
efficiencies, reduce reporting requirements, and make the CMF more 
attractive as an additional funding source for LIHTC projects. Some 
commenters also recommended that the CDFI Fund revise CMF income 
certification requirements to align with LIHTC to avoid duplicating 
reporting requirements and reduce administrative burden. The CDFI Fund 
appreciates the comments and in response, changed the definition of 
``Very Low-Income'' in the revised interim rule from 50 percent AMI and 
below, to 60 percent AMI and below. In addition, the CDFI Fund will no 
longer require the annual tenant income recertification for Projects 
where 100 percent of the units are subject to CMF affordability 
restrictions; the CDFI Fund will set forth additional parameters in the 
Assistance Agreement.
    In response to a question in the RFI related to Project Commitment 
requirements, several commenters requested programmatic flexibility and 
expressed support for a new Commitment process. The CDFI Fund 
appreciates the comments and accordingly revises the interim rule to 
include a new Commitment process in Sec.  1807.501. Under the revised 
interim rule, the CMF Award must first be Committed for Use to at least 
one of the Eligible Uses set forth in Sec.  1807.301 within two years 
of receiving the CMF Award. In addition to the requirement that the CMF 
Award be Committed for Use within two years, in order to ensure that 
the CMF Awards are committed to specific projects, a Recipient must 
make a Project Commitment within three years of receiving the CMF 
Award. This change will allow Recipients one additional year to source 
qualified projects during the Investment Period.
    With respect to the use of Program Income (PI), some commenters 
recommended easing the current restrictions which required Recipients 
to only engage in activities designated in the Assistance Agreement. 
They recommended that the CDFI Fund allow Recipients to use PI for all 
CMF ``eligible activities.'' The CDFI Fund appreciates the comments and 
notes that Recipients' use of PI will continue to be detailed in the 
Assistance Agreement, which gives the CDFI Fund the appropriate 
flexibility to implement any updates to its policy on a more frequent 
basis and communicate them as such.
    A number of commenters recommended changing or eliminating the 
limit on the purchase price of Homeownership Housing financed with the 
CMF Award. The current limit set forth in the 2016 interim rule is no 
more than 95 percent of the area median purchase price as determined by 
HUD under the HOME Investment Partnership Program (HOME Program). The 
CDFI Fund appreciates the comments and notes that the index used to set 
purchase price limits in Sec. Sec.  1807.402(a)(1)(ii) and (b)(1) of 
the revised interim rule is revised to mirror the limits set forth in 
the HUD FHA Section 203(b) Mortgage Insurance Program. While some 
commenters suggested using other indices, such as four times the area 
median income or state housing finance agency limits, the CDFI Fund 
deems the FHA 203(b) limits to be a more reliable and effective index, 
and better reflective of current market conditions.
    A few commenters recommended establishing a new minimum compliance 
period for Economic Development Activities financed using a CMF Award. 
The CDFI Fund appreciates these comments and Sec.  1807.403 in the 
revised interim rule now includes a minimum compliance period of three 
years for Economic Development Activities. One commenter inquired about 
the leveraged costs and the associated calculation to meet the 
requirement. The CDFI Fund appreciates the comment and notes that the 
requested information appears in the Assistance Agreement.

IV. Summary of Changes

A. Overview

    The revised interim rule strikes and replaces existing 12 CFR part 
1807 in its entirety. Principal changes include, among other things, a 
clarification of CMF terms, concepts and requirements to improve 
Recipients' understanding of their obligations and requirements under 
the CMF program; a revision of CMF program requirements to better 
address activities and current business practices in the affordable 
housing industry; the addition of a new section, Sec.  1807.403, 
detailing parameters related to Economic Development Activities; and a 
new eligibility requirement regarding Nonprofit Organizations wherein 
they are required to be designated as such under the laws of the 
organization's State or Indian Tribe of formation, be exempt from 
Federal income taxation pursuant to Sec.  501(c)(3) of the Internal 
Revenue Code--with the exception of organization affiliated with Indian 
Tribes--and be able to demonstrate that a share of its total assets is 
dedicated to the development or management of affordable housing. The 
revised interim rule also deletes and adds new definitions in Sec.  
1807.104, replaces title heading and content in Sec.  1807.106, and 
redesignates, adds or deletes subsections in Sec. Sec.  1807.300, 
1807.400, 1807.401, 1807.402, 1807.500, 1807.501, 1807.503, 1807.801 
and 1807.902. Other changes that provide further clarification and 
elimination of redundancies are identified and discussed further below.
    The following is a section-by-section overview of the amendments in 
this rulemaking.

B. Description of the Revised Interim Rule

    The changes to the 2016 interim rule as provided in the revised 
interim rule, on a section-by-section basis, are as follows:
Subpart A--General Provisions
    The change to Sec.  1807.100 clarifies that CMF activities must 
take place in the United States, specifically, ``every State of the 
United States, the District of Columbia, or territories of the United 
States.'' The revision to Sec.  1807.101(a) clarifies that CDFIs must 
be certified by the CDFI Fund. The term ``merit-based'' in Sec.  
1807.101(b) is deleted, leaving only ``competitive,'' as a technical 
correction. The CMF Application process has always been and remains a 
competitive one. The term ``eligible uses'' in Sec.  1807.101(b) is 
replaced with the defined term ``Eligible Uses'' in Sec.  1807.104 to 
align with the terminology used in the Act, and is further described in 
Sec.  1807.301. Section 1807.102 is revised by removing references to 
specific CDFI Fund programs to accommodate any future changes or 
additions to CDFI Fund programs; a corresponding change is made to 
delete the phrase ``Notice of Funds Availability, Notice of Guarantee 
Availability, or Notice of Allocation Availability,'' and replaced with 
the phrase ``are set forth in the applicable funding notice.''
    There are a number of changes to the definitions in Sec.  1807.104. 
A new term ``Affordability Period'' is added to establish a period of 
at least 10 years or other longer time period set forth in the 
applicable NOFA issued by the CDFI Fund. This will give the CDFI Fund 
the flexibility to extend the affordability requirement, which was set 
at 10 years in the 2016 interim rule. The term ``Affordable Housing 
Activities'' is revised to deem Secondary Market Mortgage Purchase, a 
new term being introduced in the revised interim rule, as allowable 
under the definition. This change codifies a regulatory waiver 
articulated in the Fiscal Year 2023 NOFA related to Secondary Market 
Mortgage Purchases, to deem the use of a CMF Award for the direct 
purchase of Secondary Market Mortgages as allowable pursuant to the CMF 
program requirements. The term ``Affordable Housing Fund'' is revised 
by clarifying that it is an investment fund consisting of the CMF Award 
and any Leveraged Capital that a Recipient manages and uses to finance 
Affordable Housing Activities. Specifically, a Recipient may use an 
Affordable Housing Fund for leveraging purposes by making any 
combination of debt, grant, or equity investments, but excludes the 
purchase of stock, securities, or the buy-out of partnership interest. 
A new term ``Application'' is added to refer to the CDFI Fund's CMF 
application, including any written and verbal information in connection 
therewith, and any exhibits, attachments, appendices and/or written or 
verbal supplements thereto. A new term ``CMF Unit'' is added to 
facilitate the understanding and applicability of program performance 
goals and compliance requirements. The definition implements threshold 
requirements that units financed with a CMF Award, at a minimum, have 
separate kitchen and bath facilities, except for single room 
occupancies, assisted living facilities, and group homes. The term 
``Committed'' is changed to ``Committed for Use,'' but the definition 
remains the same. This change accommodates a new Commitment process for 
the CMF Awards, which better reflects the Act and affords Recipients 
more time to meet the Project Commitment requirements. The term 
``Community Service Facility'' is revised to clarify that the 
associated costs and expenses for services rendered at such facilities 
must directly benefit nearby residents of affordable housing. Some 
examples of such service programs include health care, childcare, 
educational programs, job training, food and nutrition services, art 
and social services, as further specified in the Assistance Agreement. 
The term ``Direct Administrative Expenses'' is revised by clarifying 
that they must be related to ``the financing and/or in support of 
Projects.'' The term ``Economic Development Activity'' is revised by 
deleting the term ``neighborhood based'' in order to allow expanded 
revitalization efforts that include and transcend neighborhood-based 
businesses; deleting ``which, In Conjunction with Affordable Housing 
Activities, implements,'' because the term ``In Conjunction with 
Affordable Housing'' is no longer a defined term in the revised interim 
rule; and clarifying that a CMF Award must be used to stabilize, 
sustain, or revitalize communities and neighborhoods physically 
proximate to any affordable housing to benefit a Low-Income Area or 
Underserved Rural Area. A new term, ``Economic Development Activity 
Fund'' is added to describe an investment fund consisting of the CMF 
Award and any Leveraged Capital that a Recipient manages and uses to 
finance Economic Development Activities. Specifically, a Recipient may 
use Economic Development Activity Fund for leveraging purposes by 
making any combination of debt, grant, or equity investment, but 
excludes the purchase of stock, securities, or the buy-out of 
partnership interests. The term ``Eligible-Income'' is revised by 
clarifying that for owner-occupied or rental Housing units, the 
qualifying annual income is at 120 percent or below of the AMI, 
adjusted for Family size, as determined by HUD. The term ``Eligible 
Project Costs'' is revised by deleting ``Leveraged Costs'' and deeming 
all development, financing, refinancing, acquisition, relocation, loan 
loss reserve, guarantee, predevelopment, and related soft costs 
incurred in achieving Project Completion as eligible, as described in 
the Assistance Agreement. These costs can be paid using a CMF Award and 
any Leveraged Capital. A new term ``Eligible Uses'' is defined and 
added. This term replaces

[[Page 53009]]

``Eligible Activities'' in Sec.  1807.301 of the 2016 interim rule and 
as applicable, in relevant parts of the revised interim rule, to align 
with the terminology used in the Act. The term ``Extremely Low-
Income&rdquo; is revised to clarify that for owner-occupied or rental 
Housing units, the qualifying annual income is at 30 percent or below 
of the AMI, adjusted for Family size, as determined by HUD. The term 
``Family'' is revised to include both single individuals and a group of 
individuals living in the same dwelling unit, who may be related by 
birth, marriage or adoption, or otherwise unrelated to each other in a 
household. A new term ``Feasibility Determination Expenses'' is added 
to create a mechanism by which a Recipient can allocate a portion of 
the CMF Award to support expenses disbursed to determine the 
feasibility of potential Affordable Housing Activities and/or Economic 
Development Activities. The Recipient must incur these expenses before 
Project Commitment. Such expenses may include preliminary market 
studies, engineering, architectural analyses, and financial feasibility 
analyses, which are explicitly excluded from Eligible Project Costs. A 
new term ``Homebuyer'' is added to describe a Family that may receive 
CMF assistance for Homeownership. This addition to the definitions is 
to ensure that Recipients do not use the CMF Awards to assist Families 
in buying second homes or multiple homes. The term ``Homeownership'' is 
revised to better align with the CMF program requirements by deleting 
the CDFI Fund's need to approve equivalent forms of ownership, because 
such approval is no longer a program requirement, and replacing it with 
a list of additional acceptable types of ownership, including 
cooperative, mutual housing, or ground lease title interest, as allowed 
under applicable State law; and deleting subsections (1)(i) through 
(iii) as they appear in the 2016 interim rule related to specific 
ground lease terms for Indian trust or restricted Indian lands, Housing 
located in Guam, the Northern Mariana Islands, the U.S. Virgin Island, 
and American Samoa, and manufactured housing. The 2016 interim rule 
specified terms for ground leases based on the location or type of 
housing. The CDFI Fund has decided that such specifications were overly 
prescriptive and not necessary for general program administration; 
instead, the revised interim rule requires compliance with appliable 
State law; redesignating (2) and (3) as (1) and (2), respectively, with 
no change to the content in (1); replacing ``restrictions on resale'' 
in redesignated (2) with ``restrictions on affordability,'' and 
deleting ``may only be'' and replacing it with ``is'' to take into 
account a possible application of affordability restrictions imposed by 
local homeownership programs. A new term ``Homeownership Program'' is 
added to codify the general waiver granted to select Recipients in the 
Fiscal Year 2018 NOFA, that allowed them to meet the CMF Commitment 
requirement for Homeownership, as long as the Recipients' Board of 
Directors established a homeownership program and committed the CMF 
Award to the program at the time of the Project Commitment. This newly 
defined term requires Recipients to establish a program to finance 
Purchase by meeting the requirements of Sec.  1807.501, in a form and 
substance acceptable to the CDFI Fund. The definition of ``Housing'' is 
streamlined to refer to Single-family and Multi-family residential 
units, such as manufactured housing, permanent supportive housing, 
single-room occupancy housing, assisted living and group homes that are 
permanent in nature and not temporary. The term, as revised, 
consolidates a list of supportive housing types--identified by specific 
population groups--under the single term ``permanent supportive 
housing'' in order to ensure that all eligible population groups are 
included in the definition; excludes manufactured housing lots as a 
type of housing, because CMF is not intended to finance dedicated lots 
or lands without associated Housing; adds assisted living as another 
eligible type of Housing; removes the reference to elder cottage 
housing opportunity (ECHO) because it is no longer eligible to be 
financed with the CMF Award; and clarifies that Housing financed with 
the CMF Award must be permanent in nature, which is consistent with 
similar clarifications made throughout the revised interim rule. The 
term ``In Conjunction With Affordable Housing'' is no longer a stand-
alone definition, but instead embedded in the definition of ``Economic 
Development Activities'' at Sec.  1807.403 in the revised interim rule. 
A new term ``Indian Tribe'' is added to define any Indian Tribe, 
pueblo, nation, or other organized group or community, including any 
Alaska Native village or regional or village corporation, as defined in 
or established pursuant to the Alaska Native Claims Settlement Act (43 
U.S.C. 1601 et seq.); each such Indian Tribe must be recognized as 
eligible for special programs and services provided by the United 
States to Indians because of their status as Indians. The term 
``Leveraged Costs'' is replaced with ``Leveraged Capital,'' and the 
definition is revised to reflect a type of capital used to finance and 
support Affordable Housing Activities and Economic Development 
Activities that exceed the dollar amount of the CMF Award, as further 
provided in Sec.  1807.500. The term ``Low-Income'' is revised to 
clarify that for owner-occupied or rental Housing units, the qualifying 
annual income is at 80 percent or below of the AMI, adjusted for Family 
size, as determined by HUD. The term ``Low-Income Area (or LIA)'' is 
revised by deleting a provision referring to block numbering, because 
it is not part of the geographic verification system. The term 
``Metropolitan Area'' is revised by adding at the end ``and as made 
available by the CDFI Fund for a specific Application funding round'' 
in order to make this definition consistent with the definition of 
``Non-Metropolitan Area,'' as it currently appears in the CMF program 
guidance. The term ``Multi-family'' is revised to delete ``townhouse'' 
from the definition, because a townhouse is a type of building that can 
be a Single-family housing, Multi-family housing, or mixed-use 
building. The term ``Nonprofit Organization'' is revised to include 
those organizations that are designated as a nonprofit or non-for-
profit entity under the laws of the organization's State or Indian 
Tribe of formation; exempt from Federal income taxation pursuant to 
Sec.  501(c)(3) of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986, with the 
exception of organizations affiliated with Indian Tribes; and able to 
demonstrate that a share of its total assets are dedicated to the 
development or management of affordable housing, as provided for in the 
NOFA. This change promotes consistency regarding the identification of 
entities within the scope of the definition and consistency with the 
statutory terminology, and provides additional clarity regarding the 
inclusion of Indian Tribes. Under the revised definition, a Nonprofit 
Organization may be an entity controlled by an instrumentality or 
subdivision of a state or local government. For transition purposes, 
the CDFI Fund is delaying the implementation of the new definition of 
``Nonprofit Organization'' until the first NOFA published on or after 
January 1, 2026. The term ``Participating Jurisdiction'' is no longer a 
defined term because it refers to a jurisdictional area that receives 
funding under the HOME program. Given that the revised interim rule 
incorporates the price limits set forth in HUD FHA Section 203(b)

[[Page 53010]]

Mortgage Insurance Program and discontinues the use of the limits used 
in the HOME program, the term ``Participating Jurisdiction'' is no 
longer applicable to the CMF. A new term ``Permanent Housing'' is added 
to distinguish it from temporary or transitory housing to reinforce 
that a CMF Award must be used to support Housing that is owned or 
rented under a written lease with an initial lease term of six months 
or longer. The term ``Preservation'' is revised by deleting all content 
in (1) through (5) as they appear in the 2016 interim rule and 
replacing it with new content. The definition as revised clarifies that 
in the case of owner-occupied Single-family housing or Multi-family 
rental housing with existing rent restrictions, any Preservation effort 
must extend the existing affordability restrictions that are set to 
expire within the Investment Period or set to expire at another time as 
defined by the CDFI Fund. The extension will be subject to the 
Affordability Period or as set forth in the Assistance Agreement. If 
the Housing does not have an existing affordability restriction, a new 
Affordability Period must be imposed subject to the aforementioned 
requirements. This minimizes the risk of an imminent loss of existing 
affordability restrictions for projects subject to preservation efforts 
using a CMF Award. It also proactively addresses the possible loss of 
affordable housing subject to affordability expiration pursuant to 
another Federal housing program. A new term ``Presumptively Compliant'' 
or ``Presumptive Compliance'' is added to describe a mechanism by which 
the CDFI Fund deems certain rules, requirements and designations under 
other comparable Federal housing programs to meet certain the CMF 
requirements. This change is being implemented to better align CMF with 
other Federal funding programs, to ease Recipients' administrative 
burden and reporting requirements, and to reflect strong support 
received from stakeholders in response to the RFI. The term ``Program 
Income'' is revised by adding ``and as further specified in the 
Recipient's Assistance Agreement'' to the existing definition, in order 
to allow the CDFI Fund to use another appropriate source to further 
clarify rules regarding Program Income; and replacing ``2 CFR part 
1000'' with ``2 CFR part 200'' to incorporate a more accurate 
regulatory citation. The term ``Project'' is revised to facilitate 
Recipients' understanding of the term used in the CMF program and to 
clarify that it refers to a specific Affordable Housing Activity, 
Economic Development Activity, or Homeownership Program the Recipient 
uses its CMF Award to finance or support, resulting in Project 
Completion. A new term ``Project Commitment'' is added to require the 
Recipient to provide, in written form and substance acceptable to the 
CDFI Fund, a commitment to a Project as set forth in Sec.  1807.501. 
The addition of this term complements the new Commitment process in 
Sec.  1807.501 and expands on the concept of ``Committed'' in the 2016 
interim rule. It also extends the time for Project Commitment. The term 
``Purchase'' is revised to describe the use of the CMF Award to provide 
financing to a Family for Homeownership that meets the qualifications 
set forth in subparts D and E of this part; or, in the case of using 
the CMF financing for an acquisition of rental Housing, to a developer 
or a project sponsor who also meets the qualifications set forth in 
subparts D and E of this part. This is to ensure that the CMF Awards 
are used for the Purchase of Affordable Housing to serve Families 
meeting these qualifications, or assist developers or project sponsors 
who, in turn, ultimately serve such Families. The term ``Revolving Loan 
Fund'' is revised to describe an investment fund consisting of the CMF 
Award and any Leveraged Capital that the Recipient manages and uses to 
finance and/or support Affordable Housing Activities and/or Economic 
Development Activities. The repayments on such loans are used to 
finance additional loans. The term ``Risk-Sharing Loan'' is revised to 
describe loans consisting of the CMF Award and any Leveraged Capital 
made for Affordable Housing Activities and/or Economic Development 
Activities whereby the risk of borrower default is shared by the 
Recipient with other lenders. A new term ``Rural Area'' is added to 
refer to a census tract that meets the definition of Rural Area, as 
defined in 12 CFR 1282.1. A new term ``Secondary Market Mortgage'' is 
added to create qualifications for the purchase of third-party 
originated mortgages using a CMF Award. This formalizes the policy 
guidance provided in the Fiscal Year 2023 NOFA that the Recipients' 
purchase of CMF eligible loans from a third-party originator within 12 
months of origination are an allowable activity under the CMF program. 
Specifically, the definition restricts the use of the CMF Award for the 
purchase of Secondary Market Mortgages to those mortgage(s) originated 
by third party lenders and purchased by Recipients within 12 months or 
less from the date of their origination as evidenced by an agreement; 
for which the source of origination is not the CMF Award; and that 
would not have been originated but for the Recipient's purchase. A new 
term ``Secondary Market Mortgage Purchase'' is added to describe a 
Recipient's purchase of a Secondary Market Mortgage to complement the 
definition of ``Secondary Market Mortgage.'' The term ``Service Area'' 
is revised by adding a national Service Area or other areas further 
defined by the CDFI Fund in the applicable NOFA, in order to expand the 
scope of the coverage. This allows Recipients to better serve certain 
geographic locations such as Rural Areas. The term ``Single-family 
housing'' is revised to include mutual housing, a manufactured housing 
unit only, or a combination of a manufactured housing unit and its lot. 
This ensures that the CMF funded financing requires an affordable 
housing unit and prohibits the financing of a manufactured housing lot 
only. The term ``State'' is revised to streamline the definition and 
accommodate any United States government changes to its territories by 
deleting the current list of United States territories ``the 
Commonwealth of Puerto Rico, the Commonwealth of the Northern Mariana 
Island, Guam, the U.S. Virgin Islands, American Samoa, the Trust 
Territory of the Pacific Islands'' from the definition. All United 
States territories, Districts and Commonwealths remain as eligible 
geographies. The term ``Subsidiary'' is revised to refer to an entity 
that is majority-owned by its parent company. This clarification is to 
make a clear distinction between the definitions of Affiliates and 
Subsidiaries. The term ``Underserved Rural Area'' is revised because it 
needs to be consistent with the definition of ``Rural Area,'' which is 
a new term in the revised interim rule. The term &ldquo;Uniform 
Administrative Requirements'' is revised by replacing ``2 CFR part 
1000'' with ``2 CFR part 200'' to incorporate a more accurate 
regulatory citation. The term ``Very Low-Income'' is revised by 
clarifying that for owner-occupied or rental Housing units, the 
qualifying annual income is at 60 percent or below of the AMI, adjusted 
for Family size, as determined by HUD.
    Section 1807.105 is revised by replacing the term ``would'' with 
``would not'' to clarify that for individual waivers, the CDFI Fund 
will determine that the application of the requirement to be waived 
does not adversely affect achieving the purpose

[[Page 53011]]

of the Act. Section 1807.106 is redesignated as ``Presumptive 
Compliance with Other Federal Programs,'' and the entire content 
removed and replaced with new CMF requirements related to Presumptive 
Compliance. Section 1807.107 is revised by deleting the reference to 
the prior publication of the interim rule ``February 8, 2016,'' 
clarifying the applicability of the interim rule to all future uses of 
prior CMF Awards and all future CMF Awards granted under any NOFA 
published after the publication date of this revised interim rule, and 
specifying when the new definition of ``Nonprofit Organization'' will 
take effect to facilitate the transition to the new definition.
Subpart B--Eligibility
    Section 1807.200(a)(2)(iii) is revised by replacing ``[c]an 
demonstrate that'' with ``[d]emonstrates'' as an editorial change, and 
by adding relevant CMF program documents at the end of the sentence for 
clarification. Section 1807.200(b) is revised by clarifying that for an 
Applicant seeking eligibility under Sec.  1807.200(a)(1), the CDFI will 
verify that the Applicant is a Certified CDFI pursuant to the guidance 
provided in the applicable NOFA.
Subpart C--Eligible Purposes; Eligible Uses: Restrictions
    Section 1807.300(b) includes an updated definition for ``Economic 
Development Activities,'' as further described in Sec.  1807.403, that 
they must be located in a Low-Income Area or Underserved Rural Area; 
undertaken in conjunction with any affordable housing that is 
authorized as such under applicable local, State or Federal housing 
program laws; and reasonably available, physically proximate to, and 
benefit residents of such affordable housing. Sections 1807.300(b)(1) 
through (3) in the 2016 interim rule are deleted and some of the 
concepts contained therein are reorganized in Sec.  1807.403 as new 
content.
    Section 1807.301 is redesignated as ``Eligible Uses,'' and Sec.  
1807.301(d) is revised to incorporate the newly defined term ``Economic 
Development Activity Fund.''
    Section 1807.302(a)(12) is revised by replacing ``student 
dormitories'' with ``dormitories'' to clarify that CMF Awards cannot be 
used to fund any types of dormitories, not just student dormitories. 
Section 1807.302(b)(1) is revised by adding to the list of businesses 
deemed ineligible to receive financing and/or support with a CMF Award 
those businesses or activities provided in 13 CFR 120.110(c) through 
(p), and other businesses deemed inconsistent with the general purpose 
of the Riegle Community Development and Regulatory Improvement Act of 
1994 (12 U.S.C. 4701 et seq.; Pub. L. 103-325). Section 1807.302(c) is 
revised to state that the restriction on the use of Economic 
Development Activities to no more than 30 percent of their CMF Awards 
must be approved in the applicable Assistance Agreement. Section 
1807.302(d) is revised to clarify that any Affordable Housing financed 
and/or supported by Loan Guarantee or Loan Loss Reserves shall be 
tracked during the Affordability Period for compliance with the 
affordability requirements, as provided in subpart D of this part. 
Section 1807.302(e) is revised by clarifying that repayment of loans 
made pursuant to Loan Guarantees or Loan Loss Reserves during the 
Investment Period must be used as Program Income, subject to the 
requirements in the Recipient's Assistance Agreement. Section 
1807.302(f) is revised to allow Recipients to use the CMF Award for 
Direct Administrative Expenses or Feasibility Determination Expenses at 
amounts set forth in the applicable NOFA and corresponding Assistance 
Agreement. This change provides additional flexibility on the use of 
the CMF Award when Recipients are assessing a project's feasibility as 
part of their preliminary analysis prior to Project Commitment. The 
expanded guidance further provides that neither Feasibility 
Determination Expenses nor Direct Administrative Expenses may be deemed 
as Eligible Project Costs.
    Section 1807.303(a) is revised by deleting ``for the approved, 
eligible CMF Award uses'' and replacing it with ``in the manner as 
further set forth in the Assistance Agreement,'' because terms on the 
use of Program Income will be provided in the Assistance Agreement. 
Section 1807.303(b) is revised by replacing ``2 CFR part 1000'' with 
``2 CFR part 200'' to incorporate a more accurate regulatory citation.
Subpart D--Qualifications as Affordable Housing
    Section 1807.400 is restructured with the newly designated 
subsections 1807.400(a), (b) and (c) and revised with new requirements 
by maintaining the current guidance on the use of a CMF Award for 
Affordable Housing Activities, including compliance with affordability 
qualifications set forth in the applicable NOFA and/or Assistance 
Agreement; setting forth new requirements based on the new definition 
of Permanent Housing in the revised interim rule; and establishing that 
none of the residents of Affordable Housing can be full-time students, 
unless they are married filing a joint tax return, receive assistance 
under Title IV of the Social Security Act, enrolled in a job training 
program, are with dependent children as single parents, as defined in 
IRC sec. 152, previously enrolled in a foster care program, or meet 
other criteria specified by the CDFI Fund.
    The introductory paragraph to Sec.  1807.401 is revised by 
clarifying that rental Multi-family housing Projects financed and/or 
supported with a CMF Award must have at least 20 percent of the units 
rent-restricted to any combination of Low-Income, Very Low-Income, or 
Extremely Low-Income Families with specific income levels and meet the 
rent limits provided for in the applicable NOFA and Assistance 
Agreement in any CMF funding round. Section 1807.401(a) is revised by 
deleting all of the content that describes the calculation of CMF 
rental units according to a tenant's income category and replacing it 
with ``[t]he gross rent limits for Affordable Housing are further 
specified in the Assistance Agreement.'' There are no changes to the 
content in Sec.  1807.401(b). Section 1807.401(c) is revised to clarify 
that the gross rent restrictions are set forth in the Assistance 
Agreement and under IRC sec. 42(g)(2), as applicable. Section 
1807.401(d) is revised to clarify that Housing under this section must 
meet the affordability requirement during the Affordability Period. 
Moreover, the affordability restrictions are allowed to terminate upon 
foreclosure of the Housing or transfer in lieu of foreclosure. The 
affordability requirements must be imposed by deed restrictions, 
covenants running with the land, or other recording instruments. A 
Recipient may use other types of recording instruments, as further set 
forth in the Assistance Agreement, if written approval is obtained from 
the CDFI Fund. To the extent allowed under State law, proceeds used to 
pay off mortgages financed with a CMF Award in the event of a sale of a 
property at a foreclosure sale, transfer in lieu of foreclosure, short 
sale, or other types of disposition, will be treated as Program Income 
to allow Recipients to engage in additional Affordable Housing 
Activities and/or Eligible Uses, except to capitalize an Economic 
Development Activity Fund, in Sec.  1807.301. Section 1807.401(e) is 
re-titled as ``Standard Lease Terms and Conditions,'' and the entire 
content removed and replaced to prescribe that a written lease or 
rental agreement, which must be in

[[Page 53012]]

compliance with applicable State or local law, is required for all 
tenants occupying rental CMF Units. Section 1807.401(f)(1) is revised 
to clarify that at the time of each initial lease and occupancy, the 
tenant income will be determined to ascertain income eligibility. 
During the Affordability Period, the existing tenant's income will be 
re-examined annually based on requirements set forth in the Assistance 
Agreement. In addition, ``household'' is replaced with ``Family'' to 
incorporate the new term and ``assisted'' with ``supported'' for 
clarity as an editorial change. Section 1807.401(f)(3) is deleted, as 
it is no longer applicable based on the current HOME regulation in 
effect. Section 1807.401(f)(4) in the 2016 interim rule is redesignated 
as Sec.  1807.401(f)(3) and is revised by replacing the term ``Low-
Income Family'' with ``Family'' to expand the scope of applicable 
Families for the CMF. Section 1807.401(g)(1) is revised to incorporate 
the new term ``CMF Unit.'' Section 1807.401(g)(2) is revised by 
deleting references to IRC sec. 42(g) and 42(h) to the extent that the 
CDFI Fund has not and is not fully adopting the requirements set forth 
therein in the revised interim rule, as the rent limitation 
determination and calculation will be provided for in the Assistance 
Agreement. Moreover, this section incorporates editorial changes to 
clarify that the maximum rent for tenants whose incomes no longer 
qualify is either 30 percent of the Family's annual income, or the 
amount payable by the tenants under State or local law, whichever is 
less. Section 1807.401(g)(3) is revised to incorporate the new term 
``CMF Unit'' in lieu of ``CMF financed or assisted unit'' and clarifies 
that if the income of a tenant of a CMF Unit no longer qualifies, the 
Recipient may designate another unit as a rent-restricted replacement 
unit, as long as it meets the affordability qualification for the same 
income category as the original unit within the same Project. A new 
term ``Homebuyer'' is being incorporated throughout Sec.  1807.402 to 
prohibit Recipients from using the CMF Awards to assist Families in 
buying second homes or multiple homes. Section 1807.402 is restructured 
as follows: Sec.  1807.402(a) in the 2016 interim rule is redesignated 
as Sec.  1807.402(a)(1); Sec.  1807.402(a)(1) is redesignated as Sec.  
1807.402(a)(1)(i) with a new subheading ``Single-family housing''; 
Sec.  1807.402(a)(2) is redesignated as Sec.  1807.402(a)(1)(ii) with a 
new subheading ``Purchase price limits''; Sec.  1807.402(a)(3) is 
redesignated as Sec. &thnsp;1807.402(a)(1)(iii) with a new subheading 
``Qualifying Homebuyer''; a new Sec.  1807.402(a)(1)(iv) is added with 
new content under subheading ``Eligible-Income requirements''; Sec.  
1807.402(a)(4) is redesignated as Sec.  1807.402(a)(1)(v); and Sec.  
1807.402(a)(5) is redesignated as Sec.  1807.402(a)(1)(vi)(A) and (B). 
The redesignated Sec.  1807.402(a)(1) is revised by clarifying that a 
Recipient that uses the CMF Award to finance or support the Purchase of 
Housing by a qualified Homebuyer must ensure that the Housing and 
Homebuyer meet the affordability requirements in subpart D of this 
part. The redesignated Sec.  1807.402(a)(1)(ii) is revised by replacing 
the Single-family housing purchase price limits of ``95 percent of the 
median purchase price for the area as used in the HOME Program'' with 
the purchase price limits for the area under the HUD FHA Section 203(b) 
Mortgage Insurance Program, or any other index as designated by the 
CDFI Fund. This revision is necessary because the index used in the 
2016 interim rule has lagged market conditions, resulting in limited 
availability of housing choices for Families, particularly large 
Families, and may have had the unintended effect of concentrating 
affordable housing to certain geographic areas and communities, 
possibly in conflict with the CMF objectives. This section further 
requires that the underlying mortgage be originated based on an 
assessment of whether the borrower can repay the loan based on terms 
and conditions that are transparent and understandable, and the 
affordability of the mortgage to the Homebuyer over the life of the 
loan. The redesignated Sec.  1807.402(a)(1)(iii) is revised by 
replacing ``Family'' with ``Homebuyer'' to incorporate the new term for 
accuracy; a similar requirement that ``the Single-family housing must 
be the principal residence of the Family throughout the period 
described in paragraph (a)(4) of this section'' is now included in 
Sec.  1807.402(a)(1)(v). The new Sec.  1807.402(a)(1)(iv) establishes 
that a qualifying Homebuyer under this section must have a household 
income at Eligible-Income; to determine whether a Family would be 
income-eligible under this section, adjusted gross income as defined 
under Internal Revenue Service (IRS) Form 1040 series for individual 
Federal annual income tax reporting is used, or other methodology for 
determining income eligibility as provided in the Assistance Agreement; 
and a homeowners of one- to four-unit Single-family housing may rent 
the additional unit(s) as Permanent Housing if at least one unit is 
maintained as the principal residence of the Homebuyer. This last 
requirement is being added to encourage an increase in the overall 
number of rental units to help boost the supply of rental housing and 
address an unprecedented housing crisis nationwide. The redesignated 
Sec.  1807.402(a)(1)(v) is revised by adding the requirement that the 
Single-family housing must be the principal residence of the Homebuyer 
at the time of Purchase and is subject to the affordability 
requirements during the Affordability Period as provided in 
redesignated Sec.  1807.402(a)(1)(vi) to ensure the CMF Award is being 
used to serve the intended income qualified Homebuyer. It further 
explains that the Affordability Period does not apply to additional 
units of the Single-family housing being rented as Permanent Housing. 
The redesignated Sec.  1807.402(a)(1)(vi) is revised to state that the 
Recipient must establish and impose recoupment, replacement and resale 
strategies requiring that under new Sec.  1807.402(a)(1)(vi)(A), if the 
Housing is sold in five years or less from the date of Purchase, the 
Housing must be sold in a manner that meets the qualifications set 
forth in Sec.  1807.402, or the CMF Award will be recouped and the 
Housing replaced with a replacement unit to satisfy the affordability 
requirement for the remainder of the Affordability Period. Under new 
Sec.  1807.402(a)(1)(vi)(B), if the Housing is sold any time after five 
years from the date of Purchase but before the end of the Affordability 
Period, the Housing must be sold to a new Eligible-Income Family or, if 
the Housing is not sold to an Eligible-Income Family, a proportionate 
share of the CMF investment must be recouped as Program Income. In case 
the Housing is not sold to an Eligible-Income Family after five years 
from the date of Purchase and the Recipient recoups a proportional 
amount of the CMF Awards as Program Income, the Recipient is not 
required to replace the sold Housing with another replacement unit. 
Additionally, a Recipient's recoupment, replacement, and resale 
strategy must meet the requirements of newly designated Sec.  
1807.402(a)(1)(vi) for compliance with program requirements and the 
terms under the Assistance Agreement. The affordability requirements 
are allowed to terminate at the time of foreclosure, transfer in lieu 
of foreclosure, or assignment of an FHA-insured mortgage to HUD. The 
occurrence of these events will result in the Housing no longer being 
subject to an affordability requirement or a recoupment, replacement, 
or resale strategy previously imposed by the

[[Page 53013]]

Recipient. The affordability restrictions shall be revised according to 
the original terms, however, if during the original Affordability 
Period, the owner of record before the termination event obtains an 
ownership interest in the Housing. Section 1807.402(b)(1) is revised by 
replacing the Single-family housing purchase price limits as used in 
the HOME Program with those used in the HUD FHA Section 203(b) Mortgage 
Insurance Program, identical to the change made to Sec.  
1807.402(a)(1)(ii). Section 1807.402(b)(2) is revised to reinforce that 
the Single-family housing must remain the principal residence of the 
Family throughout the Affordability Period, as described in Sec.  
1807.402(b)(3). Section 1807.402(b)(3) is revised by replacing ``at 
least 10 years'' with ``Affordability Period'' to incorporate the new 
term, and ``after Rehabilitation is completed'' with ``upon Project 
Completion or meet recoupment, replacement, and/or resale'' to 
accurately describe the program requirement in Sec.  1807.402(a)(1)(vi) 
as referenced herein. A new Sec.  1807.402(b)(4) is added to describe 
the allowable uses of permanent additional units as described in the 
definition of ``Housing'' for a Homebuyer owning Single-family housing 
subject to the requirements under this part. Section 1807.402(c) is 
revised to reinforce that any owner of Single-family housing under this 
section must meet the definition of ``Homebuyer.'' Section 1807.402(e) 
is revised to clarify that when converting rental CMF Units to 
Homeownership units by selling, donating, or otherwise conveying the 
units to existing tenants, the tenants can only become Homebuyers under 
an existing documented rent-to-own program pursuant to the requirements 
under this section. The Homeownership units are also subject to a 
minimum period of affordability equal to the remaining rental 
Affordability Period, as further specified in the Assistance Agreement.
    A newly added Sec.  1807.403 comprises CMF program requirements 
regarding Economic Development Activities and is now consolidated under 
a single section. The 2016 interim rule requirement, located in Sec.  
1807.302(c), that no more than 30 percent of a CMF Award for each 
individual CMF Award round, may be used for Economic Development 
Activities, is repeated in the introductory paragraph of Sec.  
1807.403. The introductory paragraph to Sec.  1807.403 also provides 
that a CMF Award used for Economic Development Activities must 
stabilize, sustain, or revitalize communities and neighborhoods 
physically proximate to any affordable housing to meet the requirements 
outlined in this section.
    Section 1807.403(a) describes the Eligible Uses of a CMF Award to 
finance and support Economic Development Activities pursuant to Sec.  
1807.301, with the exception of Affordable Housing Fund. This revision 
extends all Eligible Uses for Economic Development Activities, which 
was not previously articulated in the 2016 interim rule. Section 
1807.403(b) provides a new requirement that Recipients who use their 
CMF Awards for allowable Economic Development Activities resulting in 
real estate and/or physical structures must ensure such are used for a 
minimum of three years commencing with Project Completion. This 
requirement establishes a new compliance requirement, which is absent 
in the 2016 interim rule, that physical structures resulting from 
Economic Development Activities retain the intended or similar purpose 
for at least three years from Project Completion. Section 1807.403(c) 
restates the definitional requirement that the Economic Development 
Activities must be undertaken as part of a Concerted Strategy which, 
for example, will result in increased education, employment, 
transportation, financial services or other opportunities in a Low-
Income Area or Underserved Rural Area. Section 1807.403(d) incorporates 
the requirements related to the term ``In Conjunction with Affordable 
Housing'' which appears in the 2016 interim rule. This section 
establishes that Economic Development Activities must be located in a 
Low-Income Area or Underserved Rural Area; undertaken in conjunction 
with any affordable housing that is subject to or authorized by local, 
State or Federal laws; and reasonably available, physically proximate, 
and benefit residents of such affordable housing. This section also 
establishes criteria for physical proximity for Metropolitan and Non-
Metropolitan Areas, which are existing provisions in the 2016 interim 
rule being reorganized under this section for ease of reference.
Subpart E--Leveraged Capital; Eligible Project Costs; Commitment 
Requirements
    Section 1807.500(a) is revised under a new subheading ``Eligible 
Project Costs'' to clarify that the leverage requirement to generate 
Eligible Project Costs in an amount at least 10 times the CMF Award 
excludes any Direct Administrative Expenses and Feasibility 
Determination Costs, combined, from the calculation. This is to allow 
Recipients additional flexibility in the use of the CMF Award in 
determining whether to proceed with prospective projects prior to 
Project Commitment. In Sec.  1807.500(b)(1), ``percentage'' is replaced 
with ``multiplier'' to reflect the update to the term ``Leveraged 
Capital,'' and ``private'' is added before ``non-government sources'' 
for clarity. Sections 1807.500(b)(2)(ii) through (iii) are revised to 
reinforce that Leveraged Capital used to finance and/or support 
Affordable Housing Activities or Economic Development Activities must 
comply with Sec. Sec.  1807.400, 1807.401 and 1807.402 or Sec.  
1807.403 in subpart D, respectively, and as further provided in the 
Assistance Agreement. Section 1807.500(c) is deleted in its entirety; 
any related requirements will be described in the Assistance Agreement.
    Section 1807.501, re-titled as ``Commitments,'' establishes a new 
Commitment process to better align with the requirements under the Act. 
This section also adds new content at Sec. Sec.  1807.501(c)(4) through 
(6) to expand the requirements to determine Project Commitment. To 
afford Recipients additional time and flexibility in identifying 
projects to further CMF objectives, Sec.  1807.501(a) is revised to 
establish that pursuant to Sec.  1807.301, the use of a CMF Award must 
be Committed for Use by Recipients to one or more Eligible Uses within 
two years of the date designated in the Recipient's Assistance 
Agreement. The content in Sec. Sec.  1807.501(b)(1) through (3) is 
deleted in its entirety and the new content in Sec.  1807.501(b) 
provides that the Recipient must achieve Project Commitment within 
three years of the date designated in the Recipient's Assistance 
Agreement, resulting in a longer timeframe to identify viable projects. 
The content in Sec.  1807.501(c) is deleted in its entirety and new 
content in the newly designated Sec. Sec.  1807.501(c)(1) through (3) 
describes the Commitment requirements for real estate projects, and 
replaces ``commitment'' with ``Project Commitment,'' a newly defined 
term in the revised interim rule. The newly designated Sec. Sec.  
1807.501(c)(4) through (6) set forth the following new, expanded 
Commitment requirements: For Secondary Market Mortgage Purchase, the 
Recipient must evidence an agreement with a third party lender to 
purchase the qualified mortgages and demonstrate that such mortgages 
would not have been otherwise originated by the third party lender; for 
a qualified Homeownership Program, the Recipient must evidence that a 
commitment has been made by the action of the

[[Page 53014]]

Recipient's Board or Directors; and for a Project comprised of a Loan 
Guarantee or Loan Loss Reserves, the Recipient must enter into a 
guarantee agreement or have established a cash reserve, escrow, or 
accounting-based accrual reserve with a lender or investor. These 
revisions are a recognition of the breadth of CMF activities and 
differing criteria in meeting Project Commitment. Section 1807.501(c) 
is deleted in its entirety due to redundancy, as similar content 
appears in Sec.  1807.901 and in the NOFA. Section 1807.501(d) is 
deleted in its entirety, as this content is set forth in the NOFA and/
or Assistance Agreement.
    Section 1807.503(a) is revised by adding ``for Affordable Housing 
Activities and Economic Development Activities'' after ``Project 
Completion'' to fully capture the Project Completion requirements for 
all types of CMF activities. Section 1807.503(a)(4) is revised by 
clarifying that for Preservation, Project Completion occurs when the 
refinancing of the loan is closed and the underlying real estate is 
compliant with all CMF requirements, subject to any additional program 
requirements for Rehabilitation as applicable. Section 1807.503(a) adds 
new content at Sec. Sec.  1807.503(a)(5) through (7) in the revised 
interim rule to expand the Project Completion requirements to include 
Secondary Market Mortgage Purchase, Loan Loss Reserve and Loan 
Guarantee activities. Section 1807.503(b) is revised by deleting 
``which must be met for a period of at least 10 years after the Project 
Completion date'' with respect to property standards based on the new 
definition of ``Affordability Period,'' which could be extended to more 
than 10 years. Section 1807.503(b)(1) is revised by adding a subheading 
``Code requirements.'' Section 1807.501(b)(2) is revised by adding a 
subheading ``Other requirements.'' Section 1807.503(b)(2)(i) is revised 
by adding ``Title VIII of the Civil Rights Act of 1968'' before ``Fair 
Housing Act'' for clarity and making editorial changes to clarify that 
``Multi-family housing'' as used in this section is equivalent to 
``covered multifamily dwellings,'' as defined in 24 CFR 100.201.
    Section 1807.503(b)(3)(i) is revised by replacing ``10-year period 
of affordability'' with ``Affordability Period'' to incorporate the new 
term.
Subpart F--Tracking Funds; Uniform Administrative Requirements; Nature 
of Funds
    Section 1807.602 is revised by deleting ``CMF Award proceeds retain 
their Federal character until the end of the Investment Period'' as 
this or similar requirement will be set forth in the Assistance 
Agreement and/or other CDFI Fund guidance.
Subpart H--Evaluation and Section of Applications
    Section 1807.800(a) is revised by deleting ``on a merit based and'' 
and adding ``based on the criteria outlined in the NOFA'' as an 
editorial change for clarity.
    Section 1807.801(b) is revised by deleting Sec. Sec.  
1807.801(b)(1) through (b)(4) in their entireties for redundancy, as 
they are included in other CDFI Fund guidance materials. Section 
1807.801(c) is revised by designating this subsection as ``Other 
Factors'' with no change to content.
Subpart I--Terms and Conditions of CMF Award
    Section 1807.900(a)(2) is revised by replacing ``uses'' with 
``Eligible Uses'' for clarity. Section 1807.900(c) is revised to 
clarify that the CDFI Fund will provide a Recipient with reasonable 
notice and opportunity to cure any instances of noncompliance prior to 
determining whether the Recipient has failed to comply substantially 
with the Act, these regulations or an Assistance Agreement.
    Section 1807.902(b) is redesignated as ``Beneficiary Demographic 
Data'' for clarity and revised by deleting ``must'' and replacing it 
with ``may be required to'' to reflect a change in the program 
requirements.
    Section 1807.902(d) is revised by adding ``and the applicable 
NOFA'' at the end for clarity.
    Section 1807.902(e)(iii) is revised by updating financial reporting 
criteria for regulated financial institutions (i.e., Insured Depository 
Institutions, Depository Institution Holding Companies, and Insured 
Credit Unions) to align with the CDFI Fund compliance requirements with 
respect to completing a Financial Statement Audit report.
    Section 1807.902(f) is deleted in its entirety as the requirement 
is included in the applicable NOFA and/or the Assistance Agreement.

V. Rulemaking Analysis

A. Executive Order (E.O.) 12866

    It has been determined that this interim rule is not a significant 
regulatory action under Executive Order 12866, as amended. Accordingly, 
a regulatory impact assessment is not required.

B. Regulatory Flexibility Act

    Because no notice of proposed rulemaking is required under the 
Administrative Procedure Act (5 U.S.C. 553), or any other law, the 
Regulatory Flexibility Act does not apply.

C. Paperwork Reduction Act

    The collections of information contained in this interim rule will 
be reviewed and approved by the Office of Management and Budget (OMB) 
in accordance with the Paperwork Reduction Act of 1995 and assigned the 
applicable, approved OMB Control Numbers associated with the CDFI Fund 
under 1559-XXXX. An agency may not conduct or sponsor, and a person is 
not required to respond to, a collection of information unless it 
displays a valid control number assigned by OMB. This document restates 
the collections of information without substantive change.

D. National Environmental Policy Act

    This interim rule has been reviewed in accordance with the CDFI 
Fund's environmental quality regulations (12 CFR part 1815), 
promulgated pursuant to the National Environmental Protection Act of 
1969 (NEPA), which requires that the CDFI Fund adequately consider the 
cumulative impact proposed activities have upon the human environment. 
It is the determination of the CDFI Fund that the interim rule does not 
constitute a major Federal action significantly affecting the quality 
of the human environment and, in accordance with the NEPA and the CDFI 
Fund's environmental quality regulations (12 CFR part 1815), neither an 
Environmental Assessment nor an Environmental Impact Statement is 
required.

E. Administrative Procedure Act

    Because the revisions to this revised interim rule relate to loans 
and grants, notice and public procedure and a delayed effective date 
are not required pursuant to the Administrative Procedure Act, 5 U.S.C. 
553(a)(2).

F. Comment

    Public comment is solicited on all aspects of this revised interim 
rule. The CDFI Fund will consider all comments made on the substance of 
this revised interim rule, but it does not intend to hold hearings.

Sec.  1807.400   Affordable Housing--General.

    (a) For any amount of the CMF Award used for Affordable Housing 
Activities, 100 percent of such Eligible Project Costs must be 
attributable to Affordable Housing, meaning that the Affordable Housing 
complies with the affordability qualifications set forth in this 
subpart for Eligible-Income Families. Further, as a subset of said 100 
percent, greater than 50 percent of the Eligible Project Costs must be 
attributable to Affordable Housing that comply with the affordability 
qualifications set forth in this subpart for Low-Income, Very Low-
Income, or Extremely Low-Income Families, or as further set forth in 
the applicable NOFA and/or Assistance Agreement.
    (b) Affordable Housing must be Permanent Housing.
    (c) All the occupants of the Affordable Housing must not be full-
time students unless they are:

Sec.  1807.401   Affordable Housing--Rental Housing.

    To qualify as Affordable Housing, each rental Multi-family housing 
Project financed with a CMF Award must have at least 20 percent of the 
units rent-restricted to any combination of Low-Income, Very Low-
Income, or Extremely Low-Income Families and must comply with the rent 
limits as set forth in the applicable NOFA and Assistance Agreement in 
any CMF funding round. The CDFI Fund may require a greater percentage 
of the units per Project to be income-targeted and/or require a 
specific targeted income commitment in any given CMF round, as set 
forth in the applicable NOFA and Assistance Agreement.
    (a) Rent limitations. The gross rent limits for Affordable Housing 
are further specified in the Assistance Agreement.
    (b) Nondiscrimination against rental assistance subsidy holders. 
The Recipient shall require that the owner of a rental unit cannot 
refuse to lease the unit to a Section 8 Program certificate or voucher 
holder (24 CFR part 982, Section 8 Tenant-Based Assistance: Unified 
Rule for Tenant-Based Assistance under the Section 8 Rental Certificate 
Program and the Section 8 Rental Voucher Program) or to the holder of a 
comparable document evidencing participation in a HOME tenant-based 
rental assistance program because of the status of the prospective 
tenant as a holder of such certificate, voucher, or comparable HOME 
tenant-based assistance document.
    (c) Initial rent schedule and utility allowances. The Recipient 
shall ensure that utility allowances and submetering rules are 
consistent with regulations concerning utility allowances and 
submetering in buildings that are subject to gross rent restrictions as 
set forth in the Assistance Agreement and under IRC sec. 42(g)(2), as 
applicable.
    (d) Periods of affordability. Housing under this section must meet 
the affordability requirements during the Affordability Period. The 
affordability requirements apply without regard to the term of any loan 
or mortgage or the transfer of ownership and must be imposed by deed 
restrictions, covenants running with the land, or other recording 
instruments. Upon receipt of a written approval from the CDFI Fund, a 
Recipient may use a different recording instrument as provided for in 
the Assistance Agreement. The affordability restrictions are allowed to 
terminate upon foreclosure or transfer in lieu of foreclosure. To the 
extent allowed under State law, in the event of a sale of property at 
foreclosure, transfer in lieu of foreclosure, short sale or other types 
of disposition, proceeds available to pay off a mortgage financed with 
a CMF Award shall be treated as Program Income.
    (e) Standard lease terms and conditions. All tenants occupying 
rental CMF Units shall be required to enter into a written lease or 
rental agreement setting forth the terms and requirements which are, 
but not limited to, compliance with applicable State and local law.
    (f) Tenant income determination. (1) At the time of each initial 
lease and occupancy, the tenant income shall be determined to ascertain 
income eligibility. During the Affordability Period, the existing 
tenant income shall be re-examined in a manner as set forth in the 
Assistance Agreement. Tenant income examination and verification are 
ultimately the responsibility of the Recipient. Tenant income shall 
include income from all Family members. The Recipient must require the 
Project owner to obtain information on rents and occupancy of 
Affordable Housing financed or supported with a CMF Award in order to 
demonstrate compliance with this section.
    (2) One of the following two definitions of ``annual income'' must 
be used to determine whether a Family is income-eligible:
    (i) Adjusted gross income as defined for purposes of reporting 
under Internal Revenue Service (IRS) Form 1040 series for individual 
Federal annual income tax purposes; or
    (ii) Annual Income as defined at 24 CFR 5.609 (except that when 
determining the income of a homeowner for an owner-occupied 
Rehabilitation Project, the value of the homeowner's principal 
residence may be excluded from the calculation of ``Net Family 
Assets,'' as defined in 24 CFR 5.603).
    (3) The CDFI Fund reserves the right to deem certain government 
programs, under which a Family is a recipient, as income eligible for 
purposes of meeting the tenant income requirements under this section.
    (g) Over-income tenants. (1) CMF Units continue to qualify as 
Affordable Housing despite a temporary noncompliance caused by 
increases in the incomes of existing tenants if actions satisfactory to 
the CDFI Fund are being taken to ensure that all vacancies are filled 
in accordance with this section until the noncompliance is corrected.
    (2) The maximum rent for tenants whose incomes no longer qualify is 
either 30 percent of the Family's annual income, or the amount payable 
by the tenants under State or local law, whichever is less; however, 
tenants whose income exceeds the Eligible-Income level are not required 
to pay rent in excess of the market rent for comparable, unassisted 
units in the neighborhood.
    (3) If the income of a tenant of a CMF Unit no longer qualifies, 
the Recipient may designate another unit within the Project as a rent-
restricted replacement unit that meets the affordability

[[Page 53021]]

qualifications for the same income category as the original unit, as 
further set forth in the Recipient's Assistance Agreement. If there is 
not an available replacement unit, the Recipient must fill the first 
available vacancy with a tenant that meets the affordability 
qualifications for the same income category of the original unit as 
necessary to maintain compliance with the CMF requirements and the 
Assistance Agreement.


Sec.  1807.402   Affordable Housing--Homeownership.

    (a) Purchase with or without Rehabilitation. (1) A Recipient that 
uses the CMF Award to finance or support the Purchase of Housing by a 
qualified Homebuyer must ensure that the Housing and Homebuyer meet the 
affordability requirements of this subpart as follows:
    (i) Single-family housing. The Housing must be a Single-family 
housing.
    (ii) Purchase price limits. The Single-family housing does not 
exceed the purchase price limits for the area under the HUD FHA Section 
203(b) Mortgage Insurance Program, or any other index designated by the 
CDFI Fund as set forth in the applicable Assistance Agreement; the 
related mortgage must be originated based upon an assessment of whether 
the Homebuyer can repay the loan based on terms and conditions that are 
transparent and understandable to the Homebuyer, and the mortgage is 
affordable to the Homebuyer over the life of the loan.
    (iii) Qualifying Homebuyer. The Single-family housing must be 
purchased by a qualifying Homebuyer.
    (iv) Eligible-Income requirements. A qualifying Homebuyer must have 
a household income at no greater than Eligible-Income. To determine 
whether a Homebuyer qualifies as Eligible Income (or at any other 
income level specified in the Assistance Agreement) under this section, 
the Recipient must use the Homebuyer's adjusted gross income as defined 
under Internal Revenue Service (IRS) Form 1040 series for individual 
Federal annual income tax reporting purposes, or other methodology for 
determining income eligibility as provided in the Assistance Agreement. 
Homebuyers of one- to four- unit Single-family housing may rent the 
additional unit(s) as Permanent Housing if at least one unit is 
maintained as the principal residence of the Homebuyer.
    (v) Periods of affordability. Single-family housing under this 
section must become the principal residence of the Homebuyer at the 
time of Purchase and is subject to the affordability requirements 
during the Affordability Period and as further set forth in Sec.  
1807.402(a)(1)(vi). The Affordability Period does not apply to 
additional units rented as Permanent Housing, as described in Sec.  
1807.402(a)(1)(iv).
    (vi) Resale. To ensure that the CMF Awards are being used for 
qualifying Families during the Affordability Period, recoupment, 
replacement, and/or resale strategies must be established and imposed 
by the Recipient. A recoupment, replacement, and/or resale strategy 
must ensure that:
    (A) In the event the qualifying Family sells the Housing in five 
years or less from the date of Purchase, the Housing must be sold to an 
Eligible-Income Family meeting the qualifications set forth in Sec.  
1807.402. Otherwise, the CMF Award investment must be recouped by the 
Recipient and the Housing replaced with a replacement unit to satisfy 
the affordability requirement for the remainder of the Affordability 
Period. If the Housing is replaced, the replacement unit must be sold 
to an Eligible-Income Family and must also meet the qualifications set 
forth in Sec.  1807.402.
    (B) In the event the qualifying Family sells the Housing any time 
after five years from the date of Purchase but before the end of the 
Affordability Period, the Housing must either be sold to a new 
Eligible-Income Family or, if the Housing is not sold to an Eligible-
Income Family, the CMF investment must be recouped as Program Income in 
a proportional amount from net sale proceeds, as further set forth in 
the Assistance Agreement. If the Housing is not sold to an Eligible-
Income Family after the five-year anniversary of the Purchase date and 
the Recipient recoups a proportional amount of the CMF Awards as 
Program Income, the Recipient is not required to replace the sold 
Housing with a replacement unit.
    (2) The Recipient may design and implement its own recoupment, 
replacement, and/or resale strategy, subject to the requirements of 
Sec.  1807.402(a)(1)(vi) to maintain compliance with the CMF 
requirements and the Assistance Agreement. Deed restrictions, covenants 
running with the land, or other similar instruments may be used as the 
mechanism to impose a strategy. The Recipient shall report to the CDFI 
Fund the event of resale and/or recoupment and redeployment of the CMF 
Award, or an equivalent amount, in the manner described in the 
Assistance Agreement or other guidance issued by the CDFI Fund.
    (3) The affordability restrictions are allowed to terminate upon 
occurrence of any of the following termination events: foreclosure, 
transfer in lieu of foreclosure, or assignment of an FHA-insured 
mortgage to HUD. The termination of the affordability restrictions 
pursuant to any of the aforementioned terminating events will result in 
the Housing no longer being subject to a recoupment, replacement, and/
or resale strategy as previously imposed by the Recipient. The 
Recipient may use purchase options, rights of first refusal or other 
preemptive rights to purchase the Housing before foreclosure to 
preserve affordability. The affordability restrictions shall be revived 
according to the original terms if, during the original Affordability 
Period, the owner of record before the termination event obtains an 
ownership interest in the Housing.
    (b) Rehabilitation not involving purchase. Single-family housing 
that is currently owned by a qualifying Family, as set forth in Sec.  
1807.400, qualifies as Affordable Housing if it meets the following 
requirements of this paragraph (b):
    (1) The estimated value of the Single-family housing, after 
Rehabilitation, does not exceed the purchase price limits for the area, 
as used in the HUD FHA Section 203(b) Mortgage Insurance Program, or 
any other index designated by the CDFI Fund. The underlying mortgage(s) 
should be affordable for the Homebuyer;
    (2) The Single-family housing is owned by a qualifying Family as 
set forth in Sec.  1807.400 and is the only principal residence of the 
Family at the time of Project Commitment and remains the principal 
residence of the Family throughout the Affordability Period as 
described in paragraph (b)(3) of this section;
    (3) Single-family housing under this paragraph (b) must meet the 
affordability requirements during the Affordability Period upon Project 
Completion or meet the recoupment, replacement, and/or resale 
provisions of paragraph (a)(5) of this section; and
    (4) Single-family housing under this paragraph (b) currently owned 
by a qualifying Family may be rehabilitated to convert a portion of the 
Housing into one to three permanent additional units, each with a 
separate means of ingress/egress, kitchen, sleeping area, bathing area, 
and bathroom facilities, independent of the primary dwelling. The 
additional units may be rented as Permanent Housing as long as the 
primary dwelling remains the principal residence of the Family. While 
the Affordability Period applies to the primary dwelling, it does not 
apply to the additional units discussed in this section.

[[Page 53022]]

    (c) Ownership interest. The owner must meet the definition of 
Homebuyer and the ownership in the Single-family housing assisted under 
this section must meet the definition of Homeownership as defined in 
Sec.  1807.104.
    (d) New construction without Purchase. Newly constructed Single-
family housing that is built on property currently owned by a Family 
that will occupy the Single-family housing upon Project Completion, 
qualifies as Affordable Housing if it meets the requirements under

tenants. Rental CMF Units may be converted to Homeownership units by 
selling, donating, or otherwise conveying the units to the existing 
tenants only under an existing documented rent-to-own program to enable 
the tenants to become Homebuyers in accordance with the requirements of 
this section. The Homeownership units are subject to a minimum period 
of affordability equal to the remaining rental Affordability Period, as 
further specified in the Assistance Agreement.
