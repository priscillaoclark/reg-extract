Background

    The Kingpin Act became law on December 3, 1999. The Act provides a 
statutory framework for the President to impose sanctions against 
significant foreign narcotics traffickers and their organizations on a 
worldwide basis, with the objective of denying their businesses and 
agents access to the U.S. financial system and to the benefits of trade 
and transactions involving U.S. companies and individuals.
    The Kingpin Act blocks all property and interests in property, 
subject to U.S. jurisdiction, owned or controlled by significant 
foreign narcotics traffickers as identified by the President. In 
addition, the Secretary of the Treasury consults with the Attorney 
General, the Director of the Central Intelligence Agency, the Director 
of the Federal Bureau of Investigation, the Administrator of the Drug 
Enforcement Administration, the Secretary of Defense, the Secretary of 
State, and the Secretary of Homeland Security when designating and 
blocking the property of interests in property, subject to U.S. 
jurisdiction, of persons who are found to be: (1) Materially assisting 
in, or providing financial or technological support for or to, or 
providing goods or services in support of, the international narcotics 
trafficking activities of a person designated pursuant to the Kingpin 
Act; (2) owned, controlled, or directed by, or acting for or on behalf 
of, a person designated pursuant to the Kingpin Act; or (3) playing a 
significant role in international narcotics trafficking.
    In order to carry out the purposes of the Kingpin Act, the 
Secretary of the Treasury is authorized by the Kingpin Act to block 
during the pendency of an investigation all property and interests in 
property of any foreign country or a national thereof that are subject 
to the jurisdiction of the United States.
    On October 22, 2008, the Acting Director of OFAC removed from the 
list of Specially Designated Nationals and Blocked Persons the 
individuals listed below, whose property and interests in property were 
blocked pending investigation pursuant to the Kingpin Act.
    The listing of the unblocked individuals follows:
    1. LUNA RIVERA, Guadalupe Rocio (a.k.a. LUNA DE ARREOLA, Guadalupe
