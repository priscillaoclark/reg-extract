AGENCY: National Labor Relations Board.

ACTION: Withdrawal of proposed rulemaking.

-----------------------------------------------------------------------

SUMMARY: This document withdraws a proposed rule that was published in 
the Federal Register on September 23, 2019, as corrected on October 16, 
2019. The proposed rule would have established that students who 
perform any services for compensation, including, but not limited to, 
teaching or research, at a private college or university in connection 
with their studies are not ``employees'' within the meaning of the 
National Labor Relations Act.

DATES: As of March 15, 2021, the proposed rule published on September 
23, 2019, at 84 FR 49691, and corrected on October 16, 2019, at 84 FR 
55265, is withdrawn.

FOR FURTHER INFORMATION CONTACT: Roxanne L. Rothschild, Executive 
Secretary, National Labor Relations Board, 1015 Half Street SE, 
Washington, DC 20570-0001, (202) 273-1940 (this is not a toll-free

SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION: The National Labor Relations Board is 
withdrawing the notice of proposed rulemaking that was published in the 
Federal Register on September 23, 2019 (84 FR 49691), and corrected on 
October 16, 2019 (84 FR 55265). The document proposed a rule 
establishing that students who perform any services for compensation, 
including, but not limited to, teaching or research, at a private 
college or university in connection with their studies are not 
``employees'' within the meaning of Section 2(3) of the National Labor 
Relations Act. The Board has decided to withdraw this rulemaking 
proceeding based on its judgment respecting the most effective 
allocation of the Board's limited resources at this time. In light of 
competing agency priorities, the Board has determined to focus its time 
and resources on the adjudication of cases currently in progress.

    Dated: Washington, DC, March 9, 2021.

    By direction of the Board.
Roxanne L. Rothschild,
Executive Secretary.
