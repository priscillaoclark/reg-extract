SECURITIES AND EXCHANGE COMMISSION

[SEC File No. 270-609, OMB Control No. 3235-0706]


Proposed Collection; Comment Request; Extension: Form ABS-EE

Upon Written Request Copies Available From: Securities and Exchange 
Commission, Office of FOIA Services, 100 F Street NE, Washington, DC 
20549-2736.

    Notice is hereby given that, pursuant to the Paperwork Reduction 
Act of 1995 (44 U.S.C. 3501 et seq.), the Securities and Exchange 
Commission (``Commission'') is soliciting comments on the collection of 
information summarized below. The Commission plans to submit this 
existing collection of information to the Office of Management and 
Budget for extension and approval.
    Form ABS-EE (17 CFR 249.1401) is filed by asset-backed issuers to 
provide asset-level information for registered offerings of asset-
backed securities at the time of securitization and on an ongoing basis 
required by Item 1111(h) of Regulation AB (17 CFR 229.1111(h)). The 
purpose of the information collected on Form ABS-EE is to implement the 
disclosure requirements of Section 7(c) of the Securities Act of 1933 
(15 U.S.C. 77g(c)) to provide information regarding the use of 
representations and warranties in the asset-backed securities markets. 
Form ABS-EE takes approximately 50.87152 hours per response to prepare 
and is filed by 5,463 securitizers annually. We estimate that 25% of 
the approximately 50.87152 hours per response (12.71788 hours) is 
prepared by the securitizers internally for a total annual reporting 
burden of 69,478 hours (12.71788 hours per response x 5,463 responses).
    Written comments are invited on: (a) whether this proposed 
collection of information is necessary for the proper performance of 
the functions of the agency, including whether the information will 
have practical utility; (b) the accuracy of the agency's estimate of 
the burden imposed by the collection of information; (c) ways to 
enhance the quality, utility, and clarity of the information collected; 
and (d) ways to minimize the burden of the collection of information on 
respondents, including through the use of automated collection 
techniques or other forms of information technology. Consideration will 
be given to comments and suggestions submitted in writing within 60 
days of this publication by June 17, 2024.
    An agency may not conduct or sponsor, and a person is not required 
to respond to, a collection of information unless it displays a 
currently valid control number.
    Please direct your written comment to David Bottom, Director/Chief 
Information Officer, Securities and Exchange Commission, c/o John 
Pezzullo, 100 F Street NE, Washington, DC 20549 or send an email to:

Secretary.
