Proposed Agency Information Collection Activities; Comment 
Request

AGENCY: Office of the Comptroller of the Currency (OCC), Treasury; 
Board of Governors of the Federal Reserve System (Board); and Federal 
Deposit Insurance Corporation (FDIC).

ACTION: Joint notice and request for comment.

-----------------------------------------------------------------------

SUMMARY: In accordance with the requirements of the Paperwork Reduction 
Act of 1995 (PRA), the OCC, the Board, and the FDIC (collectively, the 
``agencies'') may not conduct or sponsor, and the respondent is not 
required to respond to, an information collection unless it displays a 
currently valid Office of Management and Budget (OMB) control number. 
On January 19, 2024, the agencies under the auspices of the Federal 
Financial Institutions Examination Council (FFIEC), requested public 
comment for 60 days on a proposal to revise and extend the Foreign 
Branch Report of Condition (FFIEC 030) and the Abbreviated Foreign 
Branch Report of Condition (FFIEC 030S), which are currently approved 
collections of information. These proposed revisions would incorporate 
line items from the FR 2502q, Quarterly Report of Assets and 
Liabilities of Large Foreign Offices of U.S. Banks (OMB Control No. 
7100-0079) into the FFIEC 030. There are no proposed revisions to the 
FFIEC 030S. As described in the SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION section, the 
agencies are proceeding with the proposed revisions, but with certain 
modifications. In addition, the agencies will make clarifying revisions 
to the instructions in response to a comment received. The agencies are 
giving notice that they are sending the collections to OMB for review.

DATES: Comments must be submitted on or before November 6, 2024.

ADDRESSES: Interested parties are invited to submit written comments to 
any or all of the agencies. All comments, which should refer to the 
``FFIEC 030 or FFIEC 030S,'' will be shared among the agencies.

    Estimated Total Annual Burden: 14.77 burden hours.

II. Legal Basis and Need for Collection

    This information collection is mandatory: 12 U.S.C. 602 (Board); 12 
U.S.C. 161 and 602 (OCC); and 12 U.S.C. 1828 (FDIC). This information 
collection is given confidential treatment under 5 U.S.C. 552(b)(4) and 
(8).
    The FFIEC 030 collects asset and liability information for foreign 
branches of insured U.S. banks and insured U.S. savings associations 
(U.S. depository institutions) and is required for regulatory and 
supervisory purposes. The information is used to analyze the foreign 
operations of U.S. institutions. All foreign branches of U.S. 
institutions regardless of charter type file this report as provided in 
the instructions to the FFIEC 030 and FFIEC 030S. A U.S. depository 
institution generally must file a separate report for each foreign 
branch, but in some cases may consolidate filing for multiple foreign 
branches in the same country, as described below.
    A branch with either total assets of at least $2 billion or 
commitments to purchase foreign currencies and U.S. dollar exchange of 
at least $5 billion as of the end of a calendar quarter is considered a 
``significant branch'' and an FFIEC 030 report is required to be filed 
quarterly. A U.S. depository institution with a foreign branch having 
total assets in excess of $250 million that does not meet either of the 
criteria to file quarterly must file the entire FFIEC 030 report for 
this foreign branch on an annual basis as of December 31, with respect 
to this foreign branch.
    A U.S. depository institution with a foreign branch having total 
assets of $50 million, but less than or equal to $250 million that does 
not meet the criteria to file the FFIEC 030 report must file the FFIEC 
030S report for this foreign branch on an annual basis as of December 
31. A U.S. depository institution with a foreign branch having total 
assets of less than $50 million is exempt from filing the FFIEC 030 and 
030S reports.

III. Current Actions

    On January 19, 2024, the agencies proposed revisions to the FFIEC 
030 that would incorporate line items from the FR 2502q. The comment 
period for the January notice ended on March 19, 2024. The agencies 
received comments from two banking associations. These comments were 
generally supportive of the proposed new line items. After reviewing 
the comments, the agencies are moving forward with the proposed 
revisions to the FFIEC 030, with certain modifications. The specific 
comments, the agencies' responses, and pertinent modifications follow.
    First, one commenter urged the agencies to limit the scope of 
respondents subject to the proposed Schedule RAL-A to those that meet 
the current criteria to file the FR 2502q. The commenter stated that 
there are significant scoping differences between the FR 2502q and the 
FFIEC 030. The FR 2502q reporting is limited to branches with total 
assets of $2 billion or more and that are located in the United Kingdom 
(U.K.) or the Caribbean. The FFIEC 030 quarterly reporting 
requirements, however, scope in any branch with either total assets of 
at least $2 billion or commitments to purchase foreign currencies and 
U.S. dollar exchange (a purchase of U.S. dollar exchange is equivalent 
to a sale of foreign currency) of at least $5 billion as of the end of 
a calendar quarter. The commenter stated that the FFIEC 030's reporting 
scope, without the geographic limitation to branches in the U.K. and 
the Caribbean, results in a much greater reporting burden on firms.
    Furthermore, this commenter also stated that the proposed changes 
and increased granularity of the items reported would necessitate both 
the development of new systems, as well as modifications to existing 
ones. For example, the commenter noted the amount to be reported on 
proposed Schedule RAL-A, line item 5, ``Assets that are claims on U.S. 
addressees other than depository institutions,'' includes new sub-line 
items that are more granular than the amount currently reported in FR 
2502q item 1.c, ``U.S. addresses other than depository institutions,'' 
and would increase burden to all filers of the FFIEC 030. This 
reporting burden would be greatest on respondents that have newly 
scoped-in entities that would be reporting this information for the 
first time. In light of this, the commenter requested that, if the 
scope of respondents on the proposed FFIEC 030 Schedule RAL-A is not 
limited to those that currently meet the criteria to file the FR 2502q, 
branches would need at least four quarters from publication of the 
final forms and instructions to implement the revisions. However, if 
the scope were limited to branches that meet the current criteria to 
file the FR 2502q, branches would only need two additional quarters to 
implement the proposal.
    The agencies acknowledge that branches may need additional time to 
develop their reporting systems to implement these changes. As such, 
the agencies will delay the implementation date based on the branch 
meeting the criteria to file the FR 2502q. Beginning as of the March 
31, 2025, report date, all branches that are located in the U.K. or 
Caribbean (that are not located in a U.S. military facility), and with 
total assets of at least $2 billion (as reported in Schedule RAL, item 
11) as of the end of the calendar quarter, must complete new Schedule 
RAL-A. Beginning as of the December 31, 2025, report date, all branches 
required to report the FFIEC 030 on a quarterly basis must complete new 
Schedule RAL-A without any geographic limitation of being located in 
the U.K. or Caribbean. Branches that file the FFIEC 030 on an annual 
basis do not need to report the new items. The FFIEC 030 instructions 
will be updated to reflect these changes.
    Second, the commenter requested that the agencies clarify the 
reporting of proposed Schedule RAL-A, line item 5, ``Assets that are 
claims on U.S. addressees other than depository institutions,'' by 
adding a Micro Data Reference Manual (MDRM) number and to include in 
the instructions that this line item is not an aggregate total of its 
sub-items. The commenter also requested that the agencies clarify 
whether Schedule RAL-A, line item 6, ``Liabilities to U.S. addressees 
other than depository institutions,'' is intended to extend to all 
liabilities or if respondents should report only deposit liabilities. 
In response, the agencies are revising the report form by adding a MDRM 
to line item 5 on Schedule RAL-A and also clarifying in the 
instructions that line item 5 on Schedule RAL-A is not an aggregate 
total of sub-items 5.a through 5.d. The agencies are also clarifying in 
the instructions of Scheduled RAL-A, line item 6, that it is intended 
to extend to all liabilities and not only to deposit liabilities.
    Lastly, separate from this proposal, on June 7, 2024, the Board 
published in the Federal Register an initial notice \1\ requesting 
public comment for 60 days on the extension with revision to the 
Financial Statements of Foreign Subsidiaries of U.S. Banking 
Organizations (FR 2314). The comment period of the June notice ended on 
August 6, 2024, and the Board received a comment from a banking trade 
organization regarding the proposed changes to the FFIEC 030. 
Specifically, the commenter requested clarification on the reporting of 
claims/liabilities with related institutions on the FFIEC 030. In the 
proposed instructions of

[[Page 81140]]

Schedule RAL-A line items 5 and 6, it states to ``Report claims/
liabilities on U.S. addressees other than parent bank and other 
depository institutions'' and contains no specific instructions on how 
to treat claims/liabilities with related institutions. However, on the 
proposed FR 2314 Schedule BS-Q line items 3 and 4, the instructions 
explicitly state to ``exclude balances with related institutions.''
---------------------------------------------------------------------------

    \1\ See 89 FR 48639.
---------------------------------------------------------------------------

    The commenter requested that the Board work with the other agencies 
to clarify that balances with related institutions, as defined in FFIEC 
030S and reported in FFIEC 030 proposed Schedule RAL-A items 1-4, 
should be excluded for the purposes of FFIEC 030 Schedule RAL-A items 5 
and 6. In response to the commenter, to make the instructions more 
parallel between the FFIEC 030 and FR 2314, the agencies will clarify 
in the FFIEC 030 instructions to explicitly exclude balances with 
related institutions from the amounts reported in Schedule RAL-A, items 
5 and 6.

IV. Timing

    The proposed revisions to the FFIEC 030 would be effective as of 
the March 31, 2025, report date for branches that currently meet the 
criteria to file the FR 2502q (i.e., those located in the U.K. or 
Caribbean). For a branch that does not meet the current criteria to 
file the FR 2502q, but files the FFIEC 030 on a quarterly basis, the 
effective date for these new items will be as of December 31, 2025.

V. Request for Comment

    Public comment is requested on all aspects of this joint notice. 
Comment is specifically invited on:
    (a) Whether the information collection is necessary for the proper 
performance of the agencies' functions, including whether the 
information has practical utility;
    (b) The accuracy of the agencies' estimate of the burden of the 
information collection, including the validity of the methodology and 
assumptions used;
    (c) Ways to enhance the quality, utility, and clarity of the 
information to be collected;
    (d) Ways to minimize the burden of the information collection on 
respondents, including through the use of automated collection 
techniques or other forms of information technology; and
    (e) Estimates of capital or startup costs and costs of operation, 
maintenance, and purchase of services to provide information.
    Comments submitted in response to this joint notice will be shared 
among the agencies.
