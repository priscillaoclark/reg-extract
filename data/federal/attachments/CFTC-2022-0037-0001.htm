SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION: Under the PRA, 44 U.S.C. 3501 et seq., 
Federal agencies must obtain approval from the Office of Management and 
Budget (``OMB'') for each collection of information they conduct or 
sponsor. ``Collection of information'' is defined in 44 U.S.C. 3502(3) 
and 5 CFR 1320.3(c) and includes agency requests or requirements that 
members of the public submit reports, keep records, or provide 
information to a third party. Section 3506(c)(2)(A) of the PRA, 44 
U.S.C. 3506(c)(2)(A), requires Federal agencies to provide a 60-day 
notice in the Federal Register concerning each proposed collection of 
information, including each proposed extension of an existing 
collection of information, before submitting the collection to OMB for 
approval. To comply with this requirement, the Commission is publishing 
notice of the proposed collection of information listed below.
    Title: Procurement Contracts (OMB Control No. 3038-0031). This is a 
request for an extension of a currently approved information 
collection.
    Abstract: The information collected under this request is gathered 
through the use of forms specific to a contract or contracting action. 
The standard forms are prescribed for use for non-personal services, 
construction, award of contracts and solicitations as by agencies in 
connection with the procurement of supplies, purchase and delivery 
orders, specified in the Federal Acquisition Regulations (48 CFR 1-53). 
The information provided on the forms is specific and generally does 
not require additional information or questions.
    With respect to the following collection of information, the 
Commission invites comments on:
    <bullet> Whether the proposed collection of information is 
necessary for the proper performance of the functions of the 
Commission, including whether the information will have a practical 
use;
    <bullet> The accuracy of the Commission's estimate of the burden of 
the proposed collection of information, including the validity of the 
methodology and assumptions used;
    <bullet> Ways to enhance the quality, usefulness, and clarity of 
the information to be collected; and
    <bullet> Ways to minimize the burden of collection of information 
on those who are to respond, including through the use of appropriate 
electronic, mechanical, or other technological collection techniques or 
other forms of information technology; e.g., permitting electronic 
submission of responses.
    You should submit only information that you wish to make available 
publicly. If you wish the Commission to consider information that you 
believe is exempt from disclosure under the Freedom of Information Act, 
a petition for confidential treatment of the exempt information may be 
submitted according to the procedures established in Sec.  145.9 of the 
Commission's regulations.
    The Commission reserves the right, but shall have no obligation, to 
review, pre-screen, filter, redact, refuse or remove any or all of your 
submission from <a href="http://www.cftc.gov">http://www.cftc.gov</a> that it may deem to be 
inappropriate for publication, such as obscene language. All 
submissions that have been redacted or removed that contain comments on 
the merits of the information collection request will be retained in 
the public comment file and will be considered as required under the 
Administrative Procedure Act and other applicable laws, and may be 
accessible under the Freedom of Information Act.
    Burden Statement: The Commission is revising its estimate of the 
burden for this collection to reflect changed circumstances below.
    The information collection consists of procurement activities 
relating to solicitations, amendments to solicitations, requests for 
quotations, construction contracts, awards of contracts, performance 
bonds, and payment information for individuals (vendors) or contractors 
engaged in providing supplies or services.
    The Commission estimates the burden of this collection of 
information as follows:
    Respondents/Affected Entities: Vendors and contractors.
    Estimated number of respondents: 1,096.
    Estimated burden hours per response: 2 hours.
    Estimated total annual burden on respondents: 2,192 hours.
    Frequency of responses: Annually.
    There are no capital costs or operating and maintenance costs 
associated with this collection.

(Authority: 44 U.S.C. 3501 et seq.)

    Dated: June 27, 2022.
Robert Sidman,
Deputy Secretary of the Commission.
