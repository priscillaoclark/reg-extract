Notice of CFIUS Action

    The Committee, taking into consideration the factors identified on

determined, under the authority of section 721 of the Defense 
Production Act of 1950, as amended, and 31 CFR 800.1001(a), that: (1) 
the United Kingdom of Great Britain and Northern Ireland has 
established and is effectively utilizing a robust process to analyze 
foreign investments for national security risks and to facilitate 
coordination with the United States on matters relating to investment 
security; and (2) New Zealand has established and is effectively 
utilizing a robust process to analyze foreign investments for national

    This determination satisfies the second criterion in the definition 
of excepted foreign state under 31 CFR 800.218 with respect to New 
Zealand and the United Kingdom of Great Britain and Northern Ireland. 
Therefore, New Zealand and the United Kingdom of Great Britain and 
Northern Ireland are and will remain excepted foreign states absent 
further Committee action and notice in the Federal Register.
