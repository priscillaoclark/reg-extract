Background

    The Sudanese Sanctions Regulations, 31 CFR part 538 (the ``SSR''), 
were promulgated to implement Executive Order 13067 of November 3, 1997 
(``E.O. 13067''), in which the President declared a national emergency 
with respect to the policies and actions of the Government of Sudan. To 
deal with that emergency, E.O. 13067 imposed comprehensive trade 
sanctions with respect to Sudan and blocked all property and interests 
in property of the Government of Sudan in the United States or within 
the possession or control of United States persons.
    On October 13, 2006, the President signed into law the Darfur Peace 
and Accountability Act of 2006 (the ``DPAA''), which, among other 
things, calls for support of the regional government of Southern Sudan, 
assistance with the peace efforts in Darfur, and provision of economic 
assistance in specified areas of Sudan. In particular, section 7 of the 
DPAA requires the continuation of the sanctions currently imposed on 
the Government of Sudan pursuant to E.O. 13067. However, section 8(e) 
of the DPAA exempts from the prohibitions of E.O. 13067 activities or 
related transactions with respect to certain areas in Sudan, including 
Southern Sudan, Southern Kordofan/Nuba Mountains State, Blue Nile 
State, Abyei, Darfur, and marginalized areas in and around Khartoum.
    To reconcile sections 7 and 8(e) of the DPAA and to maintain in 
place sanctions on the Government of Sudan, the President issued 
Executive Order 13412 on October 13, 2006 (``E.O. 13412''). In E.O. 
13412, the President determined that the Government of Sudan continues 
to implement policies and actions that violate human rights, in 
particular with respect to the conflict in Darfur, and that the 
Government of Sudan plays a pervasive role in Sudan's petroleum and 
petrochemical industries, thus constituting a threat to U.S. national 
security and foreign policy.
    In light of these determinations, and in order to take additional 
steps with respect to the national emergency declared in E.O. 13067, 
section 1 of E.O. 13412 continues the blocking of the Government of 
Sudan's property and interests in property that are in or come within 
the United States, or that are in or come within the possession or 
control of United States persons. Section 2 of E.O. 13412 prohibits 
transactions by United States persons relating to the petroleum or 
petrochemical industries in Sudan, including, but not limited to, 
oilfield services and oil or gas pipelines. Both sections 1 and 2 of 
E.O. 13412 apply to the entire territory of Sudan.
    Section 4 of E.O. 13412, consistent with section 8(e) of the DPAA, 
provides that the prohibitions contained in section 2 of E.O. 13067 no 
longer apply to activities or related transactions with respect to 
Southern Sudan, Southern Kordofan/Nuba Mountains State, Blue Nile 
State, Abyei, Darfur, or marginalized areas in and around Khartoum, 
provided that the transactions do not involve any property or interests 
in property of the Government of Sudan. Section 4(b)(ii) of E.O. 13412 
authorizes the Secretary of State, after consultation with the 
Secretary of the Treasury, to define the geographic areas of Southern 
Sudan, Southern Kordofan/Nuba Mountains State, Blue Nile State, Abyei, 
Darfur, and marginalized areas in and around Khartoum for purposes of 
the order. In addition, section 6(d) of E.O. 13412 defines the term 
``Government of Sudan'' to include its agencies, instrumentalities, and 
controlled entities, and the Central Bank of Sudan, but to exclude the 
regional government of Southern Sudan.
    In accordance with E.O. 13412, the Office of Foreign Assets Control 
(``OFAC'') today is amending the SSR to add several new provisions 
implementing the provisions of E.O. 13412 discussed above. First, OFAC 
is renumbering Sec. Sec.  538.210 and 538.211 as Sec. Sec.  538.211 and 
538.212, respectively, in order to add a new Sec.  538.210. Paragraph 
(a) of new Sec.  538.210 prohibits all transactions by United States 
persons relating to the petroleum or petrochemical industries in Sudan, 
including, but not limited to, oilfield services and oil or gas 
pipelines. Paragraph (b) of Sec.  538.210 prohibits the facilitation by 
a United States person of any transaction relating to Sudan's petroleum 
or petrochemical industries.
    Second, OFAC is adding an exemption to newly renumbered Sec.  
538.212. Paragraph (g)(1) of Sec.  538.212 provides that, except for 
the provisions of Sec. Sec.  538.201-203, 538.210, and 538.211, and 
except as provided in paragraph (g)(2) of Sec.  538.212, the 
prohibitions contained in the SSR do not apply to activities or related 
transactions with respect to the Specified Areas of Sudan. This 
provision means that, subject to the new interpretive sections set 
forth below, activities and related transactions with respect to the 
Specified Areas of Sudan are no longer prohibited, unless they involve 
any property or interests in property of the Government of Sudan or 
relate to Sudan's petroleum or petrochemical industries. In addition, 
paragraph (g)(2) of Sec.  538.212 states that the exemption does not 
apply to the exportation or reexportation of agricultural commodities, 
medicine, and medical devices. Section 906 of the Trade Sanctions 
Reform and Export Enhancement Act of 2000 (Pub. L. 106-387) continues 
to impose licensing requirements on these transactions, regardless of 
the intended destination in Sudan. These licensing requirements are 
implemented in Sec. Sec.  538.523, 538.525, and 538.526.
    Third, OFAC is revising the definition of the term Government of 
Sudan contained in Sec.  538.305 to exclude the regional government of 
Southern Sudan, as set forth in section 6(d) of E.O. 13412.
    Fourth, OFAC is adding a new definitional section to identify the 
areas of Sudan that were exempted in section 4(b) of E.O. 13412 from 
the prohibitions contained in section 2 of E.O. 13067. New Sec.  
538.320 defines the term Specified Areas of Sudan to mean Southern 
Sudan, Southern Kordofan/Nuba Mountains State, Blue Nile State, Abyei, 
Darfur, and marginalized areas in and around Khartoum. This section 
also defines the term ``marginalized areas in and around Khartoum'' to 
refer to four official camps for internally displaced persons.
    Fifth, OFAC is adding interpretive Sec.  538.417 to clarify that 
all of the prohibitions in the SSR apply to shipments of goods, 
services, and technology that transit areas of Sudan other than the 
Specified Areas of Sudan. Section 538.417(a) provides that an 
exportation or reexportation of goods, technology, or services to the 
Specified Areas of Sudan is exempt under Sec.  538.212(g) only if it 
does not transit or transship through any area of Sudan other than the 
Specified Areas of Sudan. Section 538.417(b) provides that an 
importation into the United States of goods or services from, or 
originating in, the Specified Areas of Sudan is exempt under Sec.  
538.212(g) only if it does not

[[Page 61515]]

transit or transship through any area of Sudan other than the Specified 
Areas of Sudan. Thus, imports and exports to or from the Specified 
Areas of Sudan that do not transit or transship non-exempt areas of 
Sudan are not prohibited, provided that the Government of Sudan does 
not have an interest in the transaction and the transaction does not 
relate to Sudan's petroleum or petrochemical industries. However, 
imports and exports to or from the Specified Areas of Sudan that 
involve the transiting of, or transshipment through, non-exempt areas 
of Sudan, e.g., Khartoum and Port Sudan, require authorization from 
OFAC.
    OFAC is also adding interpretive Sec.  538.418 to explain the 
prohibitions on financial transactions in Sudan. Financial transactions 
are no longer prohibited by the SSR if: (1) The underlying activity is 
not prohibited by the SSR; (2) the financial transaction involves a 
third-country depository institution, or a Sudanese depository 
institution not owned or controlled by the Government of Sudan, that is 
located in the Specified Areas of Sudan; and (3) the financial 
transaction is not routed through a depository institution that is 
located in the non-exempt areas or that is owned or controlled by the 
Government of Sudan, wherever located. However, any financial 
transactions that involve, in any manner, depository institutions that 
are located in the non-exempt areas of Sudan, e.g., Khartoum, remain 
prohibited and require authorization from OFAC.
    For example, if a financial transaction involves a branch of a 
depository institution in the Specified Areas of Sudan, but that 
depository institution is headquartered in Khartoum and requires all 
financial transactions to be routed through the headquarters or another 
branch located in the non-exempt areas of Sudan, that transaction is 
prohibited and requires authorization from OFAC.
    Finally, OFAC is amending the SSR to add three new general 
licenses, which are set forth in Sec. Sec.  538.530, 538.531, and 
538.532. Paragraph (a) of Sec.  538.530 provides that all general 
licenses issued pursuant to E.O. 13067 are authorized and remain in 
effect pursuant to E.O. 13412. Paragraph (b) of Sec.  538.530 provides 
that all specific licenses and all nongovernmental organization 
registrations issued pursuant to E.O. 13067 or the SSR prior to October 
13, 2006, are authorized pursuant to E.O. 13412 and remain in effect 
until the expiration date specified in the license or registration, or 
if no expiration date is specified, June 30, 2008. OFAC urges all 
license and nongovernmental organization registration holders to take 
note of this potentially new expiration date, which applies to all 
licenses and registrations that do not otherwise contain an expiration 
date, regardless of when they were originally issued.
    The second general license, new Sec.  538.531, authorizes otherwise 
prohibited official activities of the United States Government and 
international organizations. Subject to certain conditions and 
limitations, paragraph (a)(1) of Sec.  538.531 authorizes all 
transactions and activities otherwise prohibited by the SSR or E.O. 
13412 that are for the conduct of the official business of the United 
States Government by contractors or grantees thereof. Employees who 
engage in transactions for the conduct of the official business of the 
United States Government already are exempt from these prohibitions. 
See Sec.  538.212(e) and section 5(a) of E.O. 13412. Paragraph (a)(2) 
of Sec.  538.531 authorizes, subject to the same conditions and 
limitations as paragraph (a)(1), all transactions and activities 
otherwise prohibited by the SSR or E.O. 13412 that are for the conduct 
of the official business of the United Nations, or United Nations 
specialized agencies, programmes, and funds, by employees, contractors, 
or grantees thereof. Paragraphs (b), (c), and (d) of Sec.  538.531 set 
forth conditions and limitations on the authorizations described in 
paragraph (a).
    The third general license, Sec.  538.532, authorizes humanitarian 
transshipments of goods, technology, or services through non-exempt 
areas of Sudan to or from Southern Sudan and Darfur. This license will 
be subject to review on an annual basis. Upon completion of the annual 
review, OFAC may revoke the general license through the issuance of a 
notice in the Federal Register. If OFAC does not take any action, this 
license will remain in force.

Public Participation

    Because the amendment of the SSR involve a foreign affairs 
function, Executive Order 12866 and the provisions of the 
Administrative Procedure Act (5 U.S.C. 553) requiring notice of 
proposed rulemaking, opportunity for public participation, and delay in 
effective date are inapplicable. Because no notice of proposed 
rulemaking is required for this rule, the Regulatory Flexibility Act (5 
U.S.C. 601-612) does not apply.

Paperwork Reduction Act

    The collections of information related to the SSR are contained in 
31 CFR part 501 (the ``Reporting, Procedures and Penalties 
Regulations''). Pursuant to the Paperwork Reduction Act of 1995 (44 
U.S.C. 3507), those collections of information have been approved by 
the Office of Management and Budget under control number 1505-0164. An 
agency may not conduct or sponsor, and a person is not required to 
respond to, a collection of information unless the collection of 
information displays a valid control number.

7. Add a new Sec.  538.418 to read as follows:


Sec.  538.418  Financial transactions in Sudan.

    (b) Financial transactions are no longer prohibited by this part

    (1) The underlying activity is not prohibited by this part;
    (2) The financial transaction involves a third-country depository 
institution, or a Sudanese depository institution not owned or 
controlled by the Government of Sudan, that is located in the Specified

Abyei branch of a Sudanese bank that is not owned or controlled by the 
Government of Sudan. In order for the transfer to take place, the U.S. 
bank is required to route the funds through the Sudanese bank's 
headquarters, which is located in Khartoum. Due to the routing of the 
financial transaction through Khartoum, this transaction is prohibited 
and requires authorization from the Office of Foreign Assets Control. 
However, if the U.S. bank is able to bypass the Khartoum headquarters 
and transfer the funds directly to the Abyei branch of the Sudanese 
bank, then the transaction would not be prohibited.
