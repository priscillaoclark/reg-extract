SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION:
    Title: Representations for Commodity Credit Corporation or Farm 
Service Agency Loans and Authorization to File a Financing Statement 
and Related Documents.
    OMB Control Number: 0560-0215.
    Expiration Date of Approval: July 31, 2021.
    Type of Request: Extension with a revision.
    Abstract: Form CCC-10, ``Representations for Commodity Credit 
Corporation or Farm Service Agency Loans and Authorization to File a 
Financing Statement and Related Documents'' is necessary to:
    (a) Gather or verify basic data, provided by a CCC or FSA loan 
applicant, that is required on a financing statement filed by CCC or 
FSA to perfect a security interest in collateral used to secure a loan; 
and
    (b) Obtain applicant permission to file a financing statement prior 
to the execution of a security agreement.
    FSA's Farm Loan Programs (FLP) uses the CCC-10 when a nonapplicant 
third party pledges the full value of chattel security to FSA as 
adequate security required for an FLP loan.
    FSA increased the number of respondents by 1,766 and the burden 
hours increased by 147. The applicants who are applying for farm loans 
to pledge security for a loan have increased since the last request. 
CCC's Marketing Assistance Loan and Farm Storage Facility Loan programs 
are exempted from Paperwork Reduction Act.
    For the following estimated total annual burden on respondents, the 
formula used to calculate the total burden hours is the estimated 
average time per response multiplied by the estimated total annual of 
responses.
    Estimated Annual Burden: The public reporting burden for this 
information collection is estimated to average 5 minutes per response 
(0.08 of an hours).
    Respondents: Individual producers and farming entities.
    Estimated Number of Respondents: 3,822.
    Estimated Number of Responses per Respondent: 1.
    Estimated Total Annual Response: 812.
    Estimated Average Time per Response: 0.08 (average 5 minutes).
    Estimated Total Annual Burden on Respondents: 385.
    We are requesting comments on all aspects of this information 
collection to help us to:
    (1) Evaluate whether the proposed collection of information is 
necessary for the proper performance of the functions of the agency, 
including whether the information will have practical utility;
    (2) Evaluate the accuracy of the agency's estimate of the burden of 
the collection of information, including the validity of the 
methodology and assumptions used;
    (3) Evaluate the quality, ability and clarity of the information 
technology; and
    (4) Minimize the burden of the information collection on those who 
respond through the use of appropriate automated, electronic, 
mechanical, or other technological collection techniques or other forms 
of information.
    All responses to this notice, including names and addresses when 
provided, will be summarized and included in the request for OMB 
approval. All comments will also become a matter of public record.

Steven Peterson,
Acting Administrator, Farm Service Agency.
