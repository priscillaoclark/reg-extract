Final Approval Under OMB Delegated Authority of the Extension for Three 
Years, With Revision, of the Following Information Collection

    Collection title: Market Risk Capital Rule (see the current actions 
section for information about a change to the collection title and 
collection identifier).
    Collection identifier: FR 4201.
    OMB control number: 7100-0314.
    Dates: The revisions are applicable as of April 26, 2024.
    General description of collection: The market risk rule, which 
requires banking organizations to hold capital to cover their exposure 
to market risk, is a component of the Board's regulatory capital 
framework, Regulation Q--Capital Adequacy of Bank Holding

[[Page 32430]]

Companies, Savings and Loan Holding Companies, and State Member Banks 
(12 CFR part 217). The rule includes information collections that 
permit the Board to monitor the market risk profile of Board-regulated 
banking organizations that have significant market risk. These 
information collections provide current statistical data identifying 
market risk areas on which to focus onsite and offsite examinations. 
They also allow the Board to assess the levels and components of each 
reporting institution's risk-based capital requirements for market risk 
and the adequacy of the institution's capital under the market risk 
rule.
    Frequency: Annual, quarterly, and on occasion.
    Respondents: Bank holding companies, covered savings and loan 
holding companies,\1\ U.S. intermediate holding companies of foreign 
banking organizations, and state member banks (collectively, banking 
organizations) that meet certain risk thresholds. The market risk rule 
applies to any such banking organization with aggregate trading assets 
and trading liabilities equal to (1) 10 percent or more of quarter-end 
total assets or (2) $1 billion or more.
---------------------------------------------------------------------------

    \1\ For the definition of ``covered savings and loan holding 
company,'' see 12 CFR 217.2.
---------------------------------------------------------------------------

    Total estimated number of respondents: 37.
    Total estimated change in burden: 592.
    Total estimated annual burden hours: 36,236.\2\
---------------------------------------------------------------------------

    \2\ More detailed information regarding this collection, 
including more detailed burden estimates, can be found in the OMB 
Supporting Statement posted at <a href="https://www.federalreserve.gov/apps/reportingforms/review">https://www.federalreserve.gov/apps/reportingforms/review</a>. On the page displayed at the link, you can 
find the OMB Supporting Statement by referencing the collection 
identifier, FR 4201.
---------------------------------------------------------------------------

    Current actions: On December 4, 2023, the Board published a notice 
in the Federal Register (88 FR 84141) requesting public comment for 60 
days on the extension, with revision, of the FR 4201. The Board 
proposed revising the FR 4201 to account for a recordkeeping 
requirement in section 217.203(b)(2) of Regulation Q that had not been 
previously cleared by the Board. The comment period for this notice 
expired on February 2, 2024. The Board did not receive any comments. 
The revisions will be implemented as proposed. This information 
collection is currently titled ``Market Risk Capital Rule'' with a 
collection identifier of ``FR 4201.'' As part of this clearance, the 
collection title will be changed to ``Reporting, Recordkeeping, and 
Disclosure Requirements Associated with Regulation Q (Market Risk 
Capital Rule)'' and the collection identifier will be updated to ``FR 
Q-2.'' The purpose of this non-substantive change is to implement 
consistent nomenclature for information collections contained within a 
rule. This change would not modify the reporting, recordkeeping, or 
disclosure requirements in any way.

    Board of Governors of the Federal Reserve System, April 23, 
2024.
Michele Taylor Fennell,
Deputy Associate Secretary of the Board.
