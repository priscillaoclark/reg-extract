    On November 8, 2023, the Cboe Exchange, Inc., Cboe C2 Exchange, 
Inc., Cboe BZX Exchange, Inc., and Cboe EDGX Exchange, Inc. filed with 
the Securities and Exchange Commission (``Commission'') a proposal 
(``Proposed Amendment'') to amend the plan of the Options Price 
Reporting Authority (``OPRA'') for reporting of consolidated options 
last sale reports and quotation information (``OPRA Plan'').\1\ The 
proposed amendment was published for comment in the Federal Register on 
January 22, 2024.\2\

    \1\ See <a href="https://cdn.opraplan.com/documents/OPRA_Plan.pdf">https://cdn.opraplan.com/documents/OPRA_Plan.pdf</a>.
    \2\ See Securities Exchange Act Release No. 99345 (Jan. 16, 
2024), 89 FR 3963 (Jan. 22, 2024) (``Notice''). Comments received in 
response to the Notice are available on the Commission's website at 
<a href="https://www.sec.gov/comments/4-820/4-820.htm">https://www.sec.gov/comments/4-820/4-820.htm</a>.
---------------------------------------------------------------------------

    On April 19, 2024, the Commission instituted proceedings pursuant 
to Rule 608(b)(2)(i) of Regulation NMS \3\ to determine whether to 
approve or disapprove the Proposed Amendment or to approve the Proposed 
Amendment with any changes or subject to any conditions the Commission 
deems necessary or appropriate.\4\ On July 11, 2024, pursuant to Rule 
608(b)(2)(i) of Regulation NMS,\5\ the Commission extended the period 
within which to conclude proceedings regarding the Proposed Amendment 
to 240 days from the date of publication of the Notice.\6\ The 240th 
day after publication of the Notice is September 18, 2024.
---------------------------------------------------------------------------

    \3\ 17 CFR 242.608(b)(2)(i).
    \4\ See Securities Exchange Act Release No. 99994 (Apr. 19, 
2024), 89 FR 31785 (Apr. 25, 2024) (``Order Instituting 
Proceedings''). Comments received in response to the Order 
Instituting Proceedings are available on the Commission's website at 
<a href="https://www.sec.gov/comments/4-820/4-820.htm">https://www.sec.gov/comments/4-820/4-820.htm</a>.
    \5\ See 17 CFR 242.608(b)(2)(i).
    \6\ See Securities Exchange Act Release No. 100495 (July 11, 
2024), 89 FR 58212 (July 17, 2024).
---------------------------------------------------------------------------

    Rule 608(b)(2)(ii) of Regulation NMS \7\ provides that the time for 
conclusion of proceedings to determine whether a national market system 
plan or proposed amendment should be disapproved may be extended for an 
additional period up to 60 days (up to 300 days from the date of notice 
publication) if the Commission determines that a longer period is 
appropriate and publishes the reasons for such determination or the 
plan participants consent to the longer period. The Commission is 
extending this 240 day period.
---------------------------------------------------------------------------

    \7\ See 17 CFR 242.608(b)(2)(ii).
---------------------------------------------------------------------------

    The Commission finds that it is appropriate to designate a longer 
period within which to conclude proceedings regarding the Proposed 
Amendment so that it has sufficient time to consider the important 
policy issues raised by the Proposed Amendment and the comments 
received. Accordingly, pursuant to Rule 608(b)(2)(ii) of Regulation 
NMS,\8\ the Commission designates November 15, 2024, as the date by 
which the Commission shall conclude the proceedings to determine 
whether to approve or disapprove the Proposed Amendment or to approve 
the Proposed Amendment with any changes or subject to any conditions 
the Commission deems necessary or appropriate (File No. 4-820).
---------------------------------------------------------------------------

    \8\ Id.

    By the Commission.
Vanessa A. Countryman,
Secretary.
