FEDERAL DEPOSIT INSURANCE CORPORATION


FDIC Advisory Committee on Economic Inclusion (ComE-IN); Notice 
of Charter Renewal

AGENCY: Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation (FDIC).

ACTION: Notice of renewal of the FDIC Advisory Committee on Economic 
Inclusion.

-----------------------------------------------------------------------

SUMMARY: Pursuant to the provisions of the Federal Advisory Committee 
Act (``FACA''), 5 U.S.C. App. 2, and after consultation with the 
General Services Administration, the Chairman of the Federal Deposit 
Insurance Corporation has determined that renewal of the FDIC Advisory 
Committee on Economic Inclusion (``the Committee'') is in the public 
interest in connection with the performance of duties imposed upon the 
FDIC by law. The Committee has been a successful undertaking by the 
FDIC and has provided valuable feedback to the agency on important 
initiatives focused on expanding access to banking services by 
underserved populations. The Committee will continue to provide advice 
and recommendations on initiatives to expand access to banking services 
by underserved populations. The Committee will continue to review 
various issues that may include, but not be limited to, basic retail 
financial services such as check cashing, money orders, remittances, 
stored value cards, short-term loans, savings accounts, and other 
services to promote asset accumulation and financial stability. The 
structure and responsibilities of the Committee are unchanged from when 
it was originally established in November 2006. The Committee will 
continue to operate in accordance with the provisions of the Federal 
Advisory Committee Act.

FOR FURTHER INFORMATION CONTACT: Mr. Robert E. Feldman, Committee 
Management Officer of the FDIC, at (202) 898-7043.

    Dated: December 21, 2010.
Valerie J. Best,
Assistant Committee Management Officer, Federal Deposit Insurance 
Corporation.
