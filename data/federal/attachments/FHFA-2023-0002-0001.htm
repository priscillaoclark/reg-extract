    FHFA seeks public comments on a new system of records and will take 
all comments into consideration. See 5 U.S.C. 552a(e)(4) and (11). In 
addition to referencing ``Comments/No. 2023-N-2,'' please reference 
``FHFA-30, Advisory Committee Manager System.''
    FHFA will make all comments timely received available for 
examination by the public through the electronic comment docket for 
this notice, which is located on the FHFA website at <a href="https://www.FHFA.gov">https://www.FHFA.gov</a>. All comments received will be posted without change and 
will include any personal information you provide, such as name, 
address (mailing and email), telephone numbers, and any other 
information you provide.

II. Introduction

    This notice informs the public of FHFA's proposal to establish and 
maintain a new system of records. This notice satisfies the Privacy Act 
requirement that an agency publishes a system of records notice in the 
Federal Register when establishing a new or making a significant change 
to an agency's system of records. Congress has recognized that 
application of all requirements of the Privacy Act to certain 
categories of records may have an undesirable and often unacceptable 
effect upon agencies in the conduct of necessary public business. 
Consequently, Congress established general exemptions and specific 
exemptions that could be used to exempt records from provisions of the 
Privacy Act. Congress also required that exempting records from 
provisions of the Privacy Act would require the head of an agency to 
publish a determination to exempt a record from the Privacy Act as a 
rule in accordance with the Administrative Procedure Act. Records and 
information in this system of records are not exempt from the 
requirements of the Privacy Act.
    As required by the Privacy Act, 5 U.S.C. 552a(r), and pursuant to 
section 7 of Office of Management and Budget (OMB) Circular No. A-108, 
``Federal Agency Responsibilities for Review, Reporting, and 
Publication under the Privacy Act'', prior to publication of this 
notice, FHFA submitted a report describing the system of records 
covered by this notice to the OMB, the Committee on Oversight and 
Government Reform of the House of Representatives, and the Committee on 
Homeland Security and Governmental Affairs of the Senate.
    In accordance with the Privacy Act of 1974, 5 U.S.C. 552a, FHFA 
proposes two new routine uses for this system, in addition to the 
general routine uses applicable to this system and described below. 
First, FHFA may disclose information to the Library of Congress, OMB, 
Executive Office of the President, or General Services Administration, 
when necessary and relevant to FHFA's management of the advisory 
committee, including FHFA's consideration of applicants for membership 
on an advisory committee, or to comply with any obligations to report 
information about advisory committees. This use is compatible with the 
purpose of the collection, which is to administer advisory committees 
in accordance with the Federal Advisory Committee Act. Second, FHFA may 
disclose information from this system to the public to inform the 
public about the identity and qualifications of individuals selected to 
serve as members of advisory committees. As one of the purposes of the 
Federal Advisory Committee Act is

[[Page 9519]]

to ensure transparency to the public about advisory committee advice 
and activities, a routine use permitting disclosure of information 
about advisory committee members is compatible with the purpose of the 
collection.

III. New System of Records

    The information in this system of records will be used by FHFA for 
storing and reviewing application materials submitted by applicants for 
membership on FHFA advisory committees/subcommittees, choosing members 
for FHFA advisory committees based on those application materials, 
managing membership on such FHFA committees, including but not limited 
to membership termination, and conducting required oversight and 
compliance over FHFA advisory committee appointments and actions. The 
new system of records is described in detail below.

committees/subcommittees.

ROUTINE USES OF RECORDS MAINTAINED IN THE SYSTEM, INCLUDING CATEGORIES

therein may specifically be disclosed outside of FHFA as a routine use 
pursuant to 5 U.S.C. 552a(b)(3) as follows, to the extent such 
disclosures are compatible with the purposes for which the information 
was collected:
    (1) To appropriate agencies, entities, and persons when: (a) FHFA 
suspects or has confirmed that there has been a breach of the system of 
records; (b) FHFA has determined that as a result of a suspected or 
confirmed breach there is a risk of harm to individuals, FHFA 
(including its information systems, programs, and operations), the 
Federal Government, or national security; and (c) the disclosure made

assist with FHFA's efforts to (i) respond to a suspected or confirmed

or confirmed breach or (b) preventing, minimizing, or remedying the 
risk of harm to individuals, the recipient agency or entity (including 
its information systems, programs, and operations), the Federal 
Government, or to national security, resulting from a suspected or 
confirmed breach.
    (3) When there is an indication of a violation or potential 
violation of law (whether civil, criminal, or regulatory in nature, and 
whether arising by general statute or particular program statute or by 
regulation, rule or order issued pursuant thereto), the relevant 
records in the system of records may be referred, as a routine use, to 
the appropriate agency (e.g., federal, state, local, tribal, foreign or 
a financial regulatory organization) charged with the responsibility of 
investigating or prosecuting such violation or charged with enforcing 
or implementing a statute, rule, regulation or order issued pursuant 
thereto.
    (4) To any individual during the course of any inquiry or 
investigation conducted by FHFA, or in connection with civil 
litigation, if FHFA has reason to believe the individual to whom the 
record is disclosed may have further information about the matters 
related thereto, and those matters appeared to be relevant and 
necessary at the time to the subject matter of the inquiry.
