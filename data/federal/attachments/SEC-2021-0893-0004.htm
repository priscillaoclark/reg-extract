SECURITIES AND EXCHANGE COMMISSION

[SEC File No. 270-451, OMB Control No. 3235-0509]


Submission for OMB Review; Comment Request; Extension: Rule 301 
of Regulation ATS

Upon Written Request, Copies Available From: Securities and Exchange 
Commission, Office of FOIA Services, 100 F Street NE, Washington, DC 
20549-2736

    Notice is hereby given that pursuant to the Paperwork Reduction Act 
of 1995 (``PRA'') (44 U.S.C. 3501 et seq.), the Securities and Exchange 
Commission (``Commission'') has submitted to the Office of Management 
and Budget (``OMB'') a request for approval of extension of the 
previously approved collection of information provided for in Rule 301 
of Regulation ATS (17 CFR 242.301) under the Securities Exchange Act of 
1934 (15 U.S.C. 78a et seq.) (``Exchange Act'').
    Regulation ATS provides a regulatory structure for alternative 
trading systems. Rule 301 of Regulation ATS contains certain record 
keeping and reporting requirements, as well as additional obligations 
that apply only to alternative trading systems with significant volume. 
The Rule requires all alternative trading systems that wish to comply 
with Regulation ATS to file an initial operation report on Form ATS. 
Alternative trading systems are also required to supply updates on Form 
ATS to the Commission describing material changes to the system, file 
quarterly transaction reports on Form ATS-R, and file cessation of 
operations reports on Form ATS. An alternative trading system with 
significant volume is required to comply with requirements for fair 
access and systems capacity, integrity, and security.
    The Commission staff estimates that entities subject to the 
requirements of Rule 301 will spend a total of approximately 2,983 
hours a year to comply with the Rule.
    Regulation ATS requires ATSs to preserve any records, for at least 
three years, made in the process of complying with the system's 
capacity, integrity and security requirements.
    An agency may not conduct or sponsor, and a person is not required 
to respond to, a collection of information under the PRA unless it 
displays a currently valid OMB control number.
    The public may view background documentation for this information 
collection at the following website: <a href="http://www.reginfo.gov">www.reginfo.gov</a>. Find this
