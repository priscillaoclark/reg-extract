    General Description of Collection: This information collection 
arises from the reporting requirements contained in 12 CFR part 336, 
subpart B, of the FDIC Rules and Regulations entitled ``Minimum 
Standards of Fitness for Employment with the Federal Deposit Insurance 
Corporation.'' This rule implements section 19 of the Resolution Trust 
Corporation Completion Act, Public Law 103-204, by (among other things) 
prescribing a certification, with attachments in some cases, relating 
to job applicants' fitness and integrity. More specifically, the 
statute provides that the FDIC shall issue regulations implementing 
provisions that prohibit any person from becoming employed by the FDIC 
who has been convicted of any felony; has been removed from, or 
prohibited from participating in the affairs of, any insured depository 
institution pursuant to any final enforcement action by any appropriate 
Federal banking agency; has demonstrated a pattern or practice of 
defalcation regarding obligations to insured depository institutions; 
or has caused a substantial loss to Federal deposit insurance funds. 
This collection of information implements these mandatory bars to 
employment through a certification, signed by job applicants prior to 
an offer of employment using Form 2120/16. There is no change in the 
methodology or substance of this information collection. The increase 
in total estimated annual burden from 88 hours in 2022 to 144 hours 
currently is due to an increase in the estimated number of respondents.
    2. Title: Purchaser Eligibility Certification.
    OMB Number: 3064-0135.
    Form Number: 7300/06.
    Affected Public: Individuals and entities wishing to purchase 
receivership assets from the FDIC.

    General Description of Collection: The FDIC is statutorily 
prohibited from selling assets held by insured depository institutions 
that have been placed under the conservatorship or receivership of the 
FDIC to individuals or entities that profited or engaged in wrongdoing 
at the expense of those failed institutions, or seriously mismanaged 
those failed institutions. This statutory prohibition is implemented by 
regulation. The FDIC uses Form No. 7300-06: Purchaser Eligibility 
Certification (PEC) to determine an entity or person's eligibility to 
purchase assets. This information collection (IC) pertains to the 
voluntary submission of the PEC by persons seeking to certify their 
eligibility to be able to purchase receivership assets. Potential 
respondents to this IC include any entity or individual that wishes to 
bid on or purchase assets held by insured depository institutions that 
have been placed under the conservatorship or receivership of the FDIC. 
There is no change in the substance of this IC. The decrease in total 
estimated annual burden from 190 hours in 2022 to 70 hours currently is 
due a decrease in the estimated number of annual respondents for cash 
sales, ORE sales, and securities sales as compared to the 2022 IC, 
reflecting the decrease in forecasted sales. This decrease is 
attenuated by the inclusion of joint venture transactions in the 
calculation of the estimated number of respondents, which were not 
included in the 2022 IC.

Request for Comment

    Comments are invited on (a) whether the collections of information 
are necessary for the proper performance of the FDIC's functions, 
including whether the information has practical utility; (b) the 
accuracy of the estimates of the burden of the information collections, 
including the validity of the methodology and assumptions used; (c) 
ways to enhance the quality, utility, and clarity of the information to 
be collected; and (d) ways to minimize the burden of the collections of 
information on respondents, including through the use of automated 
collection techniques or other forms of information technology. All 
comments will become a matter of public record.

Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation.

    Dated at Washington, DC, December 4, 2024.

Assistant Executive Secretary.
