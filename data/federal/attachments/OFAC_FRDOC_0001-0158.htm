Background

    Following the removal from power of the regime of Saddam Hussein in 
Iraq, the President issued Executive Order 13303 of May 22, 2003, under 
the authority of, inter alia, the International Emergency Economic 
Powers Act, 50 U.S.C. 1701 et seq. (``IEEPA''), the National 
Emergencies Act, 50 U.S.C. 1601 et seq. (``NEA''), and section 5 of the 
United Nations Participation Act, 22 U.S.C. 287c (``UNPA''). In 
Executive Order 13303, the President found that the threat of 
attachment or other judicial process against the Development Fund for 
Iraq, Iraqi petroleum and petroleum products, and interests therein, 
and proceeds, obligations, or financial instruments arising from or 
related to the sale or marketing thereof obstructed the orderly 
reconstruction of Iraq, the restoration and maintenance of peace and 
security in the country, and the development of political, 
administrative, and economic institutions in Iraq. The President 
further determined that this situation constituted an unusual and 
extraordinary threat to the national security and foreign policy of the 
United States and declared a national emergency to deal with that 
threat.
    To deal with this emergency, section 1 of Executive Order 13303 
provided that, unless licensed or otherwise authorized, any attachment, 
judgment, execution, or other judicial process is prohibited and shall 
be deemed null and void with respect to (1) the Development Fund for 
Iraq, and (2) all Iraqi petroleum and petroleum products, and interests 
therein, and proceeds, obligations, or any financial instruments of any 
nature arising from or related to the sale or marketing thereof, and 
interests therein, in which any foreign country or national thereof has 
any interest, that are in, or come within, the United States, or that 
are in, or come within, the possession or control of United States 
persons. Executive Order 13303 also provided that two earlier Executive 
orders that had imposed comprehensive sanctions against Iraq following 
the invasion of Kuwait, including a trade embargo and a blocking of 
Iraqi government assets (i.e., Executive Order 12722 of August 2, 1990, 
and Executive Order 12724 of August 9, 1990), as well as a more recent 
Executive order confiscating and vesting title to certain blocked Iraqi 
property (i.e., Executive Order 13290 of March 20, 2003) were not 
applicable to the property and interests in property described in 
section 1.
    On August 28, 2003, the President issued Executive Order 13315, 
under the authority of, inter alia, IEEPA, the NEA, and the UNPA, and 
in view of United Nations Security Council Resolution (``UNSCR'') 1483 
of May 22, 2003. The President issued this Order to expand the scope of 
the national emergency declared in Executive Order 13303 to address the 
unusual and extraordinary threat to the national security and foreign 
policy of the United States posed by obstacles to the orderly 
reconstruction of Iraq, the restoration and maintenance of peace and 
security in that country, and the development of its political, 
administrative, and economic institutions. The President found that the 
removal of Iraqi property from the country by certain senior officials 
of the former Iraqi regime and their family members constituted such an 
obstacle. The President determined that the United States was engaged 
in armed hostilities and that it was in the interest of the United 
States to confiscate certain additional property of the former Iraqi 
regime, certain senior officials of the former regime, immediate family 
members of those officials, and controlled entities.
    Section 1 of Executive Order 13315 blocked all property and 
interests in property in the United States or in the possession or 
control of United States persons, including any overseas branch, of: 
(1) The former Iraqi regime, (2) its state bodies, corporations, or 
agencies, (3) persons listed in the Annex to the Order, and (4) persons 
determined by the Secretary of the Treasury, in consultation with the 
Secretary of State, to be senior officials of the former Iraqi regime 
or their immediate family members or to be owned or controlled by, or 
acting or purporting to act for or on behalf of, directly or 
indirectly, any of the persons listed in the Annex or determined to be 
subject to the Order.
    Section 2 of Executive Order 13315 authorized the Secretary of the 
Treasury, in consultation with the Secretary of State, to confiscate 
property blocked pursuant to section 1 and determined to belong to a 
person, organization, or country that had planned, authorized, aided, 
or engaged in armed hostilities against the United States. Section 2 
directed that all right, title, and interest in such confiscated 
property shall vest in the Department of the Treasury, and such vested 
property shall promptly be transferred to the Development Fund for 
Iraq.
    Section 3 of Executive Order 13315 prohibited any transaction by a 
United States person or within the United States that evades or avoids, 
has the purpose of evading or avoiding, or attempts to violate, any of 
the prohibitions set forth in the Order, as well as any conspiracy 
formed to violate such prohibitions. Section 4 defined certain terms 
used in the Order. Section 5 set forth the President's determination 
that the making of donations of the type specified in section 203(b)(2) 
of IEEPA (i.e., donations of articles, such as food, clothing, and 
medicine, intended to be used to relieve human suffering) by or to 
persons determined to be subject to the sanctions would seriously 
impair his ability to deal with the national emergency declared in 
Executive Order 13303 and expanded in scope in this Order and would 
endanger Armed Forces of the United States that were engaged in 
hostilities. Accordingly, the President prohibited the donation of such 
items unless authorized by OFAC.
    On July 29, 2004, the President issued Executive Order 13350, 
which, because of the removal of the regime of Saddam Hussein and other 
developments, terminated the national emergency that had been declared 
in Executive Order 12722 with respect to Iraq, and revoked that Order, 
Executive Order 12724, and subsequent Orders that were based on the 
national emergency declared in Executive Order 12722. In Executive 
Order 13350, the President also took certain additional steps to deal 
with the national emergency declared in Executive Order 13303 and 
expanded in Executive Order 13315, which remains in effect.
    Among other things, the President's termination of the national 
emergency that had been declared in Executive Order 12722 and his 
revocation of that and related Orders ended, as of July 30, 2004, the 
import and export prohibitions that had been imposed pursuant to 
Executive Orders 12722 and 12724 and related regulations, including

[[Page 55465]]

the Iraqi Sanctions Regulations, 31 CFR part 575. As a practical 
matter, most import and export transactions had been authorized by the 
provisions of subpart E of part 575 since May 23, 2003. OFAC has now 
removed the Iraqi Sanctions Regulations from 31 CFR chapter V effective 
September 13, 2010.
    Section 1 of Executive Order 13350 provided for the continuation of 
prohibitions under section 207 of IEEPA, 50 U.S.C. 1706, with regard to 
transactions involving property blocked pursuant to Executive Orders 
12722 and 12724 that continued to be blocked as of July 30, 2004. In 
addition, section 1 provided that the termination of the national 
emergency declared in Executive Order 12722 shall not affect any action 
taken or proceeding pending but not finally concluded or determined as 
of July 30, 2004, any action or proceeding based on any act committed 
prior to such date, or any rights or duties that matured or penalties 
that were incurred prior to such date. Accordingly, property blocked 
pursuant to Executive Orders 12722 and 12724 as of July 30, 2004, 
remained blocked.
    Section 2 replaced and superseded the Annex to Executive Order 
13315 in its entirety with the Annex to Executive Order 13350. Section 
3 amended Executive Order 13290 by substituting the national emergency 
declared in Executive Order 13303 and expanded in Executive Order 13315 
for the one declared in Executive Order 12722. Section 4 prohibited the 
trade in or transfer of ownership or possession of Iraqi cultural 
property or other items of archeological, historical, cultural, rare 
scientific, and religious importance that were illegally removed, or 
for which a reasonable suspicion existed that they were illegally 
removed, from the Iraq National Museum, the National Library, and other 
locations in Iraq since August 6, 1990, unless licensed or authorized 
pursuant to Executive Order 13350 or otherwise consistent with U.S. 
law. Section 5 prohibited the making of donations of the type specified 
in section 203(b)(2) of IEEPA by or to persons determined to be subject 
to the sanctions imposed by Executive Order 13315, as amended by 
Executive Order 13350.
    The President issued Executive Order 13364 on November 29, 2004, 
further modifying the scope of the national emergency that was declared 
in Executive Order 13303, expanded in Executive Order 13315, and 
modified in Executive Order 13350. The President found that the threat 
of attachment or other judicial process against the Central Bank of 
Iraq constituted an obstacle to the orderly reconstruction of Iraq, the 
restoration and maintenance of peace and security in that country, and 
the development of political, administrative, and economic institutions 
in Iraq. Accordingly, Executive Order 13364 amended section 1 of 
Executive Order 13303 to extend that section's protection from 
attachment, judgment, execution, or other judicial process to any 
accounts, assets, investments, or any other property of any kind owned 
by, belonging to, or held by the Central Bank of Iraq, or held or 
otherwise controlled by any financial institution in the name or on 
behalf of, or otherwise for, the Central Bank of Iraq.
    In addition, consistent with UNSCRs 1483 and 1546, dated May 22, 
2003, and June 8, 2004, respectively, Executive Order 13364 amended 
section 1 of Executive Order 13303 to limit the immunity provided 
therein in two ways. First, it provided that the immunity from 
attachment for Iraqi petroleum and petroleum products and interests 
therein shall apply only until title passes to the initial purchaser. 
Second, it restricted the overall prohibition against attachment, 
judgment, execution, or other judicial process so that the immunity 
from attachment shall not apply with respect to any final judgment 
arising out of a contractual obligation entered into by the Government 
of Iraq, including any agency or instrumentality thereof, after June 
30, 2004.
    Finally, on July 17, 2007, the President issued Executive Order 
13438, finding that acts of violence threatening the peace and 
stability of Iraq and undermining efforts to promote economic 
reconstruction and political reform in Iraq and to provide humanitarian 
assistance to the Iraqi people constitute an unusual and extraordinary 
threat to the national security and foreign policy of the United 
States. Accordingly, he determined that it was in the interests of the 
United States to take additional steps with respect to the national 
emergency declared in Executive Order 13303, expanded in Executive 
Order 13315, and relied upon for additional steps in Executive Orders 
13350 and 13364.
    Section 1 of Executive Order 13438 blocked the property and 
interests in property in the United States or in the possession or 
control of United States persons, including any overseas branch, of any 
person determined by the Secretary of the Treasury, in consultation 
with the Secretary of State and the Secretary of Defense: (i) To have 
committed, or to pose a significant risk of committing, an act of 
violence that has the purpose or effect of (A) threatening the peace or 
stability of Iraq or the Government of Iraq, or (B) undermining efforts 
to promote economic reconstruction and political reform in Iraq or to 
provide humanitarian assistance to the Iraqi people; (ii) to have 
materially assisted, sponsored, or provided financial, material, 
logistical, or technical support for, or goods or services in support 
of, such an act or acts of violence or any person whose property and 
interests in property are blocked pursuant to the Order; or (iii) to be 
owned or controlled by or to have acted or purported to act for or on 
behalf of, directly or indirectly, any person whose property and 
interests in property are blocked pursuant to the Order. The 
prohibitions in section 1 include, but are not limited to, the making 
of any contribution or provision of funds, goods, or services by, to, 
or for the benefit of any person whose property and interests in 
property have been blocked, and the receipt of any contribution or 
provision of funds, goods, or services from any such person.
    Acting under authority delegated to the Secretary of the Treasury 
by Executive Orders 13303, 13315, 13350, 13364 and 13438, OFAC is 
promulgating these Iraq Stabilization and Insurgency Sanctions 
Regulations, 31 CFR part 576 (the ``Regulations''), to implement the 
provisions of those orders.
    Subpart A of the Regulations clarifies the relation of this part to 
other laws and regulations. Subpart B of the Regulations sets forth: 
(a) The prohibitions contained in section 1 of Executive Order 13303, 
as amended by Executive Order 13364; (b) the prohibitions contained in 
section 1 of Executive Order 13315, as amended by Executive Order 
13350; (c) the prohibitions contained in sections 1 and 4 of Executive 
Order 13350; and (d) the prohibitions contained in section 1 of 
Executive Order 13438. See Sec. Sec.  576.201, 576.206, 576.208. 
Persons identified in the Annex to Executive Order 13315, as amended by 
Executive Order 13350, or designated by or under the authority of the 
Secretary of the Treasury pursuant to Executive Orders 13315 or 13438 
are referred to throughout the Regulations as ``persons whose property 
and interests in property are blocked pursuant to Sec.  576.201(a).'' 
The names of persons listed in or designated pursuant to Executive 
Orders 13315, 13350, and 13438 are published on OFAC's Specially 
Designated Nationals and Blocked Persons List, which is accessible via 
OFAC's Web site. Those names also are published in the Federal Register 
as they are added to the List, and the entire List is republished

[[Page 55466]]

annually as Appendix A to 31 CFR chapter V.
    Subpart C of the Regulations defines key terms used throughout this 
part. Subpart D of the Regulations sets forth interpretive sections 
regarding other provisions in the Regulations. Section 576.411 of 
subpart D interprets a provision unique to Part 576, Sec.  576.208, 
which provides that the trade in or transfer of certain Iraqi cultural 
property is prohibited. OFAC may establish a violation of Sec.  576.208 
separate from, and independent of, other laws and regulations that 
prohibit the trade in or transfer of Iraqi cultural property. Section 
576.411 states that the mere compliance with certain legal, 
administrative, or procedural requirements, such as those set forth by 
U.S. Customs and Border Protection, does not preclude a violation of 
Sec.  576.208.
    Transactions otherwise prohibited under the Regulations but found 
to be consistent with U.S. policy may be authorized by one of the 
general licenses contained in subpart E of the Regulations or by a 
specific license issued pursuant to the procedures described in subpart 
E of part 501 of 31 CFR chapter V. In addition to the general licenses, 
subpart E of the Regulations also contains certain statements of 
licensing policy. In particular, OFAC may license or authorize, on a 
case-by-case basis, judicial process with regard to property and 
interests in property protected by Sec.  576.206(a) to satisfy 
liability for damages assessed in connection with an ecological 
accident, including an oil spill. See Sec.  576.508. The language in 
Sec.  576.508 derives from UNSCR 1483, which requires all States to 
provide immunity to Iraqi petroleum, petroleum products, and natural 
gas in regard to any form of attachment, garnishment, or execution in 
their respective domestic legal systems, unless the proceeds are needed 
to satisfy liability for damages assessed in connection with an 
ecological accident that occurred after May 22, 2003.
    Subpart F of the Regulations refers to subpart C of part 501 for 
applicable recordkeeping and reporting requirements. Subpart G of the 
Regulations describes the civil and criminal penalties applicable to 
violations of the regulations, as well as the procedures governing the 
potential imposition of a civil monetary penalty. Subpart H of the 
Regulations refers to subpart D of part 501 for applicable provisions 
relating to administrative procedures and sets forth a delegation of 
authorities. Subpart I of the Regulations sets forth a Paperwork 
Reduction Act notice.

Public Participation

    Because the Regulations involve a foreign affairs function, 
Executive Order 12866 and the provisions of the Administrative 
Procedure Act (5 U.S.C. 553) requiring notice of proposed rulemaking, 
opportunity for public participation, and delay in effective date are 
inapplicable. Because no notice of proposed rulemaking is required for 
this rule, the Regulatory Flexibility Act (5 U.S.C. 601-612) does not 
apply.

Paperwork Reduction Act

    The collections of information related to the Regulations are 
contained in 31 CFR part 501 (the ``Reporting, Procedures and Penalties 
Regulations''). Pursuant to the Paperwork Reduction Act of 1995 (44 
U.S.C. 3507), those collections of information have been previously 
approved by the Office of Management and Budget under control number 
1505-0164. An agency may not conduct or sponsor, and a person is not 
required to respond to, a collection of information unless the 
collection of information displays a valid control number.

Sec.  576.101  Relation of this part to other laws and regulations.

    This part is separate from, and independent of, the other parts of 
this chapter, with the exception of part 501 of this chapter, the 
recordkeeping and reporting requirements and license application and 
other procedures of which apply to this part. Actions taken pursuant to 
part 501 of this chapter with respect to the prohibitions contained in 
this part are considered actions taken pursuant to this part. Differing 
foreign policy and national security circumstances may result in 
differing interpretations of similar language among the parts of this 
chapter. No license or authorization contained in or issued pursuant to 
those other parts authorizes any transaction prohibited by this part. 
No license or authorization contained in or issued pursuant to any 
other provision of law or regulation authorizes any transaction 
prohibited by this part. No license or authorization contained in or 
issued pursuant to this part relieves the involved parties from 
complying with any other applicable laws or regulations.

    Note to Sec.  576.101:  The Iraqi Sanctions Regulations, 31 CFR

    (a) All property and interests in property that are in the United

are blocked and may not be transferred, paid, exported, withdrawn, or 
otherwise dealt in:

recognized such transfer.
    (c) Unless otherwise provided, an appropriate license or other 
authorization issued by the Office of Foreign Assets Control before, 
during, or after a transfer shall validate such transfer or make it 
enforceable to the same extent that it would be valid or enforceable

not have reasonable cause to know or suspect, in view of all the facts 
and circumstances known or available to such person, that such transfer 
required a license or authorization issued pursuant to this part and 
was not so licensed or authorized, or, if a license or authorization 
did purport to cover the transfer, that such license or authorization 
had been obtained by misrepresentation of a third party or withholding 
of material facts or was otherwise fraudulently obtained; and
    (3) The person with whom such property is or was held or maintained 
filed with the Office of Foreign Assets Control a report setting forth 
in full the circumstances relating to such transfer promptly upon

or any regulation, ruling, instruction, license, or other direction or 
authorization issued pursuant to this part;
    (ii) Such transfer was not licensed or authorized by the Office of

    Unless otherwise specifically provided, any amendment, 
modification, or revocation of any provision in or appendix to this 
part or chapter or of any order, regulation, ruling, instruction, or

any act done or omitted, or any civil or criminal proceeding commenced 
or pending, prior to such amendment, modification, or revocation. All 
penalties, forfeitures, and liabilities under any such order, 
regulation, ruling, instruction, or license continue and may be 
enforced as if such amendment, modification, or revocation had not been 
made.


Sec.  576.403  Setoffs prohibited.

    A setoff against blocked property (including a blocked account), 
whether by a U.S. bank or other U.S. person, is a prohibited transfer 
under Sec.  576.201 if made after the effective date.


Sec.  576.404  Termination and acquisition of an interest in property.

    (a) Whenever a transaction licensed or authorized by or pursuant to 
this part results in the transfer of property (including any property 
interest) away from a person, such property shall no longer be deemed 
to be property blocked pursuant to Sec.  576.201, unless there exists 
in the property another interest that is blocked pursuant to Sec.  
576.201 or any other part of this chapter, the transfer of which has 
not been effected pursuant to license or other authorization.
    (b) Unless otherwise specifically provided in a license or 
authorization issued pursuant to this part, if property (including any 
property interest) is transferred or attempted to be transferred to a 
person whose property and interests in property are blocked pursuant to 
Sec.  576.201(a), such property shall be deemed to be property in which 
that person has an interest and therefore blocked.
    (c) Unless otherwise provided in a license or authorization issued 
pursuant to this part, Iraqi petroleum and petroleum products shall 
enjoy the protections of Sec.  576.206 until title passes to the

products.


Sec.  576.405  Transactions ordinarily incident to a licensed

not themselves persons whose property and interests in property are

wherever located, including by an overseas branch of an entity located

involving blocked property apply to transactions by any U.S. person in 
a location outside the United States with respect to property held in 
the name of a person whose property and interests in property are

Sec.  576.409  Charitable contributions.

    Unless specifically authorized by the Office of Foreign Assets 
Control pursuant to this part, no charitable contribution of funds, 
goods, services, or technology, including contributions to relieve 
human suffering, such as food, clothing or medicine, may be made by, 
to, or for the benefit of, or received from, a person whose property 
and interests in property are blocked pursuant to Sec.  576.201(a). For 
the purposes of this part, a contribution is made by, to, or for the 
benefit of, or received from, a person whose property and interests in

by, to, or in the name of, or received from or in the name of, an 
entity or individual acting for or on behalf of, or owned or controlled 
by, such a person; or if made in an attempt to violate, to evade, or to 
avoid the bar on the provision of contributions by, to, or for the 
benefit of such a person, or the receipt of contributions from any such 
person.


Sec.  576.410  Credit extended and cards issued by U.S. financial 
institutions.

that section prohibits U.S. financial institutions from performing 
under any existing credit agreements, including, but not limited to, 
charge cards, debit cards, or other credit facilities issued by a U.S. 
financial institution to a person whose property and interests in 
property are blocked pursuant to Sec.  576.201(a).


Sec.  576.411  Prohibited transactions involving certain Iraqi cultural 
property.

    (a) The prohibition on trade in or transfer of ownership or 
possession of certain Iraqi cultural property in Sec.  576.208 is 
separate from, and independent of, other laws and regulations that may 
also prohibit the same conduct.
    (b) The mere compliance with certain legal, administrative, or 
procedural requirements, such as the filing of a U.S. Customs and 
Border Protection Form 3461 (Entry/Immediate Delivery) or U.S. Customs 
and Border Protection Form 7501 (Entry Summary), does not render the 
trade in or transfer of Iraqi cultural property otherwise consistent 
with U.S. law for purposes of Sec.  576.208. The trade in or transfer 
of Iraqi cultural property as described in Sec.  576.208 would violate 
Sec.  576.208 regardless of whether the U.S. Customs and Border 
Protection forms were truthfully and accurately completed.

    Note to Sec.  576.411: Other laws and regulations potentially 
applicable to the unlawful trade in or transfer of Iraqi cultural 
property include, but are not limited to, the transportation of 
stolen goods, 18 U.S.C. 2314; the receipt of stolen goods, 18 U.S.C. 
2315; the importation of goods contrary to law, 18 U.S.C. 545 and 19 
U.S.C. 1595a(a), (b), and (c); the exportation of goods contrary to 
law, 19 U.S.C. 1595a(d); the importation of stolen cultural 
property, 19 U.S.C. 2607; the importation of cultural property 
pertaining to the inventory of a museum or religious or secular 
public monument, 19 CFR 12.104a; and the emergency protection of 
Iraqi cultural antiquities, 19 CFR 12.104j.

Sec.  576.412  Entities owned by a person whose property and interests 
in property are blocked.

    A person whose property and interests in property are blocked 
pursuant to Sec.  576.201(a) has an interest in all property and 
interests in property of an entity in which it owns, directly or 
indirectly, a 50 percent or greater interest. The property and 
interests in property of such an entity, therefore, are blocked, and 
such an entity is a person whose property and interests in property are 
blocked pursuant to Sec.  576.201(a), regardless of whether the entity 
itself is listed in the Annex to Executive Order 13315, as amended, or 
designated pursuant to Sec.  576.201(a)(2) or (3).

Subpart E--Licenses, Authorizations, and Statements of Licensing 
Policy

validates any transaction effected prior to the issuance of such

license or authorization.
    (b) No regulation, ruling, instruction, or license authorizes any 
transaction prohibited under this part unless the regulation, ruling, 
instruction or license is issued by the Office of Foreign Assets 
Control and specifically refers to this part. No regulation, ruling, 
instruction, or license referring to this part shall be deemed to 
authorize any transaction prohibited by any other part of this chapter 
unless the regulation, ruling, instruction, or license specifically 
refers to such part.
    (c) Any regulation, ruling, instruction, or license authorizing any 
transaction otherwise prohibited under this part has the effect of 
removing a prohibition contained in this part from the transaction, but 
only to the extent specifically stated by its terms. Unless the 
regulation, ruling, instruction, or license otherwise specifies, such 
an authorization does not create any right, duty, obligation, claim, or 
interest in, or

[[Page 55473]]

with respect to, any property which would not otherwise exist under 
ordinary principles of law.


Sec.  576.503  Exclusion from licenses.

    The Office of Foreign Assets Control reserves the right to exclude 
any person, property, or transaction from the operation of any license

offices is authorized, provided that no transfer is made from an 
account within the United States to an account held outside the United 
States, and further provided that a transfer from a blocked account may 
be made only to another blocked account held in the same name.

    Note to Sec.  576.504:  See Sec.  501.603 of this chapter for 
mandatory reporting requirements regarding financial transfers. See

a case-by-case basis to authorize the attachment, judgment, decree,

Subpart G--Penalties


Sec.  576.701  Penalties.

    (a) Attention is directed to section 206 of the International 
Emergency Economic Powers Act (50 U.S.C. 1705) (``IEEPA''), which is 
applicable to violations of the provisions of any license, ruling, 
regulation, order, directive, or instruction issued by or pursuant to 
the direction or authorization of the Secretary of the Treasury 
pursuant to this part or otherwise under IEEPA.
    (1) A civil penalty not to exceed the amount set forth in section 
206 of IEEPA may be imposed on any person who violates, attempts to 
violate, conspires to violate, or causes a violation of any license, 
order, or regulation issued under IEEPA.

    Note to paragraph (a)(1) of Sec.  576.701:  As of the date of 
publication in the Federal Register of the final rule adding this 
part to 31 CFR chapter V September 13, 2010, IEEPA provides for a 
maximum civil penalty not to exceed the greater of $250,000 or an 
amount that is twice the amount of the transaction that is the basis 
of the violation with respect to which the penalty is imposed.

    (2) A person who willfully commits, willfully attempts to commit, 
or willfully conspires to commit, or aids or abets in the commission of 
a violation of any license, order, regulation, or prohibition may, upon 
conviction, be fined not more than $1,000,000, or if a natural person, 
may be imprisoned for not more than 20 years, or both.
    (b) Adjustments to penalty amounts. (1) The civil penalties 
provided in IEEPA are subject to adjustment pursuant to the Federal 
Civil Penalties Inflation Adjustment Act of 1990 (Pub. L. 101-410, as 
amended, 28 U.S.C. 2461 note).
    (2) The criminal penalties provided in IEEPA are subject to 
adjustment pursuant to 18 U.S.C. 3571.
    (c) Attention is also directed to 18 U.S.C. 1001, which provides 
that whoever, in any matter within the jurisdiction of the executive, 
legislative, or judicial branch of the Government of the United States, 
knowingly and willfully falsifies, conceals, or covers up by any trick, 
scheme, or device a material fact; makes any materially false, 
fictitious, or fraudulent statement or representation; or makes or uses 
any false writing or document knowing the same to contain any 
materially false, fictitious, or fraudulent statement or entry shall be 
fined under title 18, United States Code, imprisoned, or both.
    (d) Violations of this part may also be subject to relevant 
provisions of other applicable laws.


Sec.  576.702  Pre-Penalty Notice; settlement.

    (a) When required. If the Office of Foreign Assets Control has 
reason to believe that there has occurred a violation of any provision 
of this part or a violation of the provisions of any license, ruling, 
regulation, order, direction, or instruction issued by or pursuant to 
the direction or authorization of the Secretary of the Treasury 
pursuant to this part or otherwise under IEEPA and determines that a 
civil monetary penalty is warranted, the Office of Foreign Assets 
Control will issue a Pre-Penalty Notice informing the alleged violator 
of the agency's intent to impose a monetary penalty. A Pre-Penalty 
Notice shall be in writing. The Pre-Penalty Notice may be issued 
whether or not another agency has taken any action with respect to the 
matter. For a description of the contents of a Pre-Penalty Notice, see 
Appendix A to part 501 of this chapter.
    (b)(1) Right to respond. An alleged violator has the right to 
respond to a Pre-Penalty Notice by making a written presentation to the 
Office of Foreign Assets Control. For a description of the information 
that should be included in such a response, see Appendix A to part 501 
of this chapter.
    (2) Deadline for response. A response to a Pre-Penalty Notice must 
be made within the applicable 30-day period set forth in this 
paragraph. The failure to submit a response within the applicable time 
period set forth in this paragraph shall be deemed to be a waiver of 
the right to respond.
    (i) Computation of time for response. A response to a Pre-Penalty 
Notice must be postmarked or date-stamped by the U.S. Postal Service 
(or foreign postal service, if mailed abroad) or courier service 
provider (if transmitted to the Office of Foreign Assets Control by 
courier) on or before the 30th day after the postmark date on the 
envelope in which the Pre-Penalty Notice was mailed. If the Pre-Penalty 
Notice was personally delivered by a non-U.S. Postal Service agent 
authorized by the Office of Foreign Assets Control, a response must be 
postmarked or date-stamped on or before the 30th day after the date of 
delivery.
    (ii) Extensions of time for response. If a due date falls on a 
Federal holiday or weekend, that due date is extended to include the 
following business day. Any other extensions of time will be granted, 
at the discretion of the Office of Foreign Assets Control, only upon 
specific request to the Office of Foreign Assets Control.
    (3) Form and method of response. A response to a Pre-Penalty Notice 
need not be in any particular form, but it must be typewritten and 
signed by the alleged violator or a representative thereof, must 
contain information sufficient to indicate that it is in response to 
the Pre-Penalty Notice, and must include the Office of Foreign Assets 
Control identification number listed on the Pre-Penalty Notice. A copy 
of the written response may be sent by facsimile, but the original also 
must be sent to the Office of Foreign Assets Control Civil Penalties 
Division by mail or courier and must be postmarked or date-stamped in 
accordance with paragraph (b)(2) of this section.
    (c) Settlement. Settlement discussion may be initiated by the 
Office of Foreign Assets Control, the alleged violator, or the alleged 
violator's authorized representative. For a description of practices 
with respect to settlement, see Appendix A to part 501 of this chapter.
    (d) Guidelines. Guidelines for the imposition or settlement of 
civil penalties by the Office of Foreign Assets Control are contained 
in Appendix A to part 501 of this chapter.
    (e) Representation. A representative of the alleged violator may 
act on behalf of the alleged violator, but any oral communication with 
the Office of Foreign Assets Control prior to a written submission 
regarding the specific allegations contained in the Pre-Penalty

[[Page 55475]]

Notice must be preceded by a written letter of representation, unless 
the Pre-Penalty Notice was served upon the alleged violator in care of 
the representative.


Sec.  576.703  Penalty imposition.

    If, after considering any written response to the Pre-Penalty 
Notice and any relevant facts, the Office of Foreign Assets Control 
determines that there was a violation by the alleged violator named in 
the Pre-Penalty Notice and that a civil monetary penalty is 
appropriate, the Office of Foreign Assets Control may issue a Penalty 
Notice to the violator containing a determination of the violation and 
the imposition of the monetary penalty. For additional details 
concerning issuance of a Penalty Notice, see Appendix A to part 501 of 
this chapter. The issuance of the Penalty Notice shall constitute final 
agency action. The violator has the right to seek judicial review of 
that final agency action in federal district court.


Sec.  576.704  Administrative collection; referral to United States 
Department of Justice.

    In the event that the violator does not pay the penalty imposed 
pursuant to this part or make payment arrangements acceptable to the 
Office of Foreign Assets Control, the matter may be referred for 
administrative collection measures by the Department of the Treasury or 
to the United States Department of Justice for appropriate action to 
recover the penalty in a civil suit in a federal district court.
