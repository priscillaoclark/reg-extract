FEDERAL RESERVE SYSTEM

12 CFR Part 226

[Docket No. R-1843]
RIN 7100-AG 84

CONSUMER FINANCIAL PROTECTION BUREAU

12 CFR Part 1026


Truth in Lending (Regulation Z)

AGENCY: Board of Governors of the Federal Reserve System (Board) and 
Consumer Financial Protection Bureau (CFPB).

ACTION: Final rules, official interpretations.

-----------------------------------------------------------------------

SUMMARY: The Board and the CFPB (collectively, Agencies) are publishing 
final rules amending the official interpretations for the Agencies' 
regulations that implement the Truth in Lending Act (TILA). The Dodd-
Frank Wall Street Reform and Consumer Protection Act (Dodd-Frank Act) 
amended TILA by requiring that the dollar threshold for exempt consumer 
credit transactions be adjusted annually by the annual percentage 
increase in the Consumer Price Index for Urban Wage Earners and 
Clerical Workers (CPI-W). Based on the annual percentage increase in 
the CPI-W as of June 1, 2024, the exemption threshold will increase 
from $69,500 to $71,900 effective January 1, 2025. Because the Dodd-
Frank Act also requires similar adjustments in the Consumer Leasing 
Act's threshold for exempt consumer leases, the Agencies are making 
similar amendments to each of their respective regulations implementing 
the Consumer Leasing Act elsewhere in the Rules section of this issue 
of the Federal Register.

DATES: This final rule is effective January 1, 2025.

I. Background

    The Dodd-Frank Act increased the threshold in TILA for exempt 
consumer credit transactions,\1\ and the threshold in the Consumer 
Leasing Act (CLA) for exempt consumer leases, from $25,000 to $50,000, 
effective July 21, 2011.\2\ In addition, the Dodd-Frank Act requires 
that, on and after December 31, 2011, these thresholds be adjusted 
annually for inflation by the annual percentage increase in the CPI-W, 
as published by the Bureau of Labor Statistics.\3\ In April 2011, the 
Board issued a final rule amending Regulation Z (which implements TILA) 
consistent with these provisions of the Dodd-Frank Act, along with a 
similar final rule amending Regulation M (which implements the CLA) 
(collectively, Board Final Threshold Rules).\4\
---------------------------------------------------------------------------

    \1\ Although consumer credit transactions above the threshold 
are generally exempt, loans secured by real property or by personal 
property used or expected to be used as the principal dwelling of a 
consumer and private education loans are covered by TILA regardless 
of the loan amount. See 12 CFR 226.3(b)(1)(i) (Board) and 12 CFR 
1026.3(b)(1)(i) (CFPB).

---------------------------------------------------------------------------

    Title X of the Dodd-Frank Act transferred rulemaking authority for 
a number of consumer financial protection laws from the Board to the 
CFPB, effective July 21, 2011. In connection with this transfer of 
rulemaking authority, the CFPB issued its own Regulation Z implementing 
TILA, 12 CFR part 1026, substantially duplicating the Board's 
Regulation Z.\5\ Although the CFPB has the authority to issue rules to 
implement TILA for most entities, the Board retains authority to issue 
rules under TILA for certain motor vehicle dealers covered by section 
1029(a) of the Dodd-Frank Act, and the Board's Regulation Z continues 
to apply to those entities.\6\
---------------------------------------------------------------------------

    \6\ Section 1029(a) of the Dodd-Frank Act states: ``Except as 
permitted in subsection (b), the Bureau may not exercise any 
rulemaking, supervisory, enforcement, or any other authority . . . 
over a motor vehicle dealer that is predominantly engaged in the 
sale and servicing of motor vehicles, the leasing and servicing of 
motor vehicles, or both.'' 12 U.S.C. 5519(a). Section 1029(b) of the 
Dodd-Frank Act provides that ``[s]ubsection (a) shall not apply to 
any person, to the extent that such person--(1) provides consumers 
with any services related to residential or commercial mortgages or 
self-financing transactions involving real property; (2) operates a 
line of business--(A) that involves the extension of retail credit 
or retail leases involving motor vehicles; and (B) in which--(i) the 
extension of retail credit or retail leases are provided directly to 
consumers; and (ii) the contract governing such extension of retail 
credit or retail leases is not routinely assigned to an unaffiliated 
third party finance or leasing source; or (3) offers or provides a 
consumer financial product or service not involving or related to 
the sale, financing, leasing, rental, repair, refurbishment, 
maintenance, or other servicing of motor vehicles, motor vehicle 
parts, or any related or ancillary product or service.'' 12 U.S.C. 
5519(b).
---------------------------------------------------------------------------

    The Agencies' regulations,\7\ and their accompanying official 
interpretations, provide that the exemption threshold will be adjusted 
annually effective January 1 of each year based on any annual 
percentage increase in the CPI-W that was in effect on the preceding 
June 1. They further provide that any increase in the threshold amount 
will be rounded to the nearest $100 increment. For example, if the 
annual percentage increase in the CPI-W would result in a $950 increase 
in the threshold amount, the threshold amount will be increased by 
$1,000. However, if the annual percentage increase in the CPI-W would 
result in a $949 increase in the threshold amount, the threshold amount 
will be increased by $900.\8\ Since 2011, the Agencies have adjusted 
the Regulation Z exemption threshold annually, in accordance with these 
rules.

1026.
---------------------------------------------------------------------------

    On November 30, 2016, the Agencies published a final rule in the 
Federal Register to memorialize the calculation method used by the 
Agencies each year to adjust the exemption threshold to ensure that, as 
contemplated by section 1100E(b) of the Dodd-Frank Act, the values for 
the exemption threshold keep pace with the CPI-W (Regulation Z 
Adjustment Calculation Rule).\9\ The Regulation Z Adjustment 
Calculation Rule memorialized the policy that, if there is no annual 
percentage increase in the CPI-W, the Agencies will not adjust the 
exemption threshold from the prior year. The Regulation Z Adjustment 
Calculation Rule also provided that, in years following a year in which 
the exemption threshold was not adjusted because there was a decrease 
in the CPI-W from the previous year, the threshold is calculated by 
applying the annual percentage change in the CPI-W to the dollar amount 
that would have resulted, after rounding, if the decreases and any 
subsequent increases in the CPI-W had been taken into account. If the 
resulting amount calculated, after rounding, is greater than the 
current threshold, then the threshold effective January 1 the following 
year will increase accordingly; if the resulting amount calculated, 
after rounding, is equal to or less than the current threshold, then 
the threshold effective January 1 the following year will not change, 
but future increases will be calculated based on the amount that would 
have resulted, after rounding.
---------------------------------------------------------------------------

    \9\ See 81 FR 86260 (Nov. 30, 2016).
---------------------------------------------------------------------------

II. 2025 Adjustment and Official Interpretations Revision

    Effective January 1, 2025, the exemption threshold amount is 
increased from $69,500 to $71,900. This amount is based on the CPI-W in 
effect on June 1, 2024, which was reported on May 15, 2024 (based on 
April 2024 data).\10\ The CPI-W is a subset of the CPI-U index (based 
on all urban consumers) and represents approximately 30 percent of the 
U.S. population. The CPI-W reported on May 15, 2024, reflects a 3.4 
percent increase in the CPI-W from April 2023 to April 2024. 
Accordingly, the 3.4 percent increase in the CPI-W from April 2023 to 
April 2024 results in an exemption threshold amount of $71,900, after 
rounding. The Agencies are revising the official interpretations to 
their respective regulations to add new comment 3(b)-3.xvi to state 
that, from January 1, 2025, through December 31, 2025, the threshold 
amount is $71,900. These revisions are effective January 1, 2025.
---------------------------------------------------------------------------

    \10\ The Bureau of Labor Statistics calculates consumer-based 
indices for each month but does not report those indices until the 
middle of the following month. As such, the most recently reported 
indices as of June 1, 2024, were reported on May 15, 2024, and 
reflect economic conditions in April 2024.
---------------------------------------------------------------------------

III. Regulatory Analysis

Administrative Procedure Act

    Under the Administrative Procedure Act, notice and opportunity for 
public comment are not required if the Agencies find that notice and 
public comment are impracticable, unnecessary, or contrary to the 
public interest.\11\ The amendments in this rule are technical and 
apply the method previously set forth in the Board Final Threshold 
Rules and the Regulation Z Adjustment Calculation Rule. For these 
reasons, the Agencies have determined that publishing a notice of 
proposed rulemaking and providing opportunity for public comment are 
unnecessary. Therefore, the amendments are adopted in final form.
---------------------------------------------------------------------------

    \11\ 5 U.S.C. 553(b)(B).
---------------------------------------------------------------------------

Regulatory Flexibility Act

    The Regulatory Flexibility Act (RFA) does not apply to a rulemaking 
where a general notice of proposed rulemaking is not required.\12\ As 
noted previously,

[[Page 82940]]

the Agencies have determined that it is unnecessary to publish a 
general notice of proposed rulemaking for this joint final rule. 
Accordingly, the RFA's requirements relating to an initial and final 
regulatory flexibility analysis do not apply.
---------------------------------------------------------------------------

    \12\ 5 U.S.C. 603(a), 604(a).
---------------------------------------------------------------------------

Paperwork Reduction Act

    The Agencies reviewed this final rule in accordance with the 
Paperwork Reduction Act of 1995.\13\ The Agencies have determined that 
this rule does not create any new information collections or 
substantially revise any existing collections.

BOARD OF GOVERNORS OF THE FEDERAL RESERVE SYSTEM

Authority and Issuance

    For the reasons set forth in the preamble, the Board amends 
Regulation Z, 12 CFR part 226, as set forth below:

PART 226--TRUTH IN LENDING (REGULATION Z)

1. The authority citation for part 226 continues to read as follows:

    Authority:  12 U.S.C. 3806; 15 U.S.C. 1604, 1637(c)(5), 1639(l) 
and 1639h; Pub. L. 111-24, section 2, 123 Stat. 1734; Pub. L. 111-

2. In supplement I to part 226, under Section 226.3--Exempt 
Transactions, revise 3(b) Credit over applicable threshold amount, to 
read as follows:

Supplement I to Part 226--Official Staff Interpretations

* * * * *

Section 226.3--Exempt Transactions

* * * * *
    3(b) Credit over applicable threshold amount.
    1. Threshold amount. For purposes of Sec.  226.3(b), the 
threshold amount in effect during a particular period is the amount 
stated in comment 3(b)-3 for that period. The threshold amount is 
adjusted effective January 1 of each year by any annual percentage 
increase in the Consumer Price Index for Urban Wage Earners and 
Clerical Workers (CPI-W) that was in effect on the preceding June 1. 
Comment 3(b)-3 will be amended to provide the threshold amount for 
the upcoming year after the annual percentage change in the CPI-W 
that was in effect on June 1 becomes available. Any increase in the 
threshold amount will be rounded to the nearest $100 increment. For 
example, if the annual percentage increase in the CPI-W would result 
in a $950 increase in the threshold amount, the threshold amount 
will be increased by $1,000. However, if the annual percentage 
increase in the CPI-W would result in a $949 increase in the 
threshold amount, the threshold amount will be increased by $900.
    2. No increase in the CPI-W. If the CPI-W in effect on June 1 
does not increase from the CPI-W in effect on June 1 of the previous 
year, the threshold amount effective the following January 1 through 
December 31 will not change from the previous year. When this 
occurs, for the years that follow, the threshold is calculated based 
on the annual percentage change in the CPI-W applied to the dollar 
amount that would have resulted, after rounding, if decreases and 
any subsequent increases in the CPI-W had been taken into account.
    i. Net increases. If the resulting amount calculated, after 
rounding, is greater than the current threshold, then the threshold 
effective January 1 the following year will increase accordingly.
    ii. Net decreases. If the resulting amount calculated, after 
rounding, is equal to or less than the current threshold, then the 
threshold effective January 1 the following year will not change, 
but future increases will be calculated based on the amount that 
would have resulted.
    3. Threshold. For purposes of Sec.  226.3(b), the threshold 
amount in effect during a particular period is the amount stated in 
the following for that period.
    i. Prior to July 21, 2011, the threshold amount is $25,000.
    ii. From July 21, 2011, through December 31, 2011, the threshold 
amount is $50,000.
    iii. From January 1, 2012, through December 31, 2012, the 
threshold amount is $51,800.
    iv. From January 1, 2013, through December 31, 2013, the 
threshold amount is $53,000.
    v. From January 1, 2014, through December 31, 2014, the 
threshold amount is $53,500.
    vi. From January 1, 2015, through December 31, 2015, the 
threshold amount is $54,600.
    vii. From January 1, 2016, through December 31, 2016, the 
threshold amount is $54,600.
    viii. From January 1, 2017, through December 31, 2017, the 
threshold amount is $54,600.
    ix. From January 1, 2018, through December 31, 2018, the 
threshold amount is $55,800.
    x. From January 1, 2019, through December 31, 2019, the 
threshold amount is $57,200.
    xi. From January 1, 2020, through December 31, 2020, the 
threshold amount is $58,300.
    xii. From January 1, 2021, through December 31, 2021, the 
threshold amount is $58,300.
    xiii. From January 1, 2022, through December 31, 2022, the 
threshold amount is $61,000.
    xiv. From January 1, 2023, through December 31, 2023, the 
threshold amount is $66,400.
    xv. From January 1, 2024, through December 31, 2024, the 
threshold amount is $69,500.
    xvi. From January 1, 2025, through December 31, 2025, the 
threshold amount is $71,900.
    4. Open-end credit.
    i. Qualifying for exemption. An open-end account is exempt under 
Sec.  226.3(b) (unless secured by any real property, or by personal 
property used or expected to be used as the consumer's principal 
dwelling) if either of the following conditions is met:
    A. The creditor makes an initial extension of credit at or after 
account opening that exceeds the threshold amount in effect at the 
time the initial extension is made. If a creditor makes an initial 
extension of credit after account opening that does not exceed the 
threshold amount in effect at the time the extension is made, the 
creditor must have satisfied all of the applicable requirements of 
this part from the date the account was opened (or earlier, if 
applicable), including but not limited to the requirements of Sec.  
226.6 (account-opening disclosures), Sec.  226.7 (periodic 
statements), Sec.  226.52 (limitations on fees), and Sec.  226.55 
(limitations on increasing annual percentages rates, fees, and 
charges). For example:
    (1) Assume that the threshold amount in effect on January 1 is 
$50,000. On February 1, an account is opened but the creditor does 
not make an initial extension of credit at that time. On July 1, the 
creditor makes an initial extension of credit of $60,000. In this 
circumstance, no requirements of this part apply to the account.
    (2) Assume that the threshold amount in effect on January 1 is 
$50,000. On February 1, an account is opened but the creditor does 
not make an initial extension of credit at that time. On July 1, the 
creditor makes an initial extension of credit of $50,000 or less. In 
this circumstance, the account is not exempt, and the creditor must 
have satisfied all of the applicable requirements of this part from 
the date the account was opened (or earlier, if applicable).
    B. The creditor makes a firm written commitment at account 
opening to extend a total amount of credit in excess of the 
threshold amount in effect at the time the

[[Page 82941]]

account is opened with no requirement of additional credit 
information for any advances on the account (except as permitted 
from time to time with respect to open-end accounts pursuant to 
Sec.  226.2(a)(20)).
    ii. Subsequent changes generally. Subsequent changes to an open-
end account or the threshold amount may result in the account no 
longer qualifying for the exemption in Sec.  226.3(b). In these 
circumstances, the creditor must begin to comply with all of the 
applicable requirements of this part within a reasonable period of 
time after the account ceases to be exempt. Once an account ceases 
to be exempt, the requirements of this part apply to any balances on 
the account. The creditor, however, is not required to comply with 
the requirements of this part with respect to the period of time 
during which the account was exempt. For example, if an open-end 
credit account ceases to be exempt, the creditor must within a 
reasonable period of time provide the disclosures required by Sec.  
226.6 reflecting the current terms of the account and begin to 
provide periodic statements consistent with Sec.  226.7. However, 
the creditor is not required to disclose fees or charges imposed 
while the account was exempt. Furthermore, if the creditor provided 
disclosures consistent with the requirements of this part while the 
account was exempt, it is not required to provide disclosures 
required by Sec.  226.6 reflecting the current terms of the account. 
See also comment 3(b)-6.
    iii. Subsequent changes when exemption is based on initial 
extension of credit. If a creditor makes an initial extension of 
credit that exceeds the threshold amount in effect at that time, the 
open-end account remains exempt under Sec.  226.3(b) regardless of a 
subsequent increase in the threshold amount, including an increase 
pursuant to Sec.  226.3(b)(1)(ii) as a result of an increase in the 
CPI-W. Furthermore, in these circumstances, the account remains 
exempt even if there are no further extensions of credit, subsequent 
extensions of credit do not exceed the threshold amount, the account 
balance is subsequently reduced below the threshold amount (such as 
through repayment of the extension), or the credit limit for the 
account is subsequently reduced below the threshold amount. However, 
if the initial extension of credit on an account does not exceed the 
threshold amount in effect at the time of the extension, the account 
is not exempt under Sec.  226.3(b) even if a subsequent extension 
exceeds the threshold amount or if the account balance later exceeds 
the threshold amount (for example, due to the subsequent accrual of 
interest).
    iv. Subsequent changes when exemption is based on firm 
commitment.
    A. General. If a creditor makes a firm written commitment at 
account opening to extend a total amount of credit that exceeds the 
threshold amount in effect at that time, the open-end account 
remains exempt under Sec.  226.3(b) regardless of a subsequent 
increase in the threshold amount pursuant to Sec.  226.3(b)(1)(ii) 
as a result of an increase in the CPI-W. However, see comment 3(b)-8 
with respect to the increase in the threshold amount from $25,000 to 
$50,000. If an open-end account is exempt under Sec.  226.3(b) based 
on a firm commitment to extend credit, the account remains exempt 
even if the amount of credit actually extended does not exceed the 
threshold amount. In contrast, if the firm commitment does not 
exceed the threshold amount at account opening, the account is not 
exempt under Sec.  226.3(b) even if the account balance later 
exceeds the threshold amount. In addition, if a creditor reduces a 
firm commitment, the account ceases to be exempt unless the reduced 
firm commitment exceeds the threshold amount in effect at the time 
of the reduction. For example:
    (1) Assume that, at account opening in year one, the threshold 
amount in effect is $50,000 and the account is exempt under Sec.  
226.3(b) based on the creditor's firm commitment to extend $55,000 
in credit. If during year one the creditor reduces its firm 
commitment to $53,000, the account remains exempt under Sec.  
226.3(b). However, if during year one the creditor reduces its firm 
commitment to $40,000, the account is no longer exempt under Sec.  
226.3(b).
    (2) Assume that, at account opening in year one, the threshold 
amount in effect is $50,000 and the account is exempt under Sec.  
226.3(b) based on the creditor's firm commitment to extend $55,000 
in credit. If the threshold amount is $56,000 on January 1 of year 
six as a result of increases in the CPI-W, the account remains 
exempt. However, if the creditor reduces its firm commitment to 
$54,000 on July 1 of year six, the account ceases to be exempt under 
Sec.  226.3(b).
    B. Initial extension of credit. If an open-end account qualifies 
for a Sec.  226.3(b) exemption at account opening based on a firm 
commitment, that account may also subsequently qualify for a Sec.  
226.3(b) exemption based on an initial extension of credit. However, 
that initial extension must be a single advance in excess of the 
threshold amount in effect at the time the extension is made. In 
addition, the account must continue to qualify for an exemption 
based on the firm commitment until the initial extension of credit 
is made. For example:
    (1) Assume that, at account opening in year one, the threshold 
amount in effect is $50,000 and the account is exempt under Sec.  
226.3(b) based on the creditor's firm commitment to extend $55,000 
in credit. The account is not used for an extension of credit during 
year one. On January 1 of year two, the threshold amount is 
increased to $51,000 pursuant to Sec.  226.3(b)(1)(ii) as a result 
of an increase in the CPI-W. On July 1 of year two, the consumer 
uses the account for an initial extension of $52,000. As a result of 
this extension of credit, the account remains exempt under Sec.  
226.3(b) even if, after July 1 of year two, the creditor reduces the 
firm commitment to $51,000 or less.
    (2) Same facts as in paragraph 4.iv.B(1) of this section except 
that the consumer uses the account for an initial extension of 
$30,000 on July 1 of year two and for an extension of $22,000 on 
July 15 of year two. In these circumstances, the account is not 
exempt under Sec.  226.3(b) based on the $30,000 initial extension 
of credit because that extension did not exceed the applicable 
threshold amount ($51,000), although the account remains exempt 
based on the firm commitment to extend $55,000 in credit.
    (3) Same facts as in paragraph 4.iv.B(1) of this section except 
that, on April 1 of year two, the creditor reduces the firm 
commitment to $50,000, which is below the $51,000 threshold then in 
effect. Because the account ceases to qualify for a Sec.  226.3(b) 
exemption on April 1 of year two, the account does not qualify for a 
Sec.  226.3(b) exemption based on a $52,000 initial extension of 
credit on July 1 of year two.
    5. Closed-end credit.
    i. Qualifying for exemption. A closed-end loan is exempt under 
Sec.  226.3(b) (unless the extension of credit is secured by any 
real property, or by personal property used or expected to be used 
as the consumer's principal dwelling; or is a private education loan 
as defined in Sec.  226.46(b)(5)), if either of the following 
conditions is met.
    A. The creditor makes an extension of credit at consummation 
that exceeds the threshold amount in effect at the time of 
consummation. In these circumstances, the loan remains exempt under 
Sec.  226.3(b) even if the amount owed is subsequently reduced below 
the threshold amount (such as through repayment of the loan).
    B. The creditor makes a commitment at consummation to extend a 
total amount of credit in excess of the threshold amount in effect 
at the time of consummation. In these circumstances, the loan 
remains exempt under Sec.  226.3(b) even if the total amount of 
credit extended does not exceed the threshold amount.
    ii. Subsequent changes. If a creditor makes a closed-end 
extension of credit or commitment to extend closed-end credit that 
exceeds the threshold amount in effect at the time of consummation, 
the closed-end loan remains exempt under Sec.  226.3(b) regardless 
of a subsequent increase in the threshold amount. However, a closed-
end loan is not exempt under Sec.  226.3(b) merely because it is 
used to satisfy and replace an existing exempt loan, unless the new 
extension of credit is itself exempt under the applicable threshold 
amount. For example, assume a closed-end loan that qualified for a 
Sec.  226.3(b) exemption at consummation in year one is refinanced 
in year ten and that the new loan amount is less than the threshold 
amount in effect in year ten. In these circumstances, the creditor 
must comply with all of the applicable requirements of this part 
with respect to the year ten transaction if the original loan is 
satisfied and replaced by the new loan, which is not exempt under 
Sec.  226.3(b). See also comment 3(b)-6.
    6. Addition of a security interest in real property or a 
dwelling after account opening or consummation.
    i. Open-end credit. For open-end accounts, if, after account 
opening, a security interest is taken in real property, or in 
personal property used or expected to be used as the consumer's 
principal dwelling, a previously exempt account ceases to be exempt 
under Sec.  226.3(b) and the creditor must begin to comply with all 
of the applicable requirements of this part within a reasonable 
period of time. See comment 3(b)-4.ii. If a security interest is 
taken in the consumer's principal dwelling, the creditor must also

[[Page 82942]]

give the consumer the right to rescind the security interest 
consistent with Sec.  226.15.
    ii. Closed-end credit. For closed-end loans, if, after 
consummation, a security interest is taken in any real property, or 
in personal property used or expected to be used as the consumer's 
principal dwelling, an exempt loan remains exempt under Sec.  
226.3(b). However, the addition of a security interest in the 
consumer's principal dwelling is a transaction for purposes of Sec.  
226.23, and the creditor must give the consumer the right to rescind 
the security interest consistent with that section. See Sec.  
226.23(a)(1) and the accompanying commentary. In contrast, if a 
closed-end loan that is exempt under Sec.  226.3(b) is satisfied and 
replaced by a loan that is secured by any real property, or by 
personal property used or expected to be used as the consumer's 
principal dwelling, the new loan is not exempt under Sec.  226.3(b) 
and the creditor must comply with all of the applicable requirements 
of this part. See comment 3(b)-5.
    7. Application to extensions secured by mobile homes. Because a 
mobile home can be a dwelling under Sec.  226.2(a)(19), the 
exemption in Sec.  226.3(b) does not apply to a credit extension 
secured by a mobile home that is used or expected to be used as the 
principal dwelling of the consumer. See comment 3(b)-6.
    8. Transition rule for open-end accounts exempt prior to July 
21, 2011. Section 226.3(b)(2) applies only to open-end accounts 
opened prior to July 21, 2011. Section 226.3(b)(2) does not apply if 
a security interest is taken by the creditor in any real property, 
or in personal property used or expected to be used as the 
consumer's principal dwelling. If, on July 20, 2011, an open-end 
account is exempt under Sec.  226.3(b) based on a firm commitment to 
extend credit in excess of $25,000, the account remains exempt under 
Sec.  226.3(b)(2) until December 31, 2011 (unless the firm 
commitment is reduced to $25,000 or less). If the firm commitment is 
increased on or before December 31, 2011, to an amount in excess of 
$50,000, the account remains exempt under Sec.  226.3(b)(1) 
regardless of subsequent increases in the threshold amount as a 
result of increases in the CPI-W. If the firm commitment is not 
increased on or before December 31, 2011, to an amount in excess of 
$50,000, the account ceases to be exempt under Sec.  226.3(b) based 
on a firm commitment to extend credit. For example:
    i. Assume that, on July 20, 2011, the account is exempt under 
Sec.  226.3(b) based on the creditor's firm commitment to extend 
$30,000 in credit. On November 1, 2011, the creditor increases the 
firm commitment on the account to $55,000. In these circumstances, 
the account remains exempt under Sec.  226.3(b)(1) regardless of 
subsequent increases in the threshold amount as a result of 
increases in the CPI-W.
    ii. Same facts as paragraph 8.i. of this section except, on 
November 1, 2011, the creditor increases the firm commitment on the 
account to $40,000. In these circumstances, the account ceases to be 
exempt under Sec.  226.3(b)(2) after December 31, 2011, and the 
creditor must begin to comply with the applicable requirements of 
this part.

Supplement I to Part 1026--Official Interpretations

* * * * *

Section 1026.3--Exempt Transactions

* * * * *

3(b) Credit Over Applicable Threshold Amount

    1. Threshold amount. For purposes of Sec.  1026.3(b), the 
threshold amount in effect during a particular period is the amount 
stated in comment 3(b)-3 for that period. The threshold amount is 
adjusted effective January 1 of each year by any annual percentage 
increase in the Consumer Price Index for Urban Wage Earners and 
Clerical Workers (CPI-W) that was in effect on the preceding June 1. 
Comment 3(b)-3 will be amended to provide the threshold amount for 
the upcoming year after the annual percentage change in the CPI-W 
that was in effect on June 1 becomes available. Any increase in the 
threshold amount will be rounded to the nearest $100 increment. For 
example, if the annual percentage increase in the CPI-W would result 
in a $950 increase in the threshold amount, the threshold amount 
will be increased by $1,000. However, if the annual percentage 
increase in the CPI-W would result in a $949 increase in the 
threshold amount, the threshold amount will be increased by $900.
    2. No increase in the CPI-W. If the CPI-W in effect on June 1 
does not increase from the CPI-W in effect on June 1 of the previous 
year, the threshold amount effective the following January 1 through 
December 31 will not change from the previous year. When this 
occurs, for the years that follow, the threshold is calculated based 
on the annual percentage change in the CPI-W applied to the dollar 
amount that would have resulted, after rounding, if decreases and 
any subsequent increases in the CPI-W had been taken into account.
    i. Net increases. If the resulting amount calculated, after 
rounding, is greater than the current threshold, then the threshold 
effective January 1 the following year will increase accordingly.
    ii. Net decreases. If the resulting amount calculated, after 
rounding, is equal to or less than the current threshold, then the 
threshold effective January 1 the following year will not change, 
but future increases will be calculated based on the amount that 
would have resulted.
    3. Threshold. For purposes of Sec.  1026.3(b), the threshold 
amount in effect during a particular period is the amount stated in 
the following for that period.
    i. Prior to July 21, 2011, the threshold amount is $25,000.
    ii. From July 21, 2011, through December 31, 2011, the threshold 
amount is $50,000.
    iii. From January 1, 2012, through December 31, 2012, the 
threshold amount is $51,800.
    iv. From January 1, 2013, through December 31, 2013, the 
threshold amount is $53,000.
    v. From January 1, 2014, through December 31, 2014, the 
threshold amount is $53,500.
    vi. From January 1, 2015, through December 31, 2015, the 
threshold amount is $54,600.
    vii. From January 1, 2016, through December 31, 2016, the 
threshold amount is $54,600.
    viii. From January 1, 2017, through December 31, 2017, the 
threshold amount is $54,600.
    ix. From January 1, 2018, through December 31, 2018, the 
threshold amount is $55,800.
    x. From January 1, 2019, through December 31, 2019, the 
threshold amount is $57,200.
    xi. From January 1, 2020, through December 31, 2020, the 
threshold amount is $58,300.
    xii. From January 1, 2021, through December 31, 2021, the 
threshold amount is $58,300. xiii. From January 1, 2022, through 
December 31, 2022, the threshold amount is $61,000.
    xiv. From January 1, 2023, through December 31, 2023, the 
threshold amount is $66,400.
    xv. From January 1, 2024, through December 31, 2024, the 
threshold amount is $69,500.
    xvi. From January 1, 2025, through December 31, 2025, the 
threshold amount is $71,900.
    4. Open-end credit.
    i. Qualifying for exemption. An open-end account is exempt under 
Sec.  1026.3(b) (unless secured by real property, or by personal 
property used or expected to be used as the consumer's principal 
dwelling) if either of the following conditions is met:
    A. The creditor makes an initial extension of credit at or after 
account opening that exceeds the threshold amount in effect at the 
time the initial extension is made. If a creditor makes an initial 
extension of credit after account opening that does not exceed the 
threshold amount in effect at the time the extension is made, the 
creditor must have satisfied all of the applicable requirements of 
this part from the date the account was opened (or earlier, if 
applicable), including but not limited to the requirements of Sec.  
1026.6 (account-opening disclosures),

[[Page 82943]]

Sec.  1026.7 (periodic statements), Sec.  1026.52 (limitations on 
fees), and Sec.  1026.55 (limitations on increasing annual 
percentage rates, fees, and charges). For example:
    1. Assume that the threshold amount in effect on January 1 is 
$50,000. On February 1, an account is opened but the creditor does 
not make an initial extension of credit at that time. On July 1, the 
creditor makes an initial extension of credit of $60,000. In this 
circumstance, no requirements of this part apply to the account.
    2. Assume that the threshold amount in effect on January 1 is 
$50,000. On February 1, an account is opened but the creditor does 
not make an initial extension of credit at that time. On July 1, the 
creditor makes an initial extension of credit of $50,000 or less. In 
this circumstance, the account is not exempt, and the creditor must 
have satisfied all of the applicable requirements of this part from 
the date the account was opened (or earlier, if applicable).
    B. The creditor makes a firm written commitment at account 
opening to extend a total amount of credit in excess of the 
threshold amount in effect at the time the account is opened with no 
requirement of additional credit information for any advances on the 
account (except as permitted from time to time with respect to open-
end accounts pursuant to Sec.  1026.2(a)(20)).
    ii. Subsequent changes generally. Subsequent changes to an open-
end account or the threshold amount may result in the account no 
longer qualifying for the exemption in Sec.  1026.3(b). In these 
circumstances, the creditor must begin to comply with all of the 
applicable requirements of this part within a reasonable period of 
time after the account ceases to be exempt. Once an account ceases 
to be exempt, the requirements of this part apply to any balances on 
the account. The creditor, however, is not required to comply with 
the requirements of this part with respect to the period of time 
during which the account was exempt. For example, if an open-end 
credit account ceases to be exempt, the creditor must within a 
reasonable period of time provide the disclosures required by Sec.  
1026.6 reflecting the current terms of the account and begin to 
provide periodic statements consistent with Sec.  1026.7. However, 
the creditor is not required to disclose fees or charges imposed 
while the account was exempt. Furthermore, if the creditor provided 
disclosures consistent with the requirements of this part while the 
account was exempt, it is not required to provide disclosures 
required by Sec.  1026.6 reflecting the current terms of the 
account. See also comment 3(b)-6.
    iii. Subsequent changes when exemption is based on initial 
extension of credit. If a creditor makes an initial extension of 
credit that exceeds the threshold amount in effect at that time, the 
open-end account remains exempt under Sec.  1026.3(b) regardless of 
a subsequent increase in the threshold amount, including an increase 
pursuant to Sec.  1026.3(b)(1)(ii) as a result of an increase in the 
CPI-W. Furthermore, in these circumstances, the account remains 
exempt even if there are no further extensions of credit, subsequent 
extensions of credit do not exceed the threshold amount, the account 
balance is subsequently reduced below the threshold amount (such as 
through repayment of the extension), or the credit limit for the 
account is subsequently reduced below the threshold amount. However, 
if the initial extension of credit on an account does not exceed the 
threshold amount in effect at the time of the extension, the account 
is not exempt under Sec.  1026.3(b) even if a subsequent extension 
exceeds the threshold amount or if the account balance later exceeds 
the threshold amount (for example, due to the subsequent accrual of 
interest).
    iv. Subsequent changes when exemption is based on firm 
commitment.
    A. General. If a creditor makes a firm written commitment at 
account opening to extend a total amount of credit that exceeds the 
threshold amount in effect at that time, the open-end account 
remains exempt under Sec.  1026.3(b) regardless of a subsequent 
increase in the threshold amount pursuant to Sec.  1026.3(b)(1)(ii) 
as a result of an increase in the CPI-W. However, see comment 3(b)-8 
with respect to the increase in the threshold amount from $25,000 to 
$50,000. If an open-end account is exempt under Sec.  1026.3(b) 
based on a firm commitment to extend credit, the account remains 
exempt even if the amount of credit actually extended does not 
exceed the threshold amount. In contrast, if the firm commitment 
does not exceed the threshold amount at account opening, the account 
is not exempt under Sec.  1026.3(b) even if the account balance 
later exceeds the threshold amount. In addition, if a creditor 
reduces a firm commitment, the account ceases to be exempt unless 
the reduced firm commitment exceeds the threshold amount in effect 
at the time of the reduction. For example:
    1. Assume that, at account opening in year one, the threshold 
amount in effect is $50,000 and the account is exempt under Sec.  
1026.3(b) based on the creditor's firm commitment to extend $55,000 
in credit. If during year one the creditor reduces its firm 
commitment to $53,000, the account remains exempt under Sec.  
1026.3(b). However, if during year one the creditor reduces its firm 
commitment to $40,000, the account is no longer exempt under Sec.  
1026.3(b).
    2. Assume that, at account opening in year one, the threshold 
amount in effect is $50,000 and the account is exempt under Sec.  
1026.3(b) based on the creditor's firm commitment to extend $55,000 
in credit. If the threshold amount is $56,000 on January 1 of year 
six as a result of increases in the CPI-W, the account remains 
exempt. However, if the creditor reduces its firm commitment to 
$54,000 on July 1 of year six, the account ceases to be exempt under 
Sec.  1026.3(b).
    B. Initial extension of credit. If an open-end account qualifies 
for a Sec.  1026.3(b) exemption at account opening based on a firm 
commitment, that account may also subsequently qualify for a Sec.  
1026.3(b) exemption based on an initial extension of credit. 
However, that initial extension must be a single advance in excess 
of the threshold amount in effect at the time the extension is made. 
In addition, the account must continue to qualify for an exemption 
based on the firm commitment until the initial extension of credit 
is made. For example:
    1. Assume that, at account opening in year one, the threshold 
amount in effect is $50,000 and the account is exempt under Sec.  
1026.3(b) based on the creditor's firm commitment to extend $55,000 
in credit. The account is not used for an extension of credit during 
year one. On January 1 of year two, the threshold amount is 
increased to $51,000 pursuant to Sec.  1026.3(b)(1)(ii) as a result 
of an increase in the CPI-W. On July 1 of year two, the consumer 
uses the account for an initial extension of $52,000. As a result of 
this extension of credit, the account remains exempt under Sec.  
1026.3(b) even if, after July 1 of year two, the creditor reduces 
the firm commitment to $51,000 or less.
    2. Same facts as in paragraph 4.iv.B.1 of this section except 
that the consumer uses the account for an initial extension of 
$30,000 on July 1 of year two and for an extension of $22,000 on 
July 15 of year two. In these circumstances, the account is not 
exempt under Sec.  1026.3(b) based on the $30,000 initial extension 
of credit because that extension did not exceed the applicable 
threshold amount ($51,000), although the account remains exempt 
based on the firm commitment to extend $55,000 in credit.
    3. Same facts as in paragraph 4.iv.B.1 of this section except 
that, on April 1 of year two, the creditor reduces the firm 
commitment to $50,000, which is below the $51,000 threshold then in 
effect. Because the account ceases to qualify for a Sec.  1026.3(b) 
exemption on April 1 of year two, the account does not qualify for a 
Sec.  1026.3(b) exemption based on a $52,000 initial extension of 
credit on July 1 of year two.
    5. Closed-end credit.
    i. Qualifying for exemption. A closed-end loan is exempt under 
Sec.  1026.3(b) (unless the extension of credit is secured by real 
property, or by personal property used or expected to be used as the 
consumer's principal dwelling; or is a private education loan as 
defined in Sec.  1026.46(b)(5)), if either of the following 
conditions is met:
    A. The creditor makes an extension of credit at consummation 
that exceeds the threshold amount in effect at the time of 
consummation. In these circumstances, the loan remains exempt under 
Sec.  1026.3(b) even if the amount owed is subsequently reduced 
below the threshold amount (such as through repayment of the loan).
    B. The creditor makes a commitment at consummation to extend a 
total amount of credit in excess of the threshold amount in effect 
at the time of consummation. In these circumstances, the loan 
remains exempt under Sec.  1026.3(b) even if the total amount of 
credit extended does not exceed the threshold amount.
    ii. Subsequent changes. If a creditor makes a closed-end 
extension of credit or commitment to extend closed-end credit that 
exceeds the threshold amount in effect at the time of consummation, 
the closed-end loan remains exempt under Sec.  1026.3(b) regardless 
of a subsequent increase in the threshold amount. However, a closed-
end loan is not exempt under Sec.  1026.3(b) merely because it is 
used to satisfy and replace an existing exempt loan, unless the new 
extension of

[[Page 82944]]

credit is itself exempt under the applicable threshold amount. For 
example, assume a closed-end loan that qualified for a Sec.  
1026.3(b) exemption at consummation in year one is refinanced in 
year ten and that the new loan amount is less than the threshold 
amount in effect in year ten. In these circumstances, the creditor 
must comply with all of the applicable requirements of this part 
with respect to the year ten transaction if the original loan is 
satisfied and replaced by the new loan, which is not exempt under 
Sec.  1026.3(b). See also comment 3(b)-6.
    6. Addition of a security interest in real property or a 
dwelling after account opening or consummation.
    i. Open-end credit. For open-end accounts, if after account 
opening a security interest is taken in real property, or in 
personal property used or expected to be used as the consumer's 
principal dwelling, a previously exempt account ceases to be exempt 
under Sec.  1026.3(b) and the creditor must begin to comply with all 
of the applicable requirements of this part within a reasonable 
period of time. See comment 3(b)-4.ii. If a security interest is 
taken in the consumer's principal dwelling, the creditor must also 
give the consumer the right to rescind the security interest 
consistent with Sec.  1026.15.
    ii. Closed-end credit. For closed-end loans, if after 
consummation a security interest is taken in real property, or in 
personal property used or expected to be used as the consumer's 
principal dwelling, an exempt loan remains exempt under Sec.  
1026.3(b). However, the addition of a security interest in the 
consumer's principal dwelling is a transaction for purposes of Sec.  
1026.23, and the creditor must give the consumer the right to 
rescind the security interest consistent with that section. See 
Sec.  1026.23(a)(1) and its commentary. In contrast, if a closed-end 
loan that is exempt under Sec.  1026.3(b) is satisfied and replaced 
by a loan that is secured by real property, or by personal property 
used or expected to be used as the consumer's principal dwelling, 
the new loan is not exempt under Sec.  1026.3(b), and the creditor 
must comply with all of the applicable requirements of this part. 
See comment 3(b)-5.
    7. Application to extensions secured by mobile homes. Because a 
mobile home can be a dwelling under Sec.  1026.2(a)(19), the 
exemption in Sec.  1026.3(b) does not apply to a credit extension 
secured by a mobile home that is used or expected to be used as the 
principal dwelling of the consumer. See comment 3(b)-6.
    8. Transition rule for open-end accounts exempt prior to July 
21, 2011. Section 1026.3(b)(2) applies only to open-end accounts 
opened prior to July 21, 2011. Section 1026.3(b)(2) does not apply 
if a security interest is taken by the creditor in real property, or 
in personal property used or expected to be used as the consumer's 
principal dwelling. If, on July 20, 2011, an open-end account is 
exempt under Sec.  1026.3(b) based on a firm commitment to extend 
credit in excess of $25,000, the account remains exempt under Sec.  
1026.3(b)(2) until December 31, 2011 (unless the firm commitment is 
reduced to $25,000 or less). If the firm commitment is increased on 
or before December 31, 2011, to an amount in excess of $50,000, the 
account remains exempt under Sec.  1026.3(b)(1) regardless of 
subsequent increases in the threshold amount as a result of 
increases in the CPI-W. If the firm commitment is not increased on 
or before December 31, 2011, to an amount in excess of $50,000, the 
account ceases to be exempt under Sec.  1026.3(b) based on a firm 
commitment to extend credit. For example:
    i. Assume that, on July 20, 2011, the account is exempt under 
Sec.  1026.3(b) based on the creditor's firm commitment to extend 
$30,000 in credit. On November 1, 2011, the creditor increases the 
firm commitment on the account to $55,000. In these circumstances, 
the account remains exempt under Sec.  1026.3(b)(1) regardless of 
subsequent increases in the threshold amount as a result of 
increases in the CPI-W.
    ii. Same facts as paragraph 8.i of this section except, on 
November 1, 2011, the creditor increases the firm commitment on the 
account to $40,000. In these circumstances, the account ceases to be 
exempt under Sec.  1026.3(b)(2) after December 31, 2011, and the 
creditor must begin to comply with the applicable requirements of 
this part.
