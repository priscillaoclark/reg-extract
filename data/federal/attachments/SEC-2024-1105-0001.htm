    Pursuant to the provisions of Section 19(b)(1) of the Securities 
Exchange Act of 1934 (``Act'') \1\ and Rule 19b-4 thereunder,\2\ notice 
is hereby given that on July 31, 2024, Miami International Securities 
Exchange, LLC (``MIAX'' or ``Exchange'') filed with the Securities and 
Exchange Commission (``Commission'') a proposed rule change as 
described in Items I, II, and III below, which Items have been prepared 
by the Exchange. The Commission is publishing this notice to solicit 
comments on the proposed rule change from interested persons.
---------------------------------------------------------------------------

    \1\ 15 U.S.C. 78s(b)(1).
    \2\ 17 CFR 240.19b-4.
---------------------------------------------------------------------------

I. Self-Regulatory Organization's Statement of the Terms of Substance 
of the Proposed Rule Change

    The Exchange is filing a proposal to amend the MIAX Fee Schedule 
(``Fee Schedule'').
    The text of the proposed rule change is available on the Exchange's 
website at <a href="https://www.miaxglobal.com/markets/us-options/all-options-exchanges/rule-filings">https://www.miaxglobal.com/markets/us-options/all-options-exchanges/rule-filings</a>, at MIAX's principal office, and at the 
Commission's Public Reference Room.

II. Self-Regulatory Organization's Statement of the Purpose of, and 
Statutory Basis for, the Proposed Rule Change

    In its filing with the Commission, the Exchange included statements 
concerning the purpose of and basis for the proposed rule change and 
discussed any comments it received on the proposed rule change. The 
text of these statements may be examined at the places specified in 
Item IV below. The Exchange has prepared summaries, set forth in 
sections A, B, and C below, of the most significant aspects of such 
statements.

A. Self-Regulatory Organization's Statement of the Purpose of, and 
Statutory Basis for, the Proposed Rule Change

1. Purpose
    The Exchange proposes to amend the exchange grouping of options 
exchanges within the routing fee table in Section (1)(c) of the Fee 
Schedule, Fees for Customer Orders Routed to Another Options Exchange, 
to reflect the recent addition of a new national securities exchange, 
MIAX Sapphire, LLC (``MIAX Sapphire''),\3\ to be listed in the routing 
fee table. The Exchange proposes to implement the fee change effective 
August 1, 2024.
---------------------------------------------------------------------------

    \3\ See Securities Exchange Act Release No. 100539 (July 15, 
2024), 89 FR 58848 (July 19, 2024) (File No. 10-240) (order 
approving application of MIAX Sapphire, LLC for registration as a 
national securities exchange).
---------------------------------------------------------------------------

Background
    Currently, the Exchange assesses routing fees based upon (i) the 
origin type of the order; (ii) whether or not it is an order for 
standard option classes in the Penny Interval Program \4\ (``Penny 
classes'') or an order for standard option classes which are not in the 
Penny Interval Program (``Non-Penny classes'') (or other explicitly 
identified classes); and (iii) to which away market it is being routed. 
This assessment practice is identical to the routing fees assessment 
practice currently utilized by the Exchange's affiliates, MIAX PEARL, 
LLC (``MIAX Pearl'') and MIAX Emerald, LLC (``MIAX Emerald''). This is 
also similar to the methodology utilized by the Cboe BZX Exchange, Inc. 
(``Cboe BZX Options''), a competing options exchange, in assessing 
routing fees. Cboe BZX Options has exchange groupings in its fee 
schedule, similar to those of the Exchange, whereby several exchanges 
are grouped into the same category dependent upon the order's origin 
type and whether it is a Penny or Non-Penny class.\5\
---------------------------------------------------------------------------

    \4\ See Exchange Rule 510(c).
    \5\ See Cboe U.S. Options Fee Schedules, BZX Options, effective 
July 15, 2024, ``Fee Codes and Associated Fees,'' at <a href="https://www.cboe.com/us/options/membership/fee_schedule/bzx/">https://www.cboe.com/us/options/membership/fee_schedule/bzx/</a>.
---------------------------------------------------------------------------

    As a result of the anticipated launch of MIAX Sapphire in the third 
quarter of 2024, the Exchange has determined to amend the exchange 
groupings of options exchanges within the routing fee table to include 
MIAX Sapphire and the anticipated associated costs of routing customer 
orders to MIAX Sapphire for execution.
    The impact of this proposed change will be increased routing 
options for Members.\6\ The Exchange notes that routing through the 
Exchange is optional and that Members will continue to be able to 
choose where to route applicable Member orders. Under

[[Page 66472]]

this proposed change, the Exchange will not amend the fees associated 
with the exchange groupings. This proposal merely seeks to add MIAX 
Sapphire to the exchange groupings as described in the routing fee 
table below.
---------------------------------------------------------------------------

    \6\ The term ``Member'' means an individual or organization 
approved to exercise the trading rights associated with a Trading 
Permit. Members are deemed ``members'' under the Exchange Act. See 
Exchange Rule 100.
---------------------------------------------------------------------------

    According, with the proposed change, the routing fee table will be 
as follows:

------------------------------------------------------------------------
                          Description                              Fees

------------------------------------------------------------------------

    In determining to amend its routing fee table to determine which 
category MIAX Sapphire belongs to the Exchange took into account 
anticipated transaction fees and rebates assessed by the away markets 
to which the Exchange routes orders, as well as the Exchange's clearing 
costs, administrative, regulatory, and technical costs associated with 
routing orders to an away market. The Exchange uses unaffiliated 
routing brokers to route orders to the away markets; the costs 
associated with the use of these services are included in the routing 
fees specified in the Fee Schedule. This routing fees structure is not 
only similar to the Exchange's affiliates, MIAX Pearl and MIAX Emerald, 
but is also comparable to the structure in place at Cboe BZX 
Options,\7\ a competing options exchange. The Exchange's routing fee 
structure approximates the Exchange's costs associated with routing 
orders to away markets. The per-contract transaction fee amount 
associated with each grouping closely approximates the Exchange's all-
in cost (plus an additional, non-material amount) \8\ to execute that 
corresponding contract(s) at that corresponding exchange. The Exchange 
notes that in determining whether to include certain exchanges in a 
certain groupings of options exchanges in the routing fee table, the 
Exchange considered the transaction fees and rebates assessed by away 
markets, and determined to amend the grouping of exchanges that assess 
transaction fees for routed orders within a similar range. This same 
logic and structure applies to all of the groupings in the routing fee 
table. By utilizing the same structure that is utilized by the 
Exchange's affiliates, MIAX Pearl and MIAX Emerald, the Exchange's 
Members will be assessed routing fees in a similar manner. The Exchange 
believes that this structure will minimize any confusion as to the 
method of assessing routing fees between the three exchanges. The 
Exchange notes that its affiliates, MIAX Pearl and MIAX Emerald, will 
file to make the same proposed routing fee changes contained herein.
---------------------------------------------------------------------------

    \7\ The Cboe BZX Options fee schedule is similar to the 
Exchange's Fee Schedule in that it has exchange groupings, whereby 
several exchanges are grouped into the same category. See supra note 
5.
    \8\ This amount is to cover de minimis differences/changes to 
away market fees (i.e., minor increases or decreases) that would not 
necessitate a fee filing by the Exchange to re-categorize the away 
exchange into a different grouping. Routing fees are not intended to 
be a profit center for the Exchange and the Exchange's target 
regarding routing fees and expenses is to be as close as possible to 
net neutral.
---------------------------------------------------------------------------

2. Statutory Basis
    The Exchange believes that its proposal to amend its Fee Schedule 
is consistent with Section 6(b) of the Act \9\ in general, and furthers 
the objectives of Section 6(b)(4) of the Act \10\ in particular, in 
that it is an equitable allocation of reasonable dues, fees, and other 
charges among its members and issuers and other persons using its 
facilities. The Exchange also believes the proposal furthers the 
objectives of Section 6(b)(5) of the Act \11\ in that it is designed to 
promote just and equitable principles of trade, to remove impediments 
to and perfect the mechanism of a free and open market and a national 
market system, and, in general to protect investors and the public 
interest and is not designed to permit unfair discrimination between 
customers, issuers, brokers and dealers.
---------------------------------------------------------------------------

    \9\ 15 U.S.C. 78f(b).
    \10\ 15 U.S.C. 78f(b)(4).
    \11\ 15 U.S.C. 78f(b)(5).
---------------------------------------------------------------------------

    The Exchange believes the proposed change to add MIAX Sapphire to 
the exchange groupings of options exchanges within the routing fee 
table furthers the objectives of Section 6(b)(4) of the Act and is 
reasonable, equitable and not unfairly discriminatory because the 
proposed change will continue to apply in the same manner to all 
Members that are subject to routing fees. The Exchange believes the 
proposed change to add MIAX Sapphire to the routing fee table of 
exchange groupings furthers the objectives of Section 6(b)(5) of the 
Act and is designed to promote just and equitable principles of trade 
and is not unfairly discriminatory because the proposed change seeks to 
recoup costs that will be incurred by the Exchange when routing 
customer orders to MIAX Sapphire on behalf of Members and does so in 
the same manner to all Members that are subject to routing fees. The 
costs to the Exchange to route orders to away markets for execution 
primarily includes transaction fees and rebates assessed by the away 
markets to which the Exchange routes orders, in addition to the 
Exchange's clearing costs, administrative, regulatory and technical 
costs. The Exchange believes that the proposed addition of MIAX 
Sapphire to the exchange groupings would increase the routing options 
available to Members. The per-contract transaction fee amount 
associated with each grouping approximates the Exchange's all-in cost 
(plus an

[[Page 66473]]

additional, non-material amount) to execute the corresponding contract 
at the corresponding exchange.
    The Exchange believes that the proposed rule change is equitable 
and not unfairly discriminatory because all Members' orders in Penny 
classes and Non-Penny classes routed to MIAX Sapphire will be uniformly 
assessed the corresponding fee.

B. Self-Regulatory Organization's Statement on Burden on Competition

    The Exchange does not believe that the proposed rule change will 
impose any burden on competition not necessary or appropriate in 
furtherance of the purposes of the Act. The Exchange does not believe 
the proposed rule change to add MIAX Sapphire to the routing fee table 
will impose any burden on intramarket competition. Rather, the Exchange 
believes that the proposal will promote competition by increasing the 
available away markets to which Members can route orders to.

C. Self-Regulatory Organization's Statement on Comments on the Proposed 
Rule Change Received From Members, Participants, or Others

    Written comments were neither solicited nor received.

III. Date of Effectiveness of the Proposed Rule Change and Timing for 
Commission Action

    The foregoing rule change has become effective pursuant to Section 
19(b)(3)(A)(ii) of the Act,\12\ and Rule 19b-4(f)(2) \13\ thereunder. 
At any time within 60 days of the filing of the proposed rule change, 
the Commission summarily may temporarily suspend such rule change if it 
appears to the Commission that such action is necessary or appropriate 
in the public interest, for the protection of investors, or otherwise 
in furtherance of the purposes of the Act. If the Commission takes such 
action, the Commission shall institute proceedings to determine whether 
the proposed rule should be approved or disapproved.
