I. Self-Regulatory Organization's Statement of the Terms of Substance 
of the Proposed Rule Change

    The Exchange proposes to amend Exchange Rule 2615(d) regarding the 
Contingent Open performed on the Exchange's equity trading platform 
(referred to herein as ``MIAX Pearl Equities'').
    The text of the proposed rule change is available on the Exchange's 
website at <a href="https://www.miaxglobal.com/markets/us-equities/pearl-equities/rule-filings">https://www.miaxglobal.com/markets/us-equities/pearl-equities/rule-filings</a>, at MIAX Pearl's principal office, and at the 
Commission's Public Reference Room.

II. Self-Regulatory Organization's Statement of the Purpose of, and 
Statutory Basis for, the Proposed Rule Change

    In its filing with the Commission, the Exchange included statements 
concerning the purpose of and basis for the proposed rule change and 
discussed any comments it received on the

[[Page 88690]]

proposed rule change. The text of these statements may be examined at 
the places specified in Item IV below. The Exchange has prepared 
summaries, set forth in sections A, B, and C below, of the most 
significant aspects of such statements.

A. Self-Regulatory Organization's Statement of the Purpose of, and 
Statutory Basis for, the Proposed Rule Change

1. Purpose
    The Exchange proposes to amend Exchange Rule 2615(d) regarding the 
Contingent Open performed on MIAX Pearl Equities. In sum, the Exchange 
proposes to amend Exchange Rule 2615(d) to no longer provide for a 
Contingent Open at 9:45 a.m. Eastern Time. As amended, Exchange Rule 
2615(d) would instead provide that the Exchange would perform its 
Opening Process after the security begins trading on the primary 
listing market at any time during the trading day. The Exchange also 
proposes to make a corresponding change to remove a reference to the 
Contingent Open in the definition of Regular Trading Session in 
Exchange Rule 1901. These changes are described in more detail below.
Background
    Exchange Rule 2615 sets forth the Exchange's Opening Process and 
Contingent Open. Each trading day, the Exchange begins trading in an 
equities security by performing its Opening Process after the start of 
Regular Trading Hours \3\ by matching eligible buy and sell orders at 
the midpoint of the National Best Bid and Offer (``NBBO''),\4\ as 
described below. Prior to the beginning of Regular Trading Hours,\5\ 
Users \6\ who wish to participate in the Opening Process may enter 
orders to buy or sell that are designated as Regular Trading Hours Only 
(``RHO'').\7\ Pursuant to Exchange Rule 2615(a), only orders that 
include a time-in-force of RHO may participate in the Opening Process. 
Orders designated as Post Only,\8\ Intermarket Sweep Orders, 
(``ISOs''),\9\ include a Minimum Execution Quantity instruction,\10\ 
and orders that include a time-in-force other than RHO are not eligible 
to participate in the Opening Process. Market Orders \11\ may include a 
time-in-force of Immediate-or-Cancel (``IOC''),\12\ and are, therefore, 
not eligible to participate in the Opening Process. Meanwhile, Limit 
Orders,\13\ Primary Peg Orders,\14\ and Midpoint Peg Orders \15\ that 
include a time-in-force of RHO are eligible to participate in the 
Opening Process. All Self-Trade-Protection (``STP'') modifiers, as 
described in Exchange Rule 2614(f), are honored during the Opening 
Process.
---------------------------------------------------------------------------

    \3\ The term ``Regular Trading Hours'' means ``the time between 
9:30 a.m. and 4:00 p.m. Eastern Time.'' See Exchange Rule 1901.
    \4\ The term ``NBBO'' means ``the national best bid and offer.'' 
See Exchange Rule 1901.
    \5\ According to Exchange Rule 2600(a), Users may begin to enter 
orders starting at 7:30 a.m. Eastern Time.
    \6\ The term ``User'' means ``any Member or Sponsored 
Participant who is authorized to obtain access to the System 
pursuant to Exchange Rule 2602.'' See Exchange Rule 1901.
    \7\ Exchange Rule 2614(b)(2).
    \8\ Exchange Rule 2614(c)(2).
    \9\ Exchange Rule 2614(d).
    \10\ Exchange Rule 2614(c)(7).
    \11\ Exchange Rule 2614(a)(2).
    \12\ Exchange Rule 2614(b)(1). Market Orders may include a time-
in-force of RHO solely when coupled with the PAC routing option for 
purposes of routing away to participate in the primary listing 
market's opening or re-opening process and will continue to not be 
eligible to participate in the Exchange's Opening Process. See 
Exchange Rule 2617(b)(5)(ii).
    \13\ Exchange Rule 2614(a)(1).
    \14\ Exchange Rule 2614(a)(3)(i)(B) [sic].
    \15\ Exchange Rule 2614(a)(3)(i)(A) [sic].
---------------------------------------------------------------------------

    Exchange Rule 2615(b) provides that during the Opening Process, the 
Exchange attempts to match eligible buy and sell orders at the midpoint 
of the NBBO. All orders eligible to trade at the midpoint are processed 
in time sequence, beginning with the order with the oldest timestamp. 
The Opening Process concludes when no remaining orders, if any, can be 
matched at the midpoint of the NBBO. At the conclusion of the Opening 
Process, the unexecuted portion of orders that were eligible to 
participate in the Opening Process are placed on the MIAX PEARL 
Equities Book \16\ in time sequence, cancelled, executed, or routed to 
away Trading Centers \17\ in accordance with the terms of the order.
---------------------------------------------------------------------------

    \16\ The term ``MIAX Pearl Equities Book'' means the electronic 
book of orders in equity securities maintained by the System. See 
Exchange Rule 1901.
    \17\ The term ``Trading Center'' has the same meaning as in Rule 
600(b)(82) of Regulation NMS. See Exchange Rule 100.
---------------------------------------------------------------------------

    Pursuant to Exchange Rule 2615(c), the Exchange calculates the 
midpoint of the NBBO as follows. When the primary listing exchange is 
the New York Stock Exchange LLC (``NYSE'') or NYSE American LLC (``NYSE 
American''), the Opening Process is priced at the midpoint of the: (i) 
first NBBO subsequent to the first reported trade and first two-sided 
quotation on the primary listing exchange after 9:30:00 a.m. Eastern 
Time; or (ii) then prevailing NBBO when the first two-sided quotation 
is published by the primary listing exchange after 9:30:00 a.m. Eastern 
Time, but before 9:45:00 a.m. Eastern Time if no first trade is 
reported by the primary listing exchange within one second of 
publication of the first two-sided quotation by the primary listing 
exchange. For any other primary listing exchange, such as The Nasdaq 
Stock Market LLC (``Nasdaq''), NYSE Arca, LLC (``NYSE Arca''), and Cboe 
BZX Exchange, Inc. (``Cboe BZX''), the Opening Process is priced at the 
midpoint of the first NBBO subsequent to the first two-sided quotation 
published by the primary listing exchange after 9:30:00 a.m. Eastern 
Time.
    Exchange Rule 2615(d) describes the Contingent Open and provides 
that if the conditions to establish the price of the Opening Process 
described above do not occur by 9:45:00 a.m. Eastern Time, the Exchange 
will conduct a Contingent Open and match all orders eligible to 
participate in the Opening Process at the midpoint of the then 
prevailing NBBO. Exchange Rule 2615(d) further provides that if the 
midpoint of the NBBO is not available for the Contingent Open, all 
orders are handled in time sequence, beginning with the order with the 
oldest timestamp, and are placed on the MIAX PEARL Equities Book, 
cancelled, executed, or routed to away Trading Centers in accordance 
with the terms of the order.
Proposed Change
    The Exchange proposes to amend Exchange Rule 2615(d) to no longer 
provide for a Contingent Open at 9:45 a.m. Eastern Time. Instead, the 
Exchange would not open trading in an equity security until that equity 
security began trading on the primary listing market and the conditions 
to establish the opening price set forth under Exchange Rule 2615(c) 
described above occur. At such time, the Exchange will perform its 
Opening Process and match all eligible orders at the midpoint of the 
NBBO, if any, and feed any unexecuted orders onto the MIAX Pearl 
Equities Book in time sequence, as described above. The Opening Process 
may occur anytime during Regular Trading Hours, including at or after 
9:45 a.m. Eastern Time.
    The Exchange initially adopted the Contingent Open under Exchange 
Rule 2615(d) as part of its proposal to adopt rules governing the 
trading of equity securities on MIAX Pearl Equities.\18\ The initial 
intent was to align Exchange Rule 2615 with similar rules and 
functionality available on other equities exchanges. The other 
exchanges on

[[Page 88691]]

which the Exchange based Rule 2615(d) are non-primary listing exchanges 
that, unlike the Exchange, offer an early trading session.\19\ The 
Exchange currently only offers a Regular Trading Session.\20\ Normally, 
an early trading session ends and a regular trading session begins when 
a security is opened for trading on that market. On a non-primary 
listing market like on which the Exchange based its Rules, this 
requires the security is to be [sic] open for trading on the primary 
listing market. Where a security has not begun to trade on the primary 
listing market, a Contingent Open serves an important purpose of 
prescribing an end to the early trading session and beginning of the 
regular trading session on that non-primary listing exchange. A 
Contingent Open allows a non-primary listing exchange that provides an 
early trading session to transition to a regular trading session in a 
timely manner where a security has not opened for trading on the 
primary listing market.\21\
---------------------------------------------------------------------------

    \18\ See Securities Exchange Act Release No. 89563 (August 14, 
2020), 85 FR 51510 (August 20, 2020) (SR-PEARL-2020-03) (adopting 
rules for MIAX Pearl Equities including Exchange Rule 2615(d)).
    \19\ See, e.g., Cboe EDGX Exchange Rules 11.1(a)(1) and 11.7(d), 
and Cboe EDGA Exchange, Inc. Rules 11.1(a)(1) and 11.7(d).
    \20\ The term ``Regular Trading Session'' means ``the time 
between the completion of the Opening Process or Contingent Open as 
defined in Exchange Rule 2615 and 4:00 p.m. Eastern Time.'' See 
Exchange Rule 1901.
    \21\ See, e.g., Securities Exchange Act Release Nos. 72676 (July 
25, 2014), 79 FR 44520 (July 31, 2014) (Notice); and 73468 (October 
29, 2014), 79 FR 65450 (November 4, 2014) SR-EDGX-2014-18 (Notice of 
Filing of Amendment Nos. 1 and 3 and Order Granting Accelerated 
Approval of a Proposed Rule Change, as Modified by Amendment Nos. 1 
and 3, To Amend EDGX Rule 1.5 and Chapter XI Regarding Current 
System Functionality Including the Operation of Order Types and 
Order Instructions) (SR-EDGX-2014-18).
---------------------------------------------------------------------------

    The Exchange currently does not offer an early trading session and, 
therefore, the Contingent Open does not serve as a transition from an 
early trading session to a regular trading session. A Contingent Open 
simply allows the Exchange to trade a security when that security has 
not yet opened on the primary listing market. Once open on the primary 
listing market, the market for that security may be more robust and the 
security is likely trading at prices that more closely resemble its 
value due to that security having been subject to the primary listing 
market's opening auction process. Therefore, in the absence of an early 
trading session, the Exchange believes it is not necessary for it 
perform a Contingent Open at 9:45 a.m. Eastern Time. Instead, the 
Exchange believes it is appropriate for it to wait for a security to be 
trading on the primary listing market before it also begins to trade 
that security. The Exchange believes this could result in eligible 
orders being matched in the Opening Process at a midpoint of the NBBO 
that better reflects the security's trading characteristics and value.
    In the Exchange's experience, most securities are open by 9:45:00 
a.m. Eastern Time and the Exchange performs its Opening Process and is 
trading practically the entire market. However, at times, a security 
may not open by 9:45:00 a.m. This is common in less liquid securities. 
In these cases, the Exchange would not begin to trade a security if and 
until that security opens for trading on the primary listing 
market.\22\
---------------------------------------------------------------------------

    \22\ Should the Exchange seek to adopt an early trading session 
in the future, it anticipates that it would also seek to readopt a 
Contingent Opening Process at that time to set a time at which a 
security would transition from the early to regular trading sessions 
where it has not begun trading on the primary listing market. The 
Exchange will submit a filing with the Commission pursuant to 
Section 19(b)(1) should it decide to adopt an early trading session 
in the future.
---------------------------------------------------------------------------

    As a result of the proposed changes, Exchange Rule 2615(d) would be 
amended to no longer provide for a Contingent Open. Instead, Exchange 
Rule 2615(d) would provide that ``[t]he Exchange will perform the 
Opening Process at any time during Regular Trading Hours when the 
conditions to establish the price of the Opening Process set forth 
under paragraph (c) [of Exchange Rule 2615] occur.''
    Lastly, the Exchange proposes to make a corresponding change to 
remove a reference to the Contingent Open in the definition of Regular 
Trading Session in Exchange Rule 1901. Currently, the term ``Regular 
Trading Session'' shall mean the time between the completion of the 
Opening Process or Contingent Open as defined in Exchange Rule 2615 and 
4:00 p.m. Eastern Time. The Exchange proposes to remove the reference 
to the Contingent Open so that the Regular Trading Session would now be 
from the time of the completion of the Opening Process as defined in 
Exchange Rule 2615 and 4:00 p.m. Eastern Time.
Implementation
    The Exchange will implement the proposed changes to Exchange Rule 
2615(d) on the effective date of this proposed rule change. The 
Exchange will issue a Regulatory Alert announcing the exact 
implementation date of this proposal.
2. Statutory Basis
    The proposed rule change is consistent with Section 6(b) of the 
Act,\23\ in general, and furthers the objectives of Section 
6(b)(5),\24\ in particular, because it is designed to promote just and 
equitable principles of trade, and to remove impediments to and perfect 
the mechanism of a free and open market and a national market system. 
Additionally, the Exchange believes the proposed rule change is 
consistent with the Section 6(b)(5) \25\ requirement that the rules of 
an exchange not be designed to permit unfair discrimination between 
customers, issuers, brokers, or dealers.

    \24\ 15 U.S.C. 78f(b)(5).
    \25\ Id.
---------------------------------------------------------------------------

    As discussed above, the Exchange initially adopted the Contingent 
Open to align its rule with similar functionality available at other 
equities exchanges.\26\ These other exchanges on which the Exchange 
based Rule 2615(d) currently offer early trading sessions,\27\ while 
the Exchange does not. On these exchanges, a Contingent Open serves as 
the end to the early trading session and beginning of the regular 
trading session. As discussed above, the Exchange believes it is not 
necessary for it perform a Contingent Open at 9:45 a.m. Eastern Time. 
The Exchange does not currently offer an early trading session and does 
not have a need for a Contingent Open to serve as a transition to its 
Regular Trading Session. Instead, the Exchange would prefer to wait to 
perform its Opening Process until the security begins to trade on the 
primary listing market before it also begins to trade that security. As 
noted above, the Exchange matches orders during its Opening Process at 
the midpoint of the NBBO. The Exchange believes that the midpoint of 
the NBBO present after the security is opened by the primary listing 
exchange may better reflect the true market for the security due to 
increased liquidity and improved market quality. Therefore, the 
Exchange believes the proposal promotes just and equitable principles 
of trade, and removes impediments to and perfects the mechanism of a 
free and open market and a national market system because a security 
might be trading at prices that are more in-line with its normal 
trading behavior.
---------------------------------------------------------------------------

    \26\ See supra note 18.
    \27\ See supra note 19.
---------------------------------------------------------------------------

    The proposed rule change would also not permit unfair 
discrimination between customers, issuers, brokers, or dealers because 
no User would be able to trade the security until the Exchange performs 
its Opening Process as described herein. The proposal is not designed 
to target any single type of market participant. It is simply intended 
to amend Exchange Rule 2615(d) to no longer provide for a Contingent 
Open. Should the Exchange begin to offer an

[[Page 88692]]

early trading session, the Contingent Open Process would serve as a 
transition period from the early to regular trading sessions, as it 
does today on other markets. The Exchange believes that, in the 
meantime, it may benefit all market participants for the Exchange to 
wait to trade a security until that security is opened by the primary 
listing exchange where that security's market may be more robust.
    The Exchange is not aware of any rule or regulation that requires 
an exchange to perform a Contingent Open or trade all securities for a 
full trading day. Should the Exchange seek to adopt an early trading 
session in the future, it anticipates that it would also seek to 
readopt a Contingent Open to set a time at which a security would 
transition from the early to regular trading sessions where it has not 
begun trading on the primary listing market.
    Lastly, the Exchange's proposal to make a corresponding change to 
remove a reference to the Contingent Open in the definition of Regular 
Trading Session in Exchange Rule 1901 remove impediments to and perfect 
the mechanism of a free and open market and a national market system 
because it would ensure the Exchange's rules are clear and continue to 
not include an ambiguities and references that could cause potential 
investor confusion.

B. Self-Regulatory Organization's Statement on Burden on Competition

    The Exchange does not believe the proposed rule change will impose 
any burden on competition that is not necessary or appropriate in 
furtherance of the purposes of the Act.
    Specifically, the Exchange does not believe the proposed rule 
change would impose an undue burden on intramarket competition on the 
Exchange because all Users would be impacted equally. No User would be 
able to trade an equity security on the Exchange until that security is 
opened by the primary listing market and the Exchange conducts its 
Opening Process. Other exchanges simply begin trading equity securities 
at 9:30:00 a.m. Eastern Time regardless of whether the security was 
opened by the primary listing exchange.\28\ Meanwhile, as noted above, 
other exchanges employ a contingent open at 9:45 a.m. Eastern Time.\29\ 
Market participants that wish to trade between 9:30 a.m. Eastern Time 
and the time the security is opened by the primary listing exchange may 
send their orders to these exchanges. Therefore, the proposed rule 
change should not impose any burden on intramarket competition that is 
not necessary or appropriate in furtherance of the purposes of the Act.
---------------------------------------------------------------------------

    \28\ See, e.g., NYSE National, Inc. Rule 7.34(a)(2) (defining 
Core Trading Session), and NYSE Chicago Rule 7.34(a)(2) (defining 
Core Trading Session).
    \29\ See supra note 27.
---------------------------------------------------------------------------

    In addition, the Exchange does not believe the proposed rule change 
would impose an undue burden on intermarket competition between 
exchanges. The Exchange is not aware of any rule or regulation that 
requires an exchange to perform a Contingent Open or trade all 
securities for a full trading day. The Exchange simply proposes to wait 
until an equity security is open for trading by the primary listing 
market before it conducts its own Opening Process and begins to trade 
that security. As stated above, other exchanges begin to trade an 
equity security at 9:30 a.m. Eastern Time and those exchanges may enjoy 
some competitive advantage as a result of the proposed rule change. The 
Exchange understands that it may suffer the competitive disadvantage 
until the time it performs its Opening Process. However, the Exchange 
does not believe the amount of trading volume that may be directed away 
from the Exchange to these exchanges would cause an unfair burden on 
competition between it and its exchange competitors. This competitive 
dynamic exists today with regard to pre-market and post-market trading 
on exchanges. The Exchange does not currently compete for order flow 
pre or post market because it does not offer trading outside of Regular 
Trading Hours. Therefore, the proposed rule change does not introduce 
any new competitive issues between exchanges. Based on the above, the 
Exchange does not believe the proposed rule change would impose a 
burden on intermarket competition that is not necessary or appropriate 
in furtherance of the purposes of the Act.
    Lastly, the Exchange's proposal to make a corresponding change to 
remove a reference to the Contingent Open in the definition of Regular 
Trading Session in Exchange Rule 1901 will have no competitive impact 
because it is simply a corresponding change to ensure the Exchange's 
rules are clear and continue to not include an ambiguities and 
references that could cause potential investor confusion.

C. Self-Regulatory Organization's Statement on Comments on the Proposed 
Rule Change Received From Members, Participants, or Others

    Written comments were neither solicited nor received.

III. Date of Effectiveness of the Proposed Rule Change and Timing for 
Commission Action

    Pursuant to Section 19(b)(3)(A) of the Act \30\ and Rule 19b-
4(f)(6) \31\ thereunder, the Exchange has designated this proposal as 
one that effects a change that: (i) does not significantly affect the 
protection of investors or the public interest; (ii) does not impose 
any significant burden on competition; and (iii) by its terms, does not 
become operative for 30 days after the date of the filing, or such 
shorter time as the Commission may designate if consistent with the 
protection of investors and the public interest.\32\
---------------------------------------------------------------------------

    \30\ 15 U.S.C. 78s(b)(3)(A).
    \31\ 17 CFR 240.19b-4(f)(6).
    \32\ In addition, Rule 19b-4(f)(6) requires a self-regulatory 
organization to give the Commission written notice of its intent to 
file the proposed rule change at least five business days prior to 
the date of filing of the proposed rule change, or such shorter time 
as designated by the Commission. The Exchange has satisfied this 
requirement.
---------------------------------------------------------------------------

    A proposed rule change filed under Rule 19b-4(f)(6) \33\ normally 
does not become operative prior to 30 days after the date of the 
filing. However, Rule 19b-4(f)(6)(iii) \34\ permits the Commission to 
designate a shorter time if such action is consistent with the 
protection of investors and the public interest. The Exchange requests 
that the Commission waive the 30-day operative delay so that the 
proposal may become operative immediately upon filing. The Exchange 
states that matching orders at the midpoint of the NBBO after a 
security is open on the primary market, as occurs during the Exchange's 
Opening Process, may better reflect the true market for the security 
than a midpoint execution during the Contingent Open, which may occur 
prior to the security being open on the primary listing market. The 
Exchange also states that waiver of the operative delay would not have 
a material impact on trading because: (i) the Exchange currently does 
not offer an early trading session and, therefore, the Contingent Open 
does not serve as a transition from an early trading session to a 
regular trading session; and (ii) the Exchange does not currently 
attract a material amount of order flow at the beginning of the trading 
day, and thus any impact by the Exchange not performing a Contingent 
Open would be minimal. Therefore, the Commission believes that waiver 
of the 30-day operative delay is consistent with the protection of 
investors and the public interest. Accordingly, the Commission hereby 
waives the 30-day operative delay and

[[Page 88693]]

designates the proposed rule change operative upon filing.\35\
---------------------------------------------------------------------------

    \33\ 17 CFR 240.19b-4(f)(6).
    \34\ 17 CFR 240.19b-4(f)(6)(iii).
    \35\ For purposes only of waiving the 30-day operative delay, 
the Commission has considered the proposed rule's impact on 
efficiency, competition, and capital formation. See 15 U.S.C. 
78c(f).
---------------------------------------------------------------------------

    At any time within 60 days of the filing of the proposed rule 
change, the Commission summarily may temporarily suspend such rule 
change if it appears to the Commission that such action is necessary or 
appropriate in the public interest, for the protection of investors, or 
otherwise in furtherance of the purposes of the Act. If the Commission 
takes such action, the Commission shall institute proceedings under 
Section 19(b)(2)(B) of the Act \36\ to determine whether the proposed 
rule should be approved or disapproved.
