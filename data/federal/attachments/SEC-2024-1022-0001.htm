I. Self-Regulatory Organization's Statement of the Terms of Substance 
of the Proposed Rule Change

    The Exchange proposes to establish fees for its expanded co-
location services, as described further below.
    While these amendments are effective upon filing, the Exchange has 
designated the proposed amendments to be operative on August 15, 2024.
    The text of the proposed rule change is available on the Exchange's 
website at <a href="https://listingcenter.nasdaq.com/rulebook/gemx/rules">https://listingcenter.nasdaq.com/rulebook/gemx/rules</a>, at the 
principal office of the Exchange, and at the Commission's Public 
Reference Room.

II. Self-Regulatory Organization's Statement of the Purpose of, and 
Statutory Basis for, the Proposed Rule Change

    In its filing with the Commission, the Exchange included statements 
concerning the purpose of and basis for the proposed rule change and 
discussed any comments it received on the proposed rule change. The 
text of these statements may be examined at the places specified in 
Item IV below. The Exchange has prepared summaries, set forth in 
sections A, B, and C below, of the most significant aspects of such 
statements.

A. Self-Regulatory Organization's Statement of the Purpose of, and 
Statutory Basis for, the Proposed Rule Change

1. Purpose
    The Exchange filed a proposal to expand its co-location services by 
offering new cabinet, power, and power distribution unit options in the 
Exchange's expanded data center.\3\ As described in that filing, the 
Exchange's current data center (``NY11'') in Carteret, NJ is undergoing 
an expansion (``NY11-4'') in response to demand for power and cabinets. 
The purpose of this proposed rule change is to establish fees for the 
expanded co-location services. Specifically, the Exchange proposes to 
establish (i) a monthly fee for Ultra High Density Cabinets, (ii) an 
installation fee for cabinets in NY11-4, (iii) fees for power 
installation in NY11-4, and (iv) fees for power distribution unit 
options in NY11-4.
---------------------------------------------------------------------------

    \3\ See SR-GEMX-2024-21 (not yet published).
---------------------------------------------------------------------------

Ultra High Density Cabinet
    Currently, co-location customers have the option of obtaining 
cabinets of various sizes and power densities. Co-location customers 
may obtain a Half Cabinet,\4\ a Low Density Cabinet with power density 
less than or equal to 2.88 kilowatts (``kW''), a Medium Density Cabinet 
with power density greater than 2.88 kW and less than or equal to 5 kW, 
a Medium-High Density Cabinet with power density greater than 5 kW and 
less than or equal to 7 kW, a High Density Cabinet with power density 
greater than 7 kW and less than 10 kW, and a Super High Density Cabinet 
with power density greater than 10 kW and less than or equal to 17.3 
kW.
---------------------------------------------------------------------------

    \4\ Half cabinets are not available to new subscribers. See 
General 8, Section 1(a).

---------------------------------------------------------------------------

[[Page 61548]]

    The Exchange filed a proposal to introduce a new cabinet choice in 
NY11-4, an ``Ultra High Density Cabinet,'' with power density greater 
than 10 kW and less than or equal to 15 kW.\5\ The Ultra High Density 
Cabinet option will only be offered in NY11-4 because of the power 
configuration necessary for such cabinets, which is not possible or 
available in other portions of the data center due to different power 
distribution.\6\ In addition to the Ultra High Density Cabinet, the 
Exchange will offer the other, existing cabinet options in NY11-4, with 
the exception of the Low Density Cabinet and Half Cabinet due to a lack 
of demand for such cabinets. The ongoing monthly fees for the Super 
High Density Cabinet, High Density Cabinet, Medium-High Density 
Cabinet, and Medium Density Cabinet are the same in NY11 and NY11-4 and 
the Exchange is not proposing to modify such fees.
---------------------------------------------------------------------------

    \5\ Supra note 3.
    \6\ Because of the addition of the Ultra High Density Cabinet 
option in NY11-4, the Super High Density Cabinet in NY11-4 will have 
power density greater than 15 kW and less than or equal to 17.3 kW.
---------------------------------------------------------------------------

    The Exchange proposes to establish an ongoing monthly fee of $7,230 
for the Ultra High Density Cabinets. To effectuate this change, the 
Exchange proposes to add the $7,230 ongoing monthly fee for Ultra High 
Density Cabinets to its fee schedule in General 8, Section 1(a). The 
Exchange notes that the proposed fee amount falls between the $4,748 
ongoing monthly fee charged for High Density Cabinets and the $8,440 
ongoing monthly fee charged for Super High Density Cabinets. 
Furthermore, the proposed fee is consistent with the existing ongoing 
monthly cabinet fees on a per kW basis. The existing monthly cabinet 
fees range from approximately $475 per kW to $916 per kW, while the 
proposed ongoing monthly cabinet fee for the Ultra High Density Cabinet 
ranges from approximately $482 per kW (at the high end of the power 
density range for Ultra High Density Cabinets) to $723 per kW (at the 
low end of the power density range for Ultra High Density Cabinets).
Installation Fee for Cabinets in NY11-4
    The Exchange proposes to establish a cabinet installation fee of 
$5,940 for all cabinets in NY11-4. To effectuate this change, the 
Exchange proposes to add the proposed $5,940 installation fee to its 
fee schedule in General 8, Section 1(a) for Super High Density 
Cabinets, Ultra High Density Cabinets, High Density Cabinets, Medium-
High Density Cabinets, and Medium Density Cabinets in NY11-4. In the 
existing data halls, customers may bring their own cabinets or use 
Exchange-provided cabinets. In NY11-4, because of the cooling system 
(hot aisle containment),\7\ all cabinets must be uniform and therefore, 
the Exchange will provide all cabinets, the cost of which is included 
in the $5,940 installation fee.\8\ The cabinets in NY11-4 include 
certain features not included in cabinets provided by the Exchange in 
the existing data halls. Specifically, the cabinets in NY11-4 include 
uniform, wider cabinets (32'' W x 48'' D x 91'' H), cable management, 
and a rear split door and combo lock. In addition, the proposed 
installation fee of $5,940 is comparable to fees charged for similar 
products.\9\
---------------------------------------------------------------------------

    \7\ The existing data halls utilize cold aisle containment to 
manage temperatures. Hot aisle containment is a more effective way 
to manage heat in the data center.
    \8\ In contrast, to the extent customers provide their own 
cabinets in NY11, there is an additional out-of-pocket cost for such 
cabinets.
    \9\ For example, NYSE charges an initial $5,000 fee for 
dedicated cabinets. See <a href="https://www.nyse.com/publicdocs/Wireless_Connectivity_Fees_and_Charges.pdf">https://www.nyse.com/publicdocs/Wireless_Connectivity_Fees_and_Charges.pdf</a>.
---------------------------------------------------------------------------

Installation Fee for Cabinet Power in NY11-4
    The cabinet power options for NY11-4 include: Phase 1 20 amp 240 
volt, Phase 1 32 amp 240 volt, Phase 1 40 amp 240 volt, Phase 3 20 amp 
415 volt, and Phase 3 32 amp 415 volt. These cabinet power options are 
specific to NY11-4 and one of these options must be selected for 
cabinets in NY11-4. The Exchange proposes to establish an installation 
fee of $3,600 for Phase 1 cabinet power options in NY11-4 and an 
installation fee of $4,560 for Phase 3 cabinet power options in NY11-4. 
To effectuate this change, the Exchange proposes to add the proposed 
fees to its fee schedule in General 8, Section 1(c). The Exchange also 
proposes not to charge an ongoing monthly fee for the cabinet power 
options in NY11-4 and update the fee schedule accordingly. For NY11-4, 
the data center operator is bringing in these higher voltage power 
options and is likely to experience increased power distribution 
efficiencies across the data center. The proposed power installation 
fees are higher in NY11-4 as compared to the existing data halls as the 
installation of the higher voltage power options costs more to the 
Exchange and is considered a premium product due to anticipated 
operational efficiencies.\10\ As between the Phase 1 and Phase 3 power 
options, the Phase 3 options provide a more efficient power source.
---------------------------------------------------------------------------

    \10\ Benefits include future proofing the data hall to allow for 
increasing power density in the future, requiring less whips to 
deliver the same amount of amperage, less circuits need to be 
installed to reach the same power supply, and safety improvements.
---------------------------------------------------------------------------

Fees for Power Distribution Unit Options
    The Exchange will offer power distribution units (``PDUs'') \11\ in 
NY11-4 as a convenience to customers. Rather than sourcing PDUs on a 
customer-by-customer basis, as the Exchange does for customers in NY11, 
the Exchange will offer Phase 1 and Phase 3 \12\ power distribution 
units in NY11-4. The Exchange proposes to establish a fee of $4,100 for 
a Phase 1 PDU and $5,260 for a Phase 3 PDU. This service is optional 
and customers may choose to provide their own PDUs appropriate for 
their power installation choices. The Exchange notes that, as part of 
such proposed fees, the Exchange would provide a primary and redundant 
PDU. As such, the proposed PDU fees covers a pair of PDUs. In addition, 
customers utilizing a Phase 1 or Phase 3 PDU provided by the Exchange 
have the ability to upgrade or downgrade between amperage levels 
without replacing the PDU, by a simple upgrade of the facility cord and 
a receptacle update.\13\ A PDU replacement is required when switching 
between phases/voltage.
---------------------------------------------------------------------------

    \11\ PDUs are devices fitted with multiple outputs designed to 
distribute electric power. The standardized PDUs would only be 
offered for NY11-4.
    \12\ Phase 1 PDUs are compatible with the following power 
options: Phase 1 20 amp 240 volt, Phase 1 32 amp 240 volt, and Phase 
1 40 amp 240 volt. Phase 3 PDUs are compatible with the following 
power options: Phase 3 20 amp 415 volt and Phase 3 32 amp 415 volt. 
Phase 1 and Phase 3 are available in NY11 and NY11-4. Phase 3 PDUs 
provide greater power density than Phase 1 PDUs by delivering power 
over three wires as opposed to one wire.
    \13\ This functionality may be available with customer-provided 
PDUs as well and depends on the PDU provided by the customer.
---------------------------------------------------------------------------

    The Exchange will also offer a switch monitored PDU add on in NY11-
4, which would allow customers to connect remotely to their PDU and 
control the power sockets. With the switch monitored PDU option, 
customers would be able to power cycle or shut off power remotely. The 
Exchange proposes to establish a $2,000 fee for the switch monitored 
PDU option. This option is optional as well and customers may choose to 
provide their own switch monitored PDU, if desired.
Implementation
    Although the timing is subject to change,\14\ the Exchange 
anticipates

[[Page 61549]]

opening NY11-4 Exchange access on October 21, 2024 and providing 
customers access in advance of this date. The proposed fees are 
designated to be operative on August 15, 2024. However, customer orders 
will not be fee liable until customers are provided access to the 
space.\15\
---------------------------------------------------------------------------

    \14\ The Exchange will announce modifications to the proposed 
timing via the Nasdaq Customer Portal, which is the web portal used 
for order and inventory management of colocation services, and email 
communication to all colocation customers.
    \15\ Charging customers once access is provided is consistent 
with current practice and allows customers to set up equipment and 
begin using power.
---------------------------------------------------------------------------

2. Statutory Basis
    The Exchange believes that its proposal is consistent with Section 
6(b) of the Act,\16\ in general, and furthers the objectives of 
Sections 6(b)(4) and 6(b)(5) of the Act,\17\ in particular, in that it 
provides for the equitable allocation of reasonable dues, fees and 
other charges among members and issuers and other persons using any 
facility, and is not designed to permit unfair discrimination between 
customers, issuers, brokers, or dealers.
---------------------------------------------------------------------------

    \16\ 15 U.S.C. 78f(b).
    \17\ 15 U.S.C. 78f(b)(4) and (5).
---------------------------------------------------------------------------

    The Exchange believes that the proposal to establish a monthly fee 
for Ultra High Density Cabinets, an installation fee for cabinets in 
NY11-4, installation fees for power installation in NY11-4, and fees 
for power distribution unit options in NY11-4 is reasonable. First, the 
Exchange's proposal to establish a $7,230 ongoing monthly fee for Ultra 
High Density Cabinets in NY11-4 is reasonable because it is comparable 
to the Exchange's current ongoing monthly fees for cabinets. The 
proposed fee amount falls between the $4,748 ongoing monthly fee 
charged for High Density Cabinets and the $8,440 ongoing monthly fee 
charged for Super High Density Cabinets. Furthermore, the proposed fee 
is consistent with the existing ongoing monthly cabinet fees on a per 
kW basis. The existing monthly cabinet fees range from approximately 
$475 per kW to $916 per kW, while the proposed ongoing monthly cabinet 
fee for the Ultra High Density Cabinet ranges from approximately $482 
per kW (at the high end of the power density range for Ultra High 
Density Cabinets) to $723 per kW (at the low end of the power density 
range for Ultra High Density Cabinets). Second, the Exchange believes 
that the proposed cabinet installation fee of $5,940 is reasonable as 
compared to the installation fees in NY11 (of $3,693-$4,748) because 
the proposed installation fee includes the cabinet itself, which 
includes certain enhanced features in NY11-4, including uniform, wider 
cabinets (32'' W x 48'' D x 91'' H), cable management, and a rear split 
door and combo lock. In contrast, in NY11, customers may choose to 
provide their own cabinets, incurring an additional cost. Furthermore, 
the proposed installation fee is comparable to the rate charged by NYSE 
for a similar product, as described above. Third, the Exchange believes 
that the power installation fees of $3,600 for Phase 1 power options 
and $4,560 for Phase 3 power options in NY11-4 are reasonable. As 
compared to power installation fees in NY11, the proposed rates for 
NY11-4 are higher because the Exchange will incur increased costs for 
installation of the higher voltage power options. In addition, the 
higher voltage power options will provide operational efficiencies for 
the data hall, as discussed above,\18\ warranting a higher fee. 
Finally, the Exchange believes that the proposed fees for PDUs and the 
PDU add on are reasonable because such fees are consistent with market 
rates. Furthermore, the Exchange is providing the PDU options as a 
convenience to customers. No customer is required to purchase any PDU 
options from the Exchange. Customers may choose to provide their own 
PDUs and PDU add ons.
---------------------------------------------------------------------------

    \18\ Supra note 10.
---------------------------------------------------------------------------

    The Exchange believes substitutable products and services are 
available to market participants, including, among other things, other 
options exchanges that a market participant may connect to in lieu of 
the Exchange,\19\ connectivity to the Exchange via a third-party 
reseller of connectivity, and/or trading of options products within 
markets which do not require connectivity to the Exchange, such as the 
Over-the-Counter (OTC) markets. Market participants that wish to 
connect to the Exchange will continue to choose the method of 
connectivity based on their specific needs. Market participants that 
wish to connect to the Exchange but want to avoid or mitigate the 
effect of these proposed fees can choose to connect to the Exchange 
through a vendor.
---------------------------------------------------------------------------

    \19\ There are currently 17 exchanges offering options trading 
services. No single options exchange trades more than 15% of the 
options market by volume and only one of the 17 options exchanges 
has a market share over 10 percent. See Nasdaq, Options Market 
Statistics (Last updated July 3, 2024), available at <a href="https://www.nasdaqtrader.com/Trader.aspx?id=OptionsVolumeSummary">https://www.nasdaqtrader.com/Trader.aspx?id=OptionsVolumeSummary</a>. This broad 
dispersion of market share demonstrates that market participants can 
and do exercise choice in trading venues. Further, low barriers to 
entry mean that new exchanges may rapidly enter the market and offer 
additional substitute platforms to further compete with the Exchange 
and the products it offers.
---------------------------------------------------------------------------

    In summary, the proposal represents an equitable allocation of 
reasonable dues, fees and other charges because customers have choices 
in how they connect to the Exchange, the proposed monthly fee for Ultra 
High Density Cabinets is comparable to current fees charged by the 
Exchange for other cabinets, the Exchange will provide uniform cabinets 
in NY11-4 with special features, the proposed cabinet installation fee 
is consistent with that of comparable products offered by other 
providers, the Exchange will incur increased costs for new power 
installation in NY11-4, higher voltage power options will provide 
operational efficiencies for the data hall, and PDU options are 
provided as a convenience to customers and customers may choose to 
provide their own PDUs.
    The Exchange believes that the proposed fee changes are not 
unfairly discriminatory because the cabinet, power, and PDU fees for 
NY11-4 are available to and assessed uniformly across all market 
participants. In addition, all customers have the choice of whether and 
how to connect to the Exchange.

B. Self-Regulatory Organization's Statement on Burden on Competition

    The Exchange does not believe that the proposed rule change will 
impose any burden on competition not necessary or appropriate in 
furtherance of the purposes of the Act.
    Nothing in the proposal burdens inter-market competition because 
approval of the proposal does not impose any burden on the ability of 
other exchanges to compete. The Exchange operates in a highly 
competitive market in which market participants can determine whether 
or not to connect to the Exchange based on the value received compared 
to the cost of doing so. Indeed, market participants have numerous 
alternative exchanges that they may participate on and direct their 
order flow, as well as off-exchange venues, where competitive products 
are available for trading.
    Nothing in the proposal burdens intra-market competition because 
the Ultra High Density Cabinets, cabinet power options, and PDU 
optionality in NY11-4 are available to any customer under the same fees 
as any other customer, and any customer that wishes to order cabinets, 
power and PDUs in NY11-4 can do so on a non-discriminatory basis.

C. Self-Regulatory Organization's Statement on Comments on the Proposed 
Rule Change Received From Members, Participants, or Others

    No written comments were either solicited or received.

III. Date of Effectiveness of the Proposed Rule Change and Timing for 
Commission Action

    The foregoing rule change has become effective pursuant to Section 
19(b)(3)(A)(ii) of the Act.\20\ At any time within 60 days of the 
filing of the proposed rule change, the Commission summarily may 
temporarily suspend such rule change if it appears to the Commission 
that such action is: (i) necessary or appropriate in the public 
interest; (ii) for the protection of investors; or (iii) otherwise in 
furtherance of the purposes of the Act. If the Commission takes such 
action, the Commission shall institute proceedings to determine whether 
the proposed rule should be approved or disapproved.
