SECURITIES AND EXCHANGE COMMISSION

[SEC File No. 270-135, OMB Control No. 3235-0176]


Proposed Collection; Comment Request; Extension: Rule 8b-1 to 8b-
5; 8b-10 to 8b-22; and 8b-25 to 8b-31

Upon Written Request, Copies Available From: Securities and Exchange 
Commission, Office of FOIA Services, 100 F Street NE, Washington, DC 
20549-2736

    Notice is hereby given that, pursuant to the Paperwork Reduction 
Act of 1995 (44 U.S.C. 3501 et seq.), the Securities and Exchange 
Commission (``Commission'') is soliciting comments on the collection of 
information summarized below. The Commission plans to submit this 
existing collection of information to the Office of Management and 
Budget (``OMB'') for extension and approval.
    Rules 8b-1 to 8b-5; 8b-10 to 8b-22; and 8b-25 to 8b-31 (``rules 
under Section 8(b)'') (17 CFR 270.8b-1 to 8b-33) under the Investment 
Company Act of 1940 (15 U.S.C. 80a-1 et seq.) (``Investment Company 
Act'') set forth the procedures for preparing and filing a registration 
statement under the Investment Company Act. These procedures are 
intended to facilitate the registration process. These rules generally 
do not require respondents to report information.\1\
---------------------------------------------------------------------------

    \1\ Although the rules under Section 8(b) of the Investment 
Company Act are generally procedural in nature, two of the rules 
require respondents to disclose some limited information. Rule 8b-3 
(17 CFR 270.8b-3) provides that whenever a registration form 
requires the title of securities to be stated, the registrant must 
indicate the type and general character of the securities to be 
issued. Rule 8b-22 (17 CFR 270.8b-22) provides that if the existence 
of control is open to reasonable doubt, the registrant may disclaim 
the existence of control, but it must state the material facts 
pertinent to the possible existence of control. The information 
required by both of these rules is necessary to ensure that 
investors have clear and complete information upon which to base an 
investment decision.
---------------------------------------------------------------------------

    The Commission believes that it is appropriate to estimate the 
total respondent burden associated with preparing each registration 
statement form rather than attempt to isolate the impact of the 
procedural instructions under Section 8(b) of the Investment Company 
Act, which impose burdens only in the context of the preparation of the 
various registration statement forms. Accordingly, the Commission is 
not submitting a separate burden estimate for the rules under Section 
8(b), but instead will include the burden for these rules in its 
estimates of burden for each of the registration forms under the 
Investment Company Act. The Commission is, however, submitting an 
hourly burden estimate of one hour for administrative purposes.
    The collection of information under the rules under Section 8(b) is 
mandatory. The information provided under the rules under Section 8(b) 
is not kept confidential. An agency may not conduct or sponsor, and a 
person is not required to respond to, a collection of information 
unless it displays a currently valid OMB control number.
    Written comments are invited on: (a) whether the proposed 
collection of information is necessary for the proper performance of 
the functions of the Commission, including whether the information 
shall have practical utility; (b) the accuracy of the Commission's 
estimate of the burden of the collection of information; (c) ways to 
enhance the quality, utility, and clarity of the information collected; 
and (d) ways to minimize the burden of the collection of information on 
respondents, including through the use of automated collection 
techniques or other forms of information technology. Consideration will 
be given to comments and suggestions submitted by February 12, 2024.
    An agency may not conduct or sponsor, and a person is not required 
to respond to, a collection of information under the PRA unless it 
displays a currently valid OMB control number.
    Please direct your written comments to: David Bottom, Chief 
Information Officer, Securities and Exchange Commission, c/o John 
Pezzullo, 100 F Street NE, Washington, DC 20549 or send an email to:
