I. Self-Regulatory Organization's Statement of the Terms of Substance 
of the Proposed Rule Change

    The Exchange proposes to list and trade shares of the following 
under Rule 8.900-E (Managed Portfolio Shares): FM Compounders Equity 
ETF. The proposed rule change is available on the Exchange's website at 
<a href="http://www.nyse.com">www.nyse.com</a>, at the principal office of the Exchange, and at the 
Commission's Public Reference Room.

II. Self-Regulatory Organization's Statement of the Purpose of, and 
Statutory Basis for, the Proposed Rule Change

    In its filing with the Commission, the self-regulatory organization 
included statements concerning the purpose of, and basis for, the 
proposed rule change and discussed any comments it received on the 
proposed rule change. The text of those statements may be examined at 
the places specified in Item IV below. The Exchange has prepared 
summaries, set forth in sections A, B, and C below, of the most 
significant parts of such statements.

A. Self-Regulatory Organization's Statement of the Purpose of, and the 
Statutory Basis for, the Proposed Rule Change

1. Purpose
    NYSE Arca Rule 8.900-E permits the listing and trading, or trading 
pursuant to unlisted trading privileges, of Managed Portfolio Shares, 
which are securities issued by an actively managed open-end investment 
management company.\4\ Rule 8.900-E(b)(1) requires the Exchange to file 
separate proposals under Section 19(b) of the Act before listing and 
trading any series of Managed Portfolio Shares on the Exchange. 
Therefore, the Exchange is submitting this proposal in order to list 
and trade Managed Portfolio Shares of the FM Compounders Equity ETF 
(the ``Fund'') under Rule 8.900-E.
---------------------------------------------------------------------------

    \4\ Rule 8.900-E(c)(1) provides that the term ``Managed 
Portfolio Share'' means a security that (a) represents an interest 
in an investment company registered under the Investment Company Act 
of 1940 (``Investment Company'') organized as an open-end management 
investment company that invests in a portfolio of securities 
selected by the Investment Company's investment adviser consistent 
with the Investment Company's investment objectives and policies; 
(b) is issued in a Creation Unit, or multiples thereof, in return 
for a designated portfolio of instruments (and/or an amount of cash) 
with a value equal to the next determined net asset value and 
delivered to the Authorized Participant (as defined in the 
Investment Company's Form N-1A filed with the Commission) through a 
Confidential Account; (c) when aggregated into a Redemption Unit, or 
multiples thereof, may be redeemed for a designated portfolio of 
instruments (and/or an amount of cash) with a value equal to the 
next determined net asset value delivered to the Confidential 
Account for the benefit of the Authorized Participant; and (d) the 
portfolio holdings for which are disclosed within at least 60 days 
following the end of every fiscal quarter.
---------------------------------------------------------------------------

    The Commission has previously approved \5\ and noticed for 
immediate effectiveness \6\ listing and trading on the Exchange of 
Managed Portfolio Shares under NYSE Arca Rule 8.900-E.
---------------------------------------------------------------------------

---------------------------------------------------------------------------

Description of the Fund and the Trust
    The shares of the Fund (the ``Shares'') will be issued by Northern 
Lights Fund Trust IV (the ``Trust''), a statutory trust organized under 
the laws of the state of Delaware and registered with the Commission as 
an open-end management investment company.\7\ The investment adviser to 
the Fund will be First Manhattan Co. LLC (the ``Adviser''). The sub-
adviser to the Fund will be Vident Advisory, LLC dba Vident Asset 
Management (the ``Sub-Adviser''). Northern Lights Distributors, LLC 
(the ``Distributor'') will serve as the distributor for the Fund's 
Shares. All statements and representations made in this filing 
regarding (a) the description of the portfolio or reference assets, (b) 
limitations on portfolio holdings or reference assets, or (c) the 
applicability of Exchange rules shall constitute continued listing 
requirements for listing the Shares on the Exchange, as provided under 
Rule 8.900-E(b)(1).
---------------------------------------------------------------------------

    \7\ The Trust is registered under the Investment Company Act of 
1940 (the ``1940 Act''). On August 9, 2024, the Trust filed a 
registration statement on Form N-1A under the Securities Act of 1933 
(the ``1933 Act'') and the 1940 Act for the Fund (File No.811-23066) 
(the ``Registration Statement''). The Commission issued an order 
granting exemptive relief to the Trust (``Exemptive Order'') under 
the 1940 Act on March 22, 2022 (Investment Company Act Release No. 
34537). The Exemptive Order was granted in response to the Trust's 
application for exemptive relief (the ``Exemptive Application'') 
(File No. 812-15282). The description of the operation of the Trust 
and the Fund herein is based, in part, on the Registration 
Statement. The Exchange will not commence trading in Shares of the 
Fund until this proposed rule change is operative.
---------------------------------------------------------------------------

    Rule 8.900-E(b)(4) provides that, if the investment adviser to the 
Investment Company issuing Managed Portfolio Shares is registered as a 
broker-dealer or is affiliated with a broker-dealer, such investment 
adviser will erect and maintain a ``fire wall'' between the investment 
adviser and personnel of the broker-dealer or broker-dealer affiliate, 
as applicable, with respect to access to information concerning the 
composition of and/or changes to such Investment Company portfolio and/
or the Creation Basket.\8\ Any person related to the investment adviser 
or Investment Company who makes decisions pertaining to the Investment 
Company's portfolio composition or has access to information regarding 
the Investment Company's portfolio composition or changes thereto or 
the Creation Basket must be subject to procedures designed to prevent 
the use and dissemination of material non-public information regarding 
the applicable Investment Company portfolio or changes thereto or the 
Creation Basket.
---------------------------------------------------------------------------

    \8\ Rule 8.900-E(c)(5) provides that the term ``Creation 
Basket'' means, on any given business day, the names and quantities 
of the specified instruments (and/or an amount of cash) that are 
required for an AP Representative to deposit in-kind on behalf of an 
Authorized Participant in exchange for a Creation Unit and the names 
and quantities of the specified instruments (and/or an amount of 
cash) that will be transferred in-kind to an AP Representative on 
behalf of an Authorized Participant in exchange for a Redemption 
Unit, which will be identical and will be transmitted to each AP 
Representative before the commencement of trading.
---------------------------------------------------------------------------

    Rule 8.900-E(b)(4) is similar to Commentary .03(a)(i) and (iii) to 
Rule 5.2-E(j)(3); however, Commentary .03(a) in connection with the 
establishment of a ``fire wall'' between the investment adviser and the 
broker-dealer reflects the applicable open-end fund's portfolio, not an 
underlying benchmark index, as is the case with index-based funds.\9\ 
Rule 8.900-E(b)(4) is also

[[Page 88319]]

similar to Commentary .06 to Rule 8.600-E related to Managed Fund 
Shares, except that Rule 8.900-E(b)(4) relates to establishment and 
maintenance of a ``fire wall'' between the investment adviser and 
personnel of the broker-dealer or broker-dealer affiliate, as 
applicable, with respect to an Investment Company's portfolio and 
Creation Basket, and not just to the underlying portfolio, as is the 
case with Managed Fund Shares. Neither the Adviser nor the Sub-Adviser 
is registered as a broker-dealer. The Sub-Adviser is not affiliated 
with a broker-dealer. The Adviser, however, is affiliated with a 
broker-dealer. The Adviser has implemented and will maintain a ``fire 
wall'' with respect to such broker-dealer affiliate regarding access to 
information concerning the composition of and/or changes to the Fund's 
portfolio and/or Creation Basket.
---------------------------------------------------------------------------

    \9\ An investment adviser to an open-end fund is required to be 
registered under the Investment Advisers Act of 1940 (the ``Advisers 
Act''). As a result, the Adviser and its related personnel will be 
subject to the provisions of Rule 204A-1 under the Advisers Act 
relating to codes of ethics. This Rule requires investment advisers 
to adopt a code of ethics that reflects the fiduciary nature of the 
relationship to clients as well as compliance with other applicable 
securities laws. Accordingly, procedures designed to prevent the 
communication and misuse of non-public information by an investment 
adviser must be consistent with Rule 204A-1 under the Advisers Act. 
In addition, Rule 206(4)-7 under the Advisers Act makes it unlawful 
for an investment adviser to provide investment advice to clients 
unless such investment adviser has (i) adopted and implemented 
written policies and procedures reasonably designed to prevent 
violations, by the investment adviser and its supervised persons, of 
the Advisers Act and the Commission rules adopted thereunder; (ii) 
implemented, at a minimum, an annual review regarding the adequacy 
of the policies and procedures established pursuant to subparagraph 
(i) above and the effectiveness of their implementation; and (iii) 
designated an individual (who is a supervised person) responsible 
for administering the policies and procedures adopted under 
subparagraph (i) above. The Fund will also be required to comply 
with Exchange rules relating to disclosure, including Rule 5.3-E(i).
---------------------------------------------------------------------------

    In the event (a) the Adviser or the Sub-Adviser becomes registered 
as a broker-dealer or becomes newly affiliated with a broker-dealer, or 
(b) any new adviser or sub-adviser is a registered broker-dealer, or 
becomes affiliated with a broker-dealer, it will implement and maintain 
a fire wall with respect to personnel of the broker-dealer or broker-
dealer affiliate regarding access to information concerning the 
composition and/or changes to the portfolio and/or Creation Basket. Any 
person related to the Adviser, the Sub-Adviser or the Trust who makes 
decisions pertaining to the Fund's portfolio composition or that has 
access to information regarding the Fund's portfolio composition or 
that has access to information regarding the Fund's portfolio or 
changes thereto or the Creation Basket will be subject to procedures 
designed to prevent the use and dissemination of material non-public 
information regarding such portfolio or changes thereto and the 
Creation Basket.
    Further, Rule 8.900-E(b)(5) requires that any person or entity, 
including an AP Representative (as defined below), custodian, Reporting 
Authority, distributor, or administrator, who has access to non-public 
information regarding the Investment Company's portfolio composition or 
changes thereto or the Creation Basket, must be subject to procedures 
reasonably designed to prevent the use and dissemination of material 
non-public information regarding the applicable Investment Company 
portfolio or changes thereto or the Creation Basket. Moreover, if any 
such person or entity is registered as a broker-dealer or affiliated 
with a broker-dealer, such person or entity will erect and maintain a 
``fire wall'' between the person or entity and the broker-dealer with 
respect to access to information concerning the composition and/or 
changes to such Investment Company portfolio or Creation Basket.
Description of the Fund \10\
---------------------------------------------------------------------------

    \10\ The Exchange represents that, for initial and continued 
listing, the Fund will be in compliance with Rule 10A-3 under the 
Act. See 17 CFR 240.10A-3.
---------------------------------------------------------------------------

    The Fund's holdings will conform to the permissible investments as 
set forth in the Exemptive Application and Exemptive Order, and the 
holdings will be consistent with all requirements in the Exemptive 
Application and Exemptive Order.\11\
---------------------------------------------------------------------------

    \11\ Pursuant to the Exemptive Order, the only permissible 
investments for the Fund are the following that trade on a U.S. 
exchange contemporaneously with Shares of the Fund: exchange-traded 
funds (``ETFs''), exchange-traded notes, exchange-listed common 
stocks, exchange-traded preferred stocks, exchange-traded American 
Depositary Receipts, exchange-traded real estate investment trusts, 
exchange-traded commodity pools, exchange-traded metal trusts, 
exchange-traded currency trusts, and exchange-traded futures for 
which the reference asset is one in which the Fund may invest 
directly, in the case of an index future traded on a U.S. exchange, 
is based on an index, the components of which are a type of asset in 
which the Fund could invest directly, as well as cash and cash 
equivalents (which are short-term U.S. Treasury securities, 
government money market funds, and repurchase agreements). All of 
the equity instruments or futures held by the Fund will be traded on 
an exchange that is a member of the Intermarket Surveillance Group 
(``ISG'') or affiliated with a member of ISG or with which the 
Exchange has in place a comprehensive surveillance sharing 
agreement.
---------------------------------------------------------------------------

    According to the Registration Statement, the Fund's primary 
objective is to seek long-term capital appreciation. The Fund will seek 
to invest in 25-35 U.S. exchange-traded common stocks of various market 
capitalization. From time to time, the Fund may hold a greater number 
of stocks.
    Under normal circumstances, the Fund will invest at least 80% of 
its net assets in equity securities. According to the Registration 
Statement, the Adviser and/or the Sub-Adviser focuses on companies that 
it expects to generate free cash flow and that it believes to possess 
durable competitive advantages, earn higher than average returns on 
capital, and have opportunities to reinvest excess cash flows at above-
average rates of return. The Adviser and/or the Sub-Adviser seeks 
investments that may include: (1) compounders (highly resilient 
businesses that reliably generate and compound free cash flow), (2) 
undervalued businesses (companies, often out of favor, that the Adviser 
and/or the Sub-Adviser believes are undervalued relative to their 
earnings power, cash flow, and/or tangible assets), and/or (3) special 
situations (companies undergoing restructuring, refinancing, management 
changes, and/or comparable corporate actions that cause temporary 
disconnects between the share price and what the Adviser and/or the 
Sub-Adviser believes to be the company's intrinsic value).
    According to the Registration Statement, in effecting its 
investment strategy, once an investment opportunity is identified, the 
Adviser and/or the Sub-Adviser will seek to purchase the shares at 
valuations that are favorable relative to the quality of the company's 
business, its earnings, and the Adviser's and/or the Sub-Adviser's 
expectation for long-term growth in value-per-share. Generally, the 
Fund will focus on making long-term investments. However, the Adviser 
and/or the Sub-Adviser may sell a Fund holding when: (1) the holding no 
longer meets the Adviser's and/or the Sub-Adviser's investment criteria 
or the requirements of the Exemptive Order or its Exchange listing 
requirements; (2) the holding's long-term earnings and reinvestment 
prospects deteriorate; (3) the Adviser and/or the Sub-Adviser loses 
confidence in the leadership and governance of the holding; (4) a new 
holding is judged to be comparatively more attractive than a current 
position; and/or (5) the valuation of a holding appears excessively 
higher than the Adviser's and/or the Sub-Adviser's estimates of long-
term value.
    According to the Registration Statement, the Fund is a non-
diversified investment company, which means that a meaningful portion 
of its assets may be invested in the securities of a smaller number of 
companies and/or a more limited number of sectors.
    The Fund is a non-transparent, actively managed ETF that does not 
seek to replicate the performance of a specified index.

[[Page 88320]]

    According to the Registration Statement, the Fund will invest in 
cash (and cash equivalents) when the Fund is unable to find enough 
attractive long-term investments to meet its investment objective.
Investment Restrictions
    The Fund's holdings will be consistent with all requirements 
described in the Exemptive Application and Exemptive Order.\12\
---------------------------------------------------------------------------

    \12\ See note 11, supra.
---------------------------------------------------------------------------

    The Fund's investments, including derivatives, will be consistent 
with its investment objective and will not be used to enhance leverage 
(although certain derivatives and other investments may result in 
leverage). That is, the Fund's investments will not be used to seek 
performance that is the multiple or inverse multiple (e.g., 2X or -3X) 
of any securities benchmark index. As noted above, the Fund will not 
seek to replicate the performance of a specified index.
Creations and Redemptions of Shares
    Creations and redemptions of Shares will take place as described in 
Rule 8.900-E. Specifically, in connection with the creation and 
redemption of Creation Units \13\ the delivery or receipt of any 
portfolio securities in-kind will be required to be effected through a 
separate confidential brokerage account (a ``Confidential 
Account'').\14\ An Authorized Participant (``AP''), as defined in the 
applicable Form N-1A filed with the Commission, will sign an agreement 
with an AP Representative \15\ establishing the Confidential Account 
for the benefit of the AP. AP Representatives will be broker-dealers. 
An AP must be a participant in the Continuous Net Settlement System of 
the National Securities Clearing Corporation (``NSCC'') or a 
participant in the Depository Trust Company (``DTC'') and must have 
executed an authorized participant agreement (``Participant 
Agreement'') with the Distributor with respect to the creation and 
redemption of Creation Units and formed a Confidential Account for its 
benefit in accordance with the terms of the Participant Agreement. For 
purposes of creations or redemptions, all transactions will be effected 
through the respective AP's Confidential Account, for the benefit of 
the AP, without disclosing the identity of such securities to the AP.
---------------------------------------------------------------------------

    \13\ Rule 8.900-E(c)(6) provides that the term ``Creation Unit'' 
means a specified minimum number of Managed Portfolio Shares issued 
by an Investment Company at the request of an Authorized Participant 
in return for a designated portfolio of instruments and/or cash. 
Rule 8.900-E(c)(7) provides that the term ``Redemption Unit'' means 
a specified minimum number of Managed Portfolio Shares that may be 
redeemed to an Investment Company at the request of an Authorized 
Participant in return for a portfolio of instruments and/or cash. 
For purposes of this filing, the terms ``Creation Unit'' means 
either a Creation Unit as defined in Rules 8.900-E(c)(6) or a 
Redemption Unit as defined in Rule 8.900-E(c)(7).
    \14\ Rule 8.900-E(c)(4) provides that the term ``Confidential 
Account'' means an account owned by an Authorized Participant and 
held with an AP Representative on behalf of the Authorized 
Participant. The account will be established and governed by 
contractual agreement between the AP Representative and the 
Authorized Participant solely for the purposes of creation and 
redemption, while keeping confidential the Creation Basket 
constituents of each series of Managed Portfolio Shares, including 
from the Authorized Participant. The books and records of the 
Confidential Account will be maintained by the AP Representative on 
behalf of the Authorized Participant.
    \15\ Rule 8.900-E(c)(3) provides that the term ``AP 
Representative'' means an unaffiliated broker-dealer, with which an 
Authorized Participant has signed an agreement to establish a 
Confidential Account for the benefit of such Authorized Participant, 
that will deliver or receive, on behalf of the Authorized 
Participant, all consideration to or from the Investment Company in 
a creation or redemption. An AP Representative will not be permitted 
to disclose the Creation Basket to any person, including the 
Authorized Participants.
---------------------------------------------------------------------------

    Each business day, the Fund's custodian will transmit the 
composition of the Fund's Creation Basket (as described below) to each 
AP Representative. This information will permit an AP that has 
established a Confidential Account with an AP Representative to 
transact in the underlying securities of the Creation Basket through 
their AP Representatives, enabling them to engage in in-kind creation 
or redemption activity without knowing the identity or weighting of 
those securities. Fund Shares will be issued and redeemed in Creation 
Units of 5,000 Shares. The size of a Creation Unit is subject to 
change. The Fund will offer and redeem Creation Units on a continuous 
basis at the net asset value (``NAV'') per Share next determined after 
receipt of an order in proper form. The Fund's NAV per Share will be 
determined as of the closing time of the regular trading session on the 
Exchange (ordinarily, 4:00 p.m. E.T.) on each day that the Exchange is 
open.
    In order to keep costs low and permit the Fund to be as fully 
invested as possible, Shares will be purchased and redeemed in Creation 
Units and principally in-kind for securities or in cash for the value 
of such securities. The Fund will issue Creation Units principally in 
exchange for (i) the in-kind deposit of a designated portfolio of 
securities (the ``Deposit Securities''), which for each Creation Unit 
will constitute a substantial replication, or a representation, of the 
securities included in the Fund's portfolio, and (ii) if applicable, an 
amount of cash (the ``Cash Component''). Together, the Deposit 
Securities and the Cash Component, if applicable, constitute the ``Fund 
Deposit.'' The Deposit Securities and the securities that will be 
delivered in an in-kind transfer in a redemption (the ``Fund 
Securities'') will be identical. The Cash Component is an amount equal 
to the difference between the NAV of the Shares of the Fund (per 
Creation Unit) and the market value of the Deposit Securities. The Cash 
Component serves the function of compensating for any differences 
between the NAV per Creation Unit and the market value of the Deposit 
Securities.
    On each business day, prior to the opening of business on the 
Exchange (ordinarily, 9:30 a.m. E.T.), the custodian will make 
available through NSCC the list of the company names and the required 
number of shares of each Deposit Security, as applicable, and Cash 
Component, as applicable, to be included in the current Fund Deposit 
(based on information at the end of the previous business day) for the 
Fund. The Deposit Securities, as applicable, and Cash Component, as 
applicable, announced are applicable to purchases of Creation Units 
until the next-announced composition of the Fund Deposit. When full or 
partial cash purchases of Creation Units are available or specified for 
the Fund, they will be effected in essentially the same manner as in-
kind purchases thereof.
    On any given business day, the names and quantities of the 
instruments that constitute the Deposit Securities and the names and 
quantities of the instruments that constitute the Fund Securities will 
be identical to and will correspond pro rata to the positions in the 
Fund's portfolio (including cash positions), and these instruments may 
be referred to, in the case of either a purchase or a redemption, as 
the ``Creation Basket.''
Placement of Purchase Orders
    The Fund will issue Shares through the Distributor on a continuous 
basis at NAV. The Exchange represents that the issuance of Shares will 
operate in a manner substantially similar to that of other ETFs. The 
Fund will issue Shares only at the NAV per Share next determined after 
an order in proper form is received.
    A creation transaction, which is subject to acceptance by the 
Distributor, generally begins when an AP enters into an irrevocable 
creation order with the Fund and delivers to the AP Representative the 
cash necessary to purchase the designated portfolio of

[[Page 88321]]

securities that constitute the Creation Basket in the Confidential 
Account. The AP Representative then purchases and delivers the 
designated portfolio of securities to the Fund's custodian, and the 
Fund then instructs the custodian to exchange such portfolio of 
securities for a specified number of Shares in volumes of Creation 
Units. The AP Representative will seek to assemble the shares of the 
Creation Basket in a manner that will not reveal its composition. The 
Distributor will furnish acknowledgements to those placing such orders 
that the orders have been accepted, but the Distributor may reject any 
order which is not submitted in proper form, as described in the Fund's 
prospectus or Statement of Additional Information (``SAI'').
    The NAV of the Fund is expected to be determined once each business 
day as of the close of the regular trading session on the Exchange 
(ordinarily, 4:00 p.m. E.T.). An AP must submit an irrevocable purchase 
order by the time set forth in the Participant Agreement and/or 
applicable order form, on any business day in order to receive that 
business day's NAV. On days when the Exchange closes or is anticipated 
to close earlier than normal, the Fund may require purchase orders to 
be placed earlier in the day. The date on which an order to purchase 
(or redeem, as further described below) Creation Units is received and 
accepted is referred to as the ``Order Placement Date.''
    Purchases of Shares will be settled in-kind and/or in cash for an 
amount equal to the applicable NAV per Share purchased plus applicable 
transaction fees.\16\ The Fund may permit full or partial cash 
purchases of Creation Units of the Fund under the circumstances 
described above. When full or partial cash purchases of Creation Units 
are available or specified for the Fund, they will be effected in 
essentially the same manner as in-kind purchases thereof. In the case 
of a full or partial cash purchase, the AP, through the AP 
Representative, must pay the cash equivalent of the Deposit Securities 
it would otherwise provide through an in-kind purchase, plus the same 
Cash Component required to be paid in connection with an in-kind 
purchase.
---------------------------------------------------------------------------

    \16\ To the extent that the Fund allows creations or redemptions 
to be conducted in cash, such transactions will be effected in the 
same manner for all APs transacting in cash.
---------------------------------------------------------------------------

Authorized Participant Redemption
    The Shares may be redeemed to the Fund in Creation Unit size or 
multiples thereof as described below. Redemption orders of Creation 
Units must be placed by or through an AP. Creation Units of the Fund 
will be redeemable at their NAV per Share next determined after receipt 
of a redemption request in proper form. Orders to redeem Creation Units 
must be submitted in proper form prior to the time as set forth in the 
Participant Agreement.
    Each business day, prior to the opening of trading on the Exchange 
(currently 9:30 a.m., Eastern time), the custodian will transmit to 
each AP Representative the identity and the required number of each 
Fund Security and, as applicable and under the circumstances described 
below, the cash value of the Fund Securities that will be applicable to 
redemption requests for that day, and the amount of the Cash Redemption 
Amount (as defined below, if any). A redemption transaction generally 
begins when an AP enters into an irrevocable redemption order with the 
Fund. The Fund then instructs the custodian to deliver a designated 
portfolio of securities that constitute the Creation Basket to the 
appropriate AP Representative's Confidential Account in exchange for 
the Fund Shares in volumes of Creation Units being redeemed. Orders to 
redeem Creation Units must submitted in proper form prior to the time 
as set forth in the Participant Agreement.
    Redemption proceeds for a Creation Unit are paid in-kind, in cash, 
or combination thereof, as determined by the Trust. With respect to in-
kind redemptions of a Fund, redemption proceeds for a Creation Unit 
will consist of Fund Securities, as announced by the custodian on the 
business day of the request for redemption received in proper form plus 
cash in an amount equal to the difference between the NAV of the Shares 
of the Fund being redeemed, as next determined after a receipt of a 
request in proper form, and the value of Fund Securities (the ``Cash 
Redemption Amount''), less any fixed redemption transaction fee as set 
forth below and any applicable additional variable charge as set forth 
below. In the event that the Fund's securities have a value greater 
than the NAV of the Shares of the Fund, the Cash Redemption Amount 
equal to the differential is required to be made by the AP to the Fund. 
The Participant Agreement signed by each AP will require establishment 
of a Confidential Account to receive distributions of securities in-
kind upon redemption. Each AP will be required to open a Confidential 
Account with an AP Representative in order to facilitate orderly 
processing of redemptions.
Net Asset Value
    The NAV will be calculated for the Shares of the Fund on each 
business day. The Fund's NAV is determined as of the close of regular 
trading on the New York Stock Exchange, normally 4:00 p.m., E.T. The 
NAV of the Fund's Shares is determined by adding the total value of its 
assets, subtracting its liabilities and then dividing the result by the 
number of Shares outstanding.
    In computing the Fund's NAV, the Fund's securities holdings are 
valued based on their last readily available market price. Securities 
for which such information is readily available are generally valued at 
the last reported sales price, the official closing price as reported 
by an independent pricing service on the primary market or exchange on 
which they are traded, or, in the absence of reported sales, at the 
mean between the current bid and ask prices on such exchange. If market 
prices are unavailable or the Fund thinks that they are unreliable, or 
when the value of a security has been materially affected by events 
occurring after the relevant market closes, the Fund will price those 
securities at fair value as determined in good faith using methods 
approved by the Fund's Board.
    More information about the valuation of the Fund's holdings can be 
found in the SAI.
    Information regarding the Fund's NAV and how often Shares of the 
Fund traded at a price above (i.e., at a premium) or below (i.e., at a 
discount) the Fund's NAV will be available on the Fund's website 
(<a href="http://www.firstmanhattan.com">www.firstmanhattan.com</a>).
Availability of Information
    The Fund's website, (<a href="http://www.firstmanhattan.com">www.firstmanhattan.com</a>), will include the 
prospectus for the Fund that may be downloaded. The Fund's website will 
include additional quantitative information updated on a daily basis, 
including the prior business day's NAV, market closing price or mid-
point of the bid/ask spread at the time of calculation of such NAV (the 
``Bid/Ask Price''),\17\ and a calculation of the premium and discount 
of the market closing price or Bid/Ask Price against the NAV. The 
website and information will be publicly available at no charge.
---------------------------------------------------------------------------

    \17\ The Bid/Ask Price of the Fund's Shares is determined using 
the mid-point between the current national best bid and offer at the 
time of calculation of the Fund's NAV. The records relating to Bid/
Ask Prices will be retained by the Fund or its service providers.
---------------------------------------------------------------------------

    Form N-PORT requires reporting of a Fund's complete portfolio 
holdings on a position-by-position basis on a quarterly

[[Page 88322]]

basis within 60 days after fiscal quarter end. Investors can obtain a 
Fund's SAI, its shareholder reports, its Form N-CSR, filed twice a 
year, and its Form N-CEN, filed annually. The Fund's SAI and 
shareholder reports are available free upon request from the Fund, and 
those documents and the Form N-PORT, Form N-CSR, and Form N-CEN may be 
viewed onscreen or downloaded from the Commission's website at 
<a href="http://www.sec.gov">www.sec.gov</a>.
    Information regarding market price and trading volume of the Shares 
will be continually available to market participants on a real-time 
basis throughout the day on brokers' computer screens and other 
electronic services. Information regarding the previous day's closing 
price and trading volume information for the Shares will be published 
daily in the financial section of newspapers. Quotation and last sale 
information for the Shares will be available via the Consolidated Tape 
Association (``CTA'') high-speed line. In addition, the Verified 
Intraday Indicative Value (``VIIV''), as defined in Rule 8.900-
E(c)(2),\18\ will be widely disseminated by the Reporting Authority 
\19\ and/or one or more major market data vendors in one second 
intervals during the Exchange's Core Trading Session.
---------------------------------------------------------------------------

    \18\ Rule 8.900-E(c)(2) provides that the term ``Verified 
Intraday Indicative Value'' is the indicative value of a Managed 
Portfolio Share based on all of the holdings of a series of Managed 
Portfolio Shares as of the close of business on the prior business 
day and, for corporate actions, based on the applicable holdings as 
of the opening of business on the current business day, priced and 
disseminated in one second intervals during the Core Trading Session 
by the Reporting Authority.
    \19\ Rule 8.900-E(c)(8) provides that the term ``Reporting 
Authority'' in respect of a particular series of Managed Portfolio 
Shares means the Exchange, an institution, or a reporting service 
designated by the Exchange or by the exchange that lists a 
particular series of Managed Portfolio Shares (if the Exchange is 
trading such series pursuant to unlisted trading privileges), as the 
official source for calculating and reporting information relating 
to such series, including, but not limited to, the NAV, the VIIV, or 
other information relating to the issuance, redemption, or trading 
of Managed Portfolio Shares. A series of Managed Portfolio Shares 
may have more than one Reporting Authority, each having different 
functions.
---------------------------------------------------------------------------

Dissemination of the VIIV
    With respect to trading of the Shares, the ability of market 
participants to buy and sell Shares at prices near the VIIV is 
dependent upon their assessment that the VIIV is a reliable, indicative 
real-time value for the Fund's underlying holdings. Market participants 
are expected to accept the VIIV as a reliable, indicative real-time 
value because (1) the VIIV will be calculated and disseminated based on 
the Fund's actual portfolio holdings, (2) the securities in which the 
Fund plans to invest are generally highly liquid and actively traded 
and trade at the same time as the Fund and therefore generally have 
accurate real time pricing available, and (3) market participants will 
have a daily opportunity to evaluate whether the VIIV at or near the 
close of trading is indeed predictive of the actual NAV.
    The VIIV will be widely disseminated by the Reporting Authority 
and/or by one or more major market data vendors in one second intervals 
during the Core Trading Session and will be disseminated to all market 
participants at the same time. The VIIV is based on the current market 
value of the securities in the Fund's portfolio that day. The 
methodology for calculating the Fund's VIIV will be available on the 
Fund's website. The VIIV is intended to provide investors and other 
market participants with a highly correlated per Share value of the 
underlying portfolio that can be compared to the current market price. 
Therefore, under normal circumstances the VIIV would be effectively a 
near real time approximation of the Fund's NAV, which will be computed 
only once a day, and is available free of charge from one or more 
market data vendors.
Trading Halts
    With respect to trading halts, the Exchange may consider all 
relevant factors in exercising its discretion to halt or suspend 
trading in the Shares of the Fund.\20\ Trading in Shares of the Fund 
will be halted if the circuit breaker parameters in Rule 7.12-E have 
been reached. Trading also may be halted because of market conditions 
or for reasons that, in the view of the Exchange, make trading in the 
Shares inadvisable. Trading in the Shares will be subject to Rule 
8.900-E(d)(2)(C), which sets forth circumstances under which Shares of 
the Fund will be halted.
---------------------------------------------------------------------------

    \20\ See Rule 7.12-E.
---------------------------------------------------------------------------

    Specifically, Rule 8.900-E(d)(2)(C)(i) provides that the Exchange 
may consider all relevant factors in exercising its discretion to halt 
trading in a series of Managed Portfolio Shares. Trading may be halted 
because of market conditions or for reasons that, in the view of the 
Exchange, make trading in the series of Managed Portfolio Shares 
inadvisable. These may include: (a) the extent to which trading is not 
occurring in the securities and/or the financial instruments composing 
the portfolio; or (b) whether other unusual conditions or circumstances 
detrimental to the maintenance of a fair and orderly market are 
present.\21\
---------------------------------------------------------------------------

    \21\ The Exemptive Application provides that the Investment 
Company or their agent will request that the Exchange halt trading 
in the applicable series of Managed Portfolio Shares where: (i) the 
intraday indicative values calculated by the calculation engines 
differ by more than 25 basis points for 60 seconds in connection 
with pricing of the VIIV; or (ii) holdings representing 10% or more 
of a series of Managed Portfolio Shares' portfolio have become 
subject to a trading halt or otherwise do not have readily available 
market quotations. Any such requests will be one of many factors 
considered in order to determine whether to halt trading in a series 
of Managed Portfolio Shares and the Exchange retains sole discretion 
in determining whether trading should be halted. As provided in the 
Exemptive Application, each series of Managed Portfolio Shares would 
employ a pricing verification agent to continuously compare two 
intraday indicative values during regular trading hours in order to 
ensure the accuracy of the VIIV.
---------------------------------------------------------------------------

    Rule 8.900-E(d)(2)(C)(ii) provides that, if the Exchange becomes 
aware that: (i) the VIIV of a series of Managed Portfolio Shares is not 
being calculated or disseminated in one second intervals, as required; 
(ii) the NAV with respect to a series of Managed Portfolio Shares is 
not disseminated to all market participants at the same time; (iii) the 
holdings of a series of Managed Portfolio Shares are not made available 
on at least a quarterly basis as required under the 1940 Act; or (iv) 
such holdings are not made available to all market participants at the 
same time (except as otherwise permitted under the currently applicable 
exemptive order or no-action relief granted by the Commission or 
Commission staff to the Investment Company with respect to the series 
of Managed Portfolio Shares), it will halt trading in such series until 
such time as the VIIV, the NAV, or the holdings are available, as 
required.
Trading Rules
    The Exchange deems the Shares to be equity securities, thus 
rendering trading in the Shares subject to the Exchange's existing 
rules governing the trading of equity securities. Shares will trade on 
the Exchange in all trading sessions in accordance with Rule 7.34-E(a). 
As provided in Rule 7.6-E, the minimum price variation (``MPV'') for 
quoting and entry of orders in equity securities traded on the NYSE 
Arca Marketplace is $0.01, with the exception of securities that are 
priced less than $1.00, for which the MPV for order entry is $0.0001. A 
minimum of 50,000 Shares of the Fund will be outstanding at the 
commencement of trading on the Exchange.
    The Shares will conform to the initial and continued listing 
criteria under Rule 8.900-E, as well as all terms in the Exemptive 
Order. The Exchange will obtain a representation from the issuer

[[Page 88323]]

of the Shares of the Fund that the NAV per Share of the Fund will be 
calculated daily and will be made available to all market participants 
at the same time.
Surveillance
    The Exchange believes that its surveillance procedures are adequate 
to properly monitor the trading of Shares on the Exchange during all 
trading sessions and to deter and detect violations of Exchange rules 
and the applicable federal securities laws. Trading of Shares through 
the Exchange will be subject to the Exchange's surveillance procedures 
for derivative products. As part of these surveillance procedures and 
consistent with Rule 8.900-E(b)(3) and 8.900-E(d)(2)(B), the Adviser 
will upon request make available to the Exchange and/or the Financial 
Industry Regulatory Authority (``FINRA''), on behalf of the Exchange, 
the daily portfolio holdings of the Fund. The issuer of the Shares of 
the Fund will be required to represent to the Exchange that it will 
advise the Exchange of any failure by the Fund to comply with the 
continued listing requirements, and, pursuant to its obligations under 
Section 19(g)(1) of the Act, the Exchange will surveil for compliance 
with the continued listing requirements. If the Fund is not in 
compliance with the applicable listing requirements, the Exchange will 
commence delisting procedures under Exchange Rule 5.5-E(m).
    FINRA, on behalf of the Exchange, or the regulatory staff of the 
Exchange, or both, will communicate as needed regarding trading in the 
Shares and certain exchange-traded instruments with other markets and 
other entities that are members of the Intermarket Surveillance Group 
(``ISG''), and FINRA, on behalf of the Exchange, or the regulatory 
staff of the Exchange, or both, may obtain trading information 
regarding trading such securities from such markets and other entities. 
In addition, the Exchange may obtain information regarding trading in 
the Shares and certain exchange-traded instruments from markets and 
other entities that are members of ISG or with which the Exchange has 
in place a comprehensive surveillance sharing agreement.
    In addition, the Exchange also has a general policy prohibiting the 
distribution of material, non-public information by its employees.
2. Statutory Basis
    The Exchange believes that the proposed rule change is consistent 
with Section 6(b) of the Act,\22\ in general, and furthers the 
objectives of Section 6(b)(5) of the Act,\23\ in particular, in that it 
is designed to prevent fraudulent and manipulative acts and practices, 
to promote just and equitable principles of trade, to remove 
impediments to and perfect the mechanism of a free and open market and 
a national market system, and, in general, to protect investors and the 
public interest.

    \22\ 15 U.S.C. 78f(b).
    \23\ 15 U.S.C. 78f(b)(5).
---------------------------------------------------------------------------

    The Exchange believes that this proposed rule change is designed to 
prevent fraudulent and manipulative acts and practices in that the Fund 
would meet each of the rules relating to listing and trading of Managed 
Portfolio Shares. To the extent that the Fund is not in compliance with 
such rules, the Exchange would either prevent the Fund from listing and 
trading on the Exchange or commence delisting procedures under Rule 
8.900-E(d)(2)(B). Specifically, the Exchange would consider the 
suspension of trading, and commence delisting proceedings under Rule 
8.900-E(d)(2)(B), of the Fund under any of the following circumstances: 
(a) if, following the initial twelve-month period after commencement of 
trading on the Exchange, there are fewer than 50 beneficial holders of 
the Fund; (b) if the Exchange has halted trading in the Fund because 
the VIIV is interrupted pursuant to Rule 8.900-E(d)(2)(C)(ii) and such 
interruption persists past the trading day in which it occurred or is 
no longer available; (c) if the Exchange has halted trading in the Fund 
because the net asset value with respect to such Fund is not 
disseminated to all market participants at the same time, the holdings 
of such Fund are not made available on at least a quarterly basis as 
required under the 1940 Act, or such holdings are not made available to 
all market participants at the same time pursuant to Rule 8.900-
E(d)(2)(C)(ii) and such issue persists past the trading day in which it 
occurred; (d) if the Exchange has halted trading in Shares of the Fund 
pursuant to Rule 8.900-E(d)(2)(C)(i) and such issue persists past the 
trading day in which it occurred; (e) if the Fund has failed to file 
any filings required by the Commission or if the Exchange is aware that 
the Fund is not in compliance with the conditions of any currently 
applicable exemptive order or no-action relief granted by the 
Commission or Commission staff with respect to the Fund; (f) if any of 
the continued listing requirements set forth in Rule 8.900-E are not 
continuously maintained; (g) if any of the statements of 
representations regarding (a) the description of the portfolio, (b) 
limitations on portfolio holdings, or (c) the applicability of Exchange 
listing rules as specified herein to permit the listing and trading of 
the Fund, are not continuously maintained; or (h) if such other event 
shall occur or condition exists which, in the opinion of the Exchange, 
makes further dealings on the Exchange inadvisable.
    As discussed above, neither the Adviser nor the Sub-Adviser is 
registered as a broker-dealer. The Sub-Adviser is not affiliated with a 
broker-dealer. The Adviser, however, is affiliated with a broker-dealer 
and has implemented and will maintain a ``fire wall'' with respect to 
such affiliate broker-dealer regarding access to information concerning 
the composition and/or changes to the Fund's portfolio and Creation 
Basket. In the event that (a) the Adviser or the Sub-Adviser becomes 
registered as a broker-dealer or becomes newly affiliated with a 
broker-dealer, or (b) any new adviser or sub-adviser is a registered 
broker-dealer or becomes affiliated with a broker-dealer, the Adviser 
and/or the Sub-Adviser will implement and maintain a fire wall with 
respect to personnel of the broker-dealer or broker-dealer affiliate 
regarding access to information concerning the composition and/or 
changes to the portfolio and/or Creation Basket. Any person related to 
the Adviser, the Sub-Adviser or the Trust who makes decisions 
pertaining to the Fund's portfolio composition or that has access to 
information regarding the Fund's portfolio or changes thereto or the 
Creation Basket will be subject to procedures designed to prevent the 
use and dissemination of material non-public information regarding such 
portfolio or changes thereto and the Creation Basket.
    In addition, Rule 8.900-E(b)(5) requires that any person or entity, 
including an AP Representative, custodian, Reporting Authority, 
distributor, or administrator, who has access to non-public information 
regarding the Investment Company's portfolio composition or changes 
thereto or the Creation Basket, must be subject to procedures designed 
to prevent the use and dissemination of material non-public information 
regarding the applicable Investment Company portfolio or changes 
thereto or the Creation Basket. Moreover, if any such person or entity 
is registered as a broker-dealer or affiliated with a broker-dealer, 
such person or entity will erect and maintain a ``fire wall'' between 
the person or entity and the broker-dealer with respect to access to 
information

[[Page 88324]]

concerning the composition and/or changes to such Investment Company 
portfolio or Creation Basket. Any person or entity who has access to 
information regarding the Fund's portfolio composition or changes 
thereto or the Creation Basket will be subject to procedures designed 
to prevent the use and dissemination of material nonpublic information 
regarding the portfolio or changes thereto or the Creation Basket.
    The Exchange further believes that Rule 8.900-E is designed to 
prevent fraudulent and manipulative acts and practices related to the 
listing and trading of Shares of the Fund because it provides 
meaningful requirements about both the data that will be made publicly 
available about the Shares, as well as the information that will only 
be available to certain parties and the controls on such information. 
Specifically, the Exchange believes that the requirements related to 
information protection set forth in Rule 8.900-E(b)(5) will act as a 
safeguard against misuse and improper dissemination of information 
related to the Fund's portfolio composition, the Creation Basket, or 
changes thereto. The requirement that any person or entity implement 
procedures to prevent the use and dissemination of material non-public 
information regarding the portfolio or Creation Basket will act to 
prevent any individual or entity from sharing such information 
externally and the internal ``fire wall'' requirements applicable where 
an entity is a registered broker-dealer or affiliated with a broker-
dealer will act to make sure that no entity will be able to misuse the 
data for their own purposes. Accordingly, the Exchange believes that 
this proposal is designed to prevent fraudulent and manipulative acts 
and practices.
    The Exchange further believes that the proposal is designed to 
prevent fraudulent and manipulative acts and practices related to the 
listing and trading of Shares of the Fund and to promote just and 
equitable principles of trade and to protect investors and the public 
interest because the Exchange would halt trading under certain 
circumstances under which trading in the Shares of the Fund may be 
inadvisable. Specifically, trading in the Shares will be subject to 
Rule 8.900-E(d)(2)(C)(i), which provides that the Exchange may consider 
all relevant factors in exercising its discretion to halt trading in 
the Fund. Trading may be halted because of market conditions or for 
reasons that, in the view of the Exchange, make trading in the series 
of Managed Portfolio Shares inadvisable. These may include: (a) the 
extent to which trading is not occurring in the securities and/or the 
financial instruments composing the portfolio; or (b) whether other 
unusual conditions or circumstances detrimental to the maintenance of a 
fair and orderly market are present.\24\ Additionally, trading in the 
Shares will be subject to Rule 8.900-E(d)(2)(C)(ii), which provides 
that the Exchange would halt trading where the Exchange becomes aware 
that: (a) the VIIV of a series of Managed Portfolio Shares is not being 
calculated or disseminated in one second intervals, as required; (b) 
the net asset value with respect to a series of Managed Portfolio 
Shares is not disseminated to all market participants at the same time; 
(c) the holdings of a series of Managed Portfolio Shares are not made 
available on at least a quarterly basis as required under the 1940 Act; 
or (d) such holdings are not made available to all market participants 
at the same time (except as otherwise permitted under the currently 
applicable exemptive order or no-action relief granted by the 
Commission or Commission staff to the Investment Company with respect 
to the series of Managed Portfolio Shares). The Exchange would halt 
trading in such Shares until such time as the VIIV, the NAV, or the 
holdings are available, as required.
---------------------------------------------------------------------------

    \24\ See note 20, supra.
---------------------------------------------------------------------------

    With respect to the proposed listing and trading of Shares of the 
Fund, the Exchange believes that the proposed rule change is designed 
to prevent fraudulent and manipulative acts and practices in that the 
Shares will be listed and traded on the Exchange pursuant to the 
initial and continued listing criteria in Rule 8.900-E.\25\ The Fund's 
holdings will conform to the permissible investments as set forth in 
the Exemptive Application and Exemptive Order.\26\ As noted above, 
FINRA, on behalf of the Exchange, or the regulatory staff of the 
Exchange, or both, will communicate as needed regarding trading in the 
Shares and the underlying exchange-traded instruments with other 
markets and other entities that are members of the ISG, and FINRA, on 
behalf of the Exchange, or the regulatory staff of the Exchange, or 
both, may obtain trading information regarding trading such instruments 
from such markets and other entities. In addition, the Exchange may 
obtain information regarding trading in the Shares and the underlying 
exchange-traded instruments from markets and other entities that are 
members of ISG or with which the Exchange has in place a comprehensive 
surveillance sharing agreement.
---------------------------------------------------------------------------

    \25\ The Exchange represents that, for initial and continued 
listing, the Fund will be in compliance with Rule 10A-3 under the 
Act. See 17 CFR 240.10A-3.
    \26\ See note 11, supra.
---------------------------------------------------------------------------

    With respect to trading of Shares of the Fund, the ability of 
market participants to buy and sell Shares at prices near the VIIV is 
dependent upon their assessment that the VIIV is a reliable, indicative 
real-time value for the Fund's underlying holdings. Market participants 
are expected to accept the VIIV as a reliable, indicative real-time 
value because (1) the VIIV will be calculated and disseminated based on 
the Fund's actual portfolio holdings, (2) the securities in which the 
Fund plans to invest are generally highly liquid and actively traded 
and trade at the same time as the Fund and therefore generally have 
accurate real time pricing available, and (3) market participants will 
have a daily opportunity to evaluate whether the VIIV at or near the 
close of trading is indeed predictive of the actual NAV.
    The proposed rule change is designed to promote just and equitable 
principles of trade and to protect investors and the public interest in 
that the Exchange will obtain a representation that the NAV per Share 
of the Fund will be calculated daily and that the NAV will be made 
available to all market participants at the same time. Investors can 
also obtain the Fund's SAI, its shareholder reports, its Form N-CSR 
(filed twice a year), and its Form N-CEN (filed annually). The Fund's 
SAI and shareholder reports will be available free upon request from 
the Fund, and those documents and the Form N-PORT, Form N-CSR, and Form 
N-CEN may be viewed on-screen or downloaded from the Commission's 
website at <a href="http://www.sec.gov">www.sec.gov</a>. In addition, a large amount of information will 
be publicly available regarding the Fund and the Shares, thereby 
promoting market transparency. Quotation and last sale information for 
the Shares will be available via the CTA high-speed line. Information 
regarding the VIIV will be widely disseminated in one second intervals 
throughout the Core Trading Session by the Reporting Authority and/or 
one or more major market data vendors. The website for the Fund will 
include a prospectus for the Fund that may be downloaded, and 
additional data relating to NAV and other applicable quantitative 
information, updated on a daily basis. Moreover, prior to the 
commencement of trading, the Exchange will inform its members in an 
Information Bulletin of the special

[[Page 88325]]

characteristics and risks associated with trading the Shares.
    In addition, as noted above, investors will have ready access to 
the VIIV, and quotation and last sale information for the Shares. The 
Shares will conform to the initial and continued listing criteria under 
Rule 8.900-E. The Fund's investments, including derivatives, will be 
consistent with its investment objective and will not be used to 
enhance leverage (although certain derivatives and other investments 
may result in leverage). That is, the Fund's investments will not be 
used to seek performance that is the multiple or inverse multiple 
(e.g., 2X or -3X) of any securities benchmark index.
    The Exchange also believes that the proposed rule change is 
designed to perfect the mechanism of a free and open market and, in 
general, to protect investors and the public interest in that it will 
facilitate the listing and trading of actively-managed exchange-traded 
products that will enhance competition among market participants, to 
the benefit of investors and the marketplace. As noted above, the 
Exchange has in place surveillance procedures relating to trading in 
the Shares and may obtain information via ISG from other exchanges that 
are members of ISG or with which the Exchange has entered into a 
comprehensive surveillance sharing agreement. In addition, as noted 
above, investors will have ready access to information regarding the 
VIIV and quotation and last sale information for the Shares.
    For the above reasons, the Exchange believes that the proposed rule 
change is consistent with the requirements of Section 6(b)(5) of the 
Act.

B. Self-Regulatory Organization's Statement on Burden on Competition

    The Exchange does not believe that the proposed rule change will 
impose any burden on competition that is not necessary or appropriate 
in furtherance of the purposes of the Act. The Exchange believes the 
proposed rule change would permit the listing and trading of an 
additional actively-managed exchange-traded product, thereby promoting 
competition among exchange-traded products to the benefit of investors 
and the marketplace.

C. Self-Regulatory Organization's Statement on Comments on the Proposed 
Rule Change Received From Members, Participants, or Others

    No written comments were solicited or received with respect to the 
proposed rule change.

III. Date of Effectiveness of the Proposed Rule Change and Timing for 
Commission Action

    Because the foregoing proposed rule change does not: (i) 
significantly affect the protection of investors or the public 
interest; (ii) impose any significant burden on competition; and (iii) 
become operative for 30 days from the date on which it was filed, or 
such shorter time as the Commission may designate, it has become 
effective pursuant to Section 19(b)(3)(A) of the Act \27\ and Rule 19b-
4(f)(6) thereunder.\28\
---------------------------------------------------------------------------

    \27\ 15 U.S.C. 78s(b)(3)(A).
    \28\ 17 CFR 240.19b-4(f)(6). In addition, Rule 19b-4(f)(6)(iii) 
requires a self-regulatory organization to give the Commission 
written notice of its intent to file the proposed rule change, along 
with a brief description and text of the proposed rule change, at 
least five business days prior to the date of filing of the proposed 
rule change, or such shorter time as designated by the Commission. 
The Exchange has satisfied this requirement.
---------------------------------------------------------------------------

    A proposed rule change filed pursuant to Rule 19b-4(f)(6) under the 
Act normally does not become operative for 30 days after the date of 
its filing. However, Rule 19b-4(f)(6)(iii) \29\ permits the Commission 
to designate a shorter time if such action is consistent with the 
protection of investors and the public interest. The Exchange has 
requested that the Commission waive the 30-day operative delay so that 
the proposal may become operative immediately upon filing. The Exchange 
notes that the Commission has noticed for immediate effectiveness 
proposed rule changes to permit listing and trading on the Exchange of 
Managed Portfolio Shares similar to the Fund.\30\ The proposed listing 
rule for the Fund raises no novel legal or regulatory issues. Thus, the 
Commission believes that waiver of the 30-day operative delay is 
consistent with the protection of investors and the public interest. 
Accordingly, the Commission hereby waives the 30-day operative delay 
and designates the proposed rule change operative upon filing.\31\
---------------------------------------------------------------------------

    \29\ 17 CFR 240.19b-4(f)(6)(iii).
    \30\ See supra note 6.
    \31\ For purposes only of waiving the 30-day operative delay, 
the Commission has also considered the proposed rule's impact on 
efficiency, competition, and capital formation. See 15 U.S.C. 
78c(f).
---------------------------------------------------------------------------

    At any time within 60 days of the filing of such proposed rule 
change, the Commission summarily may temporarily suspend such rule 
change if it appears to the Commission that such action is necessary or 
appropriate in the public interest, for the protection of investors, or 
otherwise in furtherance of the purposes of the Act.
