Agency Information Collection Activities: Comment Request

AGENCY: Export-Import Bank of the United States.

ACTION: Submission for OMB review and comments request.

SUMMARY: The Export-Import Bank of the United States (EXIM), as part of 
its continuing effort to reduce paperwork and respondent burden,

law. Employees may seek a legal exception to the vaccination 
requirement due to a disability, using the reasonable accommodation 
Form. The agency may also ask for other information, as needed. 
Requests for ``medical accommodation'' or ``medical exceptions'' will 
be treated as requests for a disability accommodation and evaluated and 
decided under applicable Rehabilitation Act standards for reasonable 
accommodation absent undue hardship to the agency.

assured of consideration.
