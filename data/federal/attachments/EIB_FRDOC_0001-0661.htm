EXPORT-IMPORT BANK

[Public Notice: 2022-3003]


Agency Information Collection Activities: Comment Request

AGENCY: Export-Import Bank of the United States.

ACTION: Submission for OMB review and comments request.

-----------------------------------------------------------------------

SUMMARY: The Export-Import Bank of the United States (EXIM), as part of 
its continuing effort to reduce paperwork and respondent burden, 
invites the general public and other Federal Agencies to comment on the 
proposed information collection, as required by the Paperwork Reduction 
Act of 1995. Government-wide policy requires all Federal employees to 
be vaccinated against COVID-19, with exceptions only as required by 
law. Employees may seek a legal exception to the vaccination 
requirement due to a disability, using the reasonable accommodation 
Form. The agency may also ask for other information, as needed. 
Requests for ``medical accommodation'' or ``medical exceptions'' will 
be treated as requests for a disability accommodation and evaluated and 
decided under applicable Rehabilitation Act standards for reasonable 
accommodation absent undue hardship to the agency.

DATES: Comments must be received on or before March 28, 2022 to be 
assured of consideration.

ADDRESSES: Comments may be submitted electronically on 
WWW.REGULATIONS.GOV (EIB 21-03) or by email to <a href="/cdn-cgi/l/email-protection#6b250a00020a45291e191f04052b570a4b03190e0d56" http: exim.gov">exim.gov</a>"><a href="/cdn-cgi/l/email-protection" class="__cf_email__" data-cfemail="c38da2a8aaa2ed81b6b1b7acad83">[email&#160;protected]</a><a href="http://exim.gov">exim.gov</a></a>, 
or by mail to Nakia Burton, Export-Import Bank, 811 Vermont Ave. NW, 
Washington, DC 20571. The information collection tool can be reviewed 
at: eib21-03.pdf (<a href="http://exim.gov">exim.gov</a>).

FOR FURTHER INFORMATION CONTACT: To request additional information, 
please Nakia Burton <a href="/cdn-cgi/l/email-protection" class="__cf_email__" data-cfemail="1f717e74767e317d6a6d6b70715f">[email&#160;protected]</a><a href="http://exim.gov">exim.gov</a>, 202-565-3225.

SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION: 
    Title and Form Number: EIB 21-03 REQUEST FOR A MEDICAL EXCEPTION TO 
THE COVID-19 VACCINATION REQUIREMENT.
    OMB Number: 3048-xxxx.
    Type of Review: Regular.
    Need and Use: The information collected will allow EXIM to 
determine compliance and content for transaction requests submitted to 
the Export-Import Bank under its insurance, guarantee, and direct loan 
programs.
    A Notice Regarding Injunctions: The vaccination requirement issued 
pursuant to E.O. 14043, is currently the subject of a nationwide 
injunction. While that injunction remains in place, EXIM will not 
process requests for a medical exception from the COVID-19 vaccination 
requirement pursuant to E.O. 14043. EXIM will also not request the 
submission of any medical information related to a request for an 
exception from the vaccination requirement pursuant to E.O. 14043 while 
the injunction remains in place. But EXIM may nevertheless receive 
information regarding a medical exception. That is because, if EXIM 
were to receive a request for an exception from the COVID-19 
vaccination requirement pursuant to E.O. 14043 during the pendency of 
the injunction, EXIM will accept the request, hold it in abeyance, and 
notify the employee who submitted the request that implementation and 
enforcement of the COVID-19 vaccination requirement pursuant to E.O. 
14043 is currently enjoined and that an exception therefore is not 
necessary so long as the injunction is in place. In other words, during 
the pendency of the injunction, any information collection related to 
requests for medical exception from the COVID-19 vaccination 
requirement pursuant to E.O. 14043 is not undertaken to implement or 
enforce the COVID-19 vaccination requirement.
    Affected Public: This form affects EXIM employees.
    Annual Number of Respondents: 12.
    Estimated Time per Respondent: 2 hours.
