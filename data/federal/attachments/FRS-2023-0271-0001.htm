will consider all comments received from the public and other agencies.
    During the comment period for this proposal, a copy of the proposed 
PRA OMB submission, including the draft reporting form and 
instructions, supporting statement (which contains more detail about 
the information collection and burden estimates than this notice), and 
other documentation, will be made available on the Board's public

Request for Comment on Information Collection Proposal

    The Board invites public comment on the following information 
collection, which is being reviewed under authority delegated by the 
OMB under the PRA. Comments are invited on the following:
    a. Whether the proposed collection of information is necessary for 
the proper performance of the Board's functions, including whether the 
information has practical utility;
    b. The accuracy of the Board's estimate of the burden of the 
proposed information collection, including the validity of the 
methodology and assumptions used;
    c. Ways to enhance the quality, utility, and clarity of the 
information to be collected;
    d. Ways to minimize the burden of information collection on 
respondents, including through the use of automated collection 
techniques or other forms of information technology; and
    e. Estimates of capital or startup costs and costs of operation, 
maintenance, and purchase of services to provide information.
    At the end of the comment period, the comments and recommendations 
received will be analyzed to determine the extent to which the Board 
should modify the proposal.

Without Revision, the Following Information Collection

    Collection title: Board Public Website Usability Surveys.
    Collection identifier: FR 3076.

    General description of collection: The Board uses the ad hoc FR 
3076 to seek input (1) from users or potential users of the Board's 
public website and social media tools, (2) about the Board's outreach, 
and (3) about other communication tools used by Board. The FR 3076 is 
offered to a diverse audience of individuals including consumers, 
bankers, media, government employees, educators, and others. Responses 
to the FR 3076 are used to help improve the usability and offerings on 
the Board's public website and other online public communications. The 
FR 3076 comprises two parts: surveys and focus groups. The frequency of 
the surveys and content of the questions varies as needs arise for 
feedback on different Board resources and from different audiences. The 
FR 3076 surveys may be conducted up to 12 times per year. In addition, 
the Board plans to conduct up to four focus group sessions per year.
