SECURITIES AND EXCHANGE COMMISSION

[Release No. 34-100083; File No. SR-NYSEARCA-2024-37]


Self-Regulatory Organizations; NYSE Arca, Inc.; Notice of Filing 
and Immediate Effectiveness of Proposed Rule Change To Amend the NYSE 
Arca Equities Fees and Charges

May 9, 2024.
    Pursuant to Section 19(b)(1) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 
(``Act''),\1\ and Rule 19b-4 thereunder,\2\ notice is hereby given that 
on May 1, 2024, NYSE Arca, Inc. (``NYSE Arca'' or the ``Exchange'') 
filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission (``SEC'' or 
``Commission'') the proposed rule change as described in Items I, II, 
and III below, which Items have been prepared by the Exchange. The 
Commission is publishing this notice to solicit comments on the 
proposed rule change from interested persons.

I. Self-Regulatory Organization's Statement of the Terms of Substance 
of the Proposed Rule Change

    The Exchange proposes to amend the NYSE Arca Equities Fees and 
Charges (``Fee Schedule'') to amend the Mid-Point Liquidity (``MPL'') 
Order pricing tiers. The Exchange proposes to implement the fee changes 
effective May 1, 2024. The proposed rule change is available on the 
Exchange's website at <a href="http://www.nyse.com">www.nyse.com</a>, at the principal office of the 
Exchange, and at the Commission's Public Reference Room.

II. Self-Regulatory Organization's Statement of the Purpose of, and 
Statutory Basis for, the Proposed Rule Change

    In its filing with the Commission, the self-regulatory organization 
included statements concerning the purpose of, and basis for, the 
proposed rule change and discussed any comments it received on the 
proposed rule change. The text of those statements may be examined at 
the places specified in Item IV below. The Exchange has prepared 
summaries, set forth in sections A, B, and C below, of the most 
significant parts of such statements.

A. Self-Regulatory Organization's Statement of the Purpose of, and 
Statutory Basis for, the Proposed Rule Change

1. Purpose
    The Exchange proposes to amend the Fee Schedule to amend the MPL 
Order \3\ pricing tiers. More specifically, the Exchange proposes to 
adopt new MPL Tiers 1 and 2. The Exchange proposes to implement the fee 
changes effective May 1, 2024.
---------------------------------------------------------------------------

    \3\ A MPL Order is a limit order that is not displayed and does 
not route, with a working price at the midpoint of the Protected 
Best Bid/Offer. See NYSE Arca Rule 7.31-E(d)(3).
---------------------------------------------------------------------------

Background
    The Exchange operates in a highly competitive market. The 
Commission has repeatedly expressed its preference for competition over 
regulatory intervention in determining prices, products, and services 
in the securities markets. In Regulation NMS, the Commission 
highlighted the importance of market forces in determining prices and 
SRO revenues and, also, recognized that current regulation of the 
market system ``has been remarkably successful in promoting market 
competition in its broader forms that are most important to investors 
and listed companies.'' \4\
---------------------------------------------------------------------------

    \4\ See Securities Exchange Act Release No. 51808 (June 9, 
2005), 70 FR 37496, 37499 (June 29, 2005) (File No. S7-10-04) (Final 
Rule) (``Regulation NMS'').
---------------------------------------------------------------------------

    While Regulation NMS has enhanced competition, it has also fostered 
a ``fragmented'' market structure where trading in a single stock can 
occur across multiple trading centers. When multiple trading centers 
compete for order flow in the same stock, the Commission has recognized 
that ``such competition can lead to the fragmentation of order flow in 
that stock.'' \5\ Indeed, equity trading is currently dispersed across 
16 exchanges,\6\ numerous alternative trading systems,\7\ and broker-
dealer internalizers and wholesalers, all competing for order flow. 
Based on publicly available information, no single exchange currently 
has more than 20% market share.\8\ Therefore, no exchange possesses 
significant pricing power in the execution of equity order flow. More 
specifically, the Exchange currently has less than 12% market share of 
executed volume of equities trading.\9\
---------------------------------------------------------------------------

---------------------------------------------------------------------------

    The Exchange believes that the ever-shifting market share among the 
exchanges from month to month demonstrates that market participants can 
move order flow, or discontinue or reduce use of certain categories of 
products. While it is not possible to know a firm's reason for shifting 
order flow, the Exchange believes that one such reason is because of 
fee changes at any of the registered exchanges or non-exchange venues 
to which the firm routes order flow. Accordingly, competitive forces 
compel the Exchange to use exchange transaction fees and credits 
because market participants can readily trade on competing venues if 
they deem pricing levels at those other venues to be more favorable.
Proposed Rule Change
    In response to this competitive environment, the Exchange has 
already established multiple levels of credits for MPL Orders that 
allow ETP Holders to passively interact with trading interest on the 
Exchange and offer potential price improvement to incoming marketable 
orders submitted to the Exchange.\10\ In order to provide an incentive 
for ETP Holders to provide such liquidity, the credits increase based 
on increased levels of volume directed to the Exchange. The MPL Order 
pricing tiers are intended to incentivize ETP Holders to earn increased 
credits by sending greater amounts of liquidity-providing MPL Orders in 
Tapes A, B and C securities to the Exchange.
---------------------------------------------------------------------------

    \10\ See, e.g., Securities Exchange Act Release No. 54511 
(September 26, 2006), 71 FR 58460, 58461 (October 3, 2006) (SR-PCX-
2005-53).
---------------------------------------------------------------------------

    As noted above, the Exchange currently provides multiple levels of 
credits, ranging from $0.0015 per share to $0.0028 per share, to ETP 
Holders that send MPL Orders that provide liquidity to the Exchange. 
For the current MPL Order pricing tier, the amount of the per share 
credit is based on an ETP Holder's ADV of provided liquidity in MPL 
Orders for Tape A, Tape B and Tape C Securities combined (``MPL Adding 
ADV'').
    Under current MPL Tier 6, for ETP Holders that have MPL Adding ADV 
during a billing month of at least 1.5 million shares, the Exchange 
currently

[[Page 42549]]

provides a credit of $0.0015 per share in Tape A, Tape B and Tape C 
securities. Under current MPL Tier 5, for ETP Holders with MPL Adding 
ADV during a billing month of at least 2 million shares, the Exchange 
currently provides a credit of $0.0020 per share in Tape A, Tape B and 
Tape C securities. Under current MPL Tier 4, the Exchange provides a 
credit of $0.0025 per share in Tape A, Tape B and Tape C securities to 
ETP Holders that have MPL Adding ADV during a billing month of at least 
3 million shares. ETP Holders can alternatively qualify for the MPL 
Tier 4 credit if they have MPL Adding ADV during the billing month of 
at least 1 million shares and have MPL Adding ADV, as a percent of 
Adding ADV, of at least 50%. Under current MPL Tier 3, the Exchange 
provides a credit of $0.0026 per share in Tape A, Tape B and Tape C 
securities to ETP Holders that have MPL Adding ADV during a billing 
month of at least 5 million shares. ETP Holders can alternatively 
qualify for the MPL Tier 3 credit if they have MPL Adding ADV during 
the billing month of at least 2 million shares and have MPL Adding ADV, 
as a percent of Adding ADV, of at least 50%. Under MPL Tier 2, for ETP 
Holders with MPL Adding ADV during a billing month of at least 13 
million shares, the Exchange currently provides a credit of $0.0027 per 
share in Tape A, Tape B and Tape C securities. Finally, under MPL Tier 
1, for ETP Holders with MPL Adding ADV during a billing month of at 
least 15 million shares, the Exchange currently provides a credit of 
$0.0028 per share in Tape A, Tape B and Tape C securities.\11\
---------------------------------------------------------------------------

    \11\ The Exchange charges a fee of $0.0030 per share for MPL 
Orders in Tape A, Tape B and Tape C Securities that remove liquidity 
from the Exchange that are not designated as ``Retail Orders.'' MPL 
Orders removing liquidity from the Exchange that are designated as 
Retail Orders are subject to a fee of $0.0010 per share. See Fee 
Schedule.
---------------------------------------------------------------------------

    The Exchange now proposes to adopt new MPL Order pricing tiers, MPL 
Tiers 1 and 2. Under proposed new MPL Tier 1, the Exchange would 
provide a credit of $0.0030 per share in Tape A, Tape B and Tape C 
securities to ETP Holders that have MPL Adding ADV during a billing 
month of at least 30 million shares.
    Next, under proposed new MPL Tier 2, the Exchange would provide a 
credit of $0.0029 per share in Tape A, Tape B and Tape C securities to 
ETP Holders that have MPL Adding ADV during a billing month of at least 
25 million shares.
    Finally, in connection with the proposed addition of new MPL Tiers 
1 and 2, the Exchange proposes to rename current MPL Tier 1, MPL Tier 
2, MPL Tier 3, MPL Tier 4, MPL Tier 5 and MPL Tier 6 as MPL Tier 3, MPL 
Tier 4, MPL Tier 5, MPL Tier 6, MPL Tier 7 and MPL Tier 8, 
respectively, without any change to the volume requirements or credits 
payable under each of the pricing tiers.
    With this proposed change, the MPL Order Tiers pricing tier would 
appear as follows:

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
                                                                                            MPL order tiers
                                             -----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
                                                                   Minimum Requirement                                  Credit for MPL adding

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

    The goal of the proposed rule change is to incentivize ETP Holders 
with higher per share credits to increase the number of MPL Orders they 
post on the Exchange's Book, which would provide additional price 
improvement opportunities for incoming orders. MPL Orders allow for 
additional opportunities for passive interaction with trading interest 
on the Exchange and are designed to offer potential price improvement 
to incoming marketable orders submitted to the Exchange. The Exchange 
believes that by correlating the level of the credit to the level of 
MPL Adding ADV, the Exchange's fee structure would incentivize ETP 
Holders to submit more liquidity-providing MPL Orders to the Exchange, 
thereby increasing the potential for price improvement to incoming 
marketable orders submitted to the Exchange.
    The Exchange believes adopting increased credits payable under the 
proposed MPL Tiers 1 and 2 would provide an incentive for ETP Holders 
to send increased order flow to qualify for these tiers. As noted 
above, the Exchange operates in a competitive environment, particularly 
as it relates to attracting MPL Orders that are posted on the 
Exchange's Book. Because each of the proposed MPL Tiers 1 and 2 pricing 
tiers would require ETP Holders to provide increased liquidity, the 
Exchange believes that the proposed higher credits would incentivize 
ETP Holders to route additional liquidity-providing orders to the 
Exchange to qualify for the proposed pricing tiers.
    The Exchange does not know how much order flow ETP Holders choose 
to route to other exchanges or to off-exchange venues. Without having a 
view of ETP Holders' activity on other markets and off-exchange venues, 
the Exchange has no way of knowing whether the proposed new pricing 
tiers would result in any ETP Holders sending more of their liquidity-
providing orders to the Exchange to qualify for the proposed new 
credits. The Exchange cannot predict with certainty how many ETP 
Holders would avail themselves of this opportunity, but additional 
liquidity-providing orders would benefit all market participants 
because it would provide greater execution opportunities on the 
Exchange. The Exchange believes the proposed higher credits would 
provide an incentive for ETP Holders to submit additional MPL Orders to 
the Exchange to qualify for such credits.
    As noted above, the Exchange operates in a competitive environment,

[[Page 42550]]

particularly as it relates to attracting non-marketable, providing 
liquidity that would be displayed on the Exchange. The proposed rule 
change is designed to incentivize ETP Holders to increase the orders 
sent to the Exchange that would provide displayed liquidity, which 
would support the quality of price discovery and transparency on the 
Exchange. The Exchange believes that by correlating the level of the 
credit to the level of executed providing volume on the Exchange, the 
Exchange's fee structure would incentivize ETP Holders to submit more 
displayed, liquidity-providing orders to the Exchange that are likely 
to be executed (i.e., are not orders that are intended to be displayed, 
but are priced such that they are not likely to be executed), thereby 
increasing the potential for incoming marketable orders submitted to 
the Exchange to receive an execution.
    The proposed changes are not otherwise intended to address any 
other issues, and the Exchange is not aware of any significant problems 
that market participants would have in complying with the proposed 
changes.
2. Statutory Basis
    The Exchange believes that the proposed rule change is consistent 
with Section 6(b) of the Act,\12\ in general, and furthers the 
objectives of Sections 6(b)(4) and (5) of the Act,\13\ in particular, 
because it provides for the equitable allocation of reasonable dues, 
fees, and other charges among its members, issuers and other persons 
using its facilities and does not unfairly discriminate between 
customers, issuers, brokers or dealers.

The Proposed Fee Change Is Reasonable
    As discussed above, the Exchange operates in a highly fragmented 
and competitive market. The Commission has repeatedly expressed its 
preference for competition over regulatory intervention in determining 
prices, products, and services in the securities markets. Specifically, 
in Regulation NMS, the Commission highlighted the importance of market 
forces in determining prices and SRO revenues and, also, recognized 
that current regulation of the market system ``has been remarkably 
successful in promoting market competition in its broader forms that 
are most important to investors and listed companies.'' \14\
---------------------------------------------------------------------------

    \14\ See Regulation NMS, supra note 5, 70 FR at 37499.
---------------------------------------------------------------------------

    As the Commission itself recognized, the market for trading 
services in NMS stocks has become ``more fragmented and competitive.'' 
\15\ Indeed, equity trading is currently dispersed across 16 
exchanges,\16\ numerous alternative trading systems,\17\ and broker-
dealer internalizers and wholesalers, all competing for order flow. 
Based on publicly-available information, no single exchange currently 
has more than 20% market share (whether including or excluding auction 
volume).\18\ The Exchange believes that the ever-shifting market share 
among the exchanges from month to month demonstrates that market 
participants can shift order flow, or discontinue or reduce use of 
certain categories of products, in response to fee changes. 
Accordingly, the Exchange's fees are reasonably constrained by 
competitive alternatives and market participants can readily trade on 
competing venues if they deem pricing levels at those other venues to 
be more favorable.

---------------------------------------------------------------------------

    The Exchange believes the proposed changes to the MPL Order pricing 
tiers, including the adoption of new MPL Tier 1 and MPL Tier 2 is 
reasonable because the increased credits under the proposed MPL Tier 1 
and MPL Tier 2 would provide an incentive for ETP Holders to route 
greater amounts of liquidity-providing orders to the Exchange. As noted 
above, the Exchange operates in a highly competitive environment, 
particularly for attracting order flow that provides liquidity on an 
exchange. The Exchange believes it is reasonable to provide the higher 
credits under the proposed MPL Tier 1 and MPL Tier 2 for orders that 
provide liquidity if an ETP Holder meets the qualification for such 
pricing tiers.
    Because the proposed MPL Tier 1 and MPL Tier 2 would be new with a 
requirement to submit greater amounts of MPL Adding ADV, no ETP Holder 
currently qualifies for the proposed new pricing tiers. The Exchange 
believes the proposed increased credits are reasonable as they would 
provide an additional incentive for ETP Holders to qualify for these 
new tiers and direct their order flow to the Exchange and provide 
meaningful added levels of liquidity, thereby contributing to the depth 
and market quality on the Exchange.
    On the backdrop of the competitive environment in which the 
Exchange currently operates, the proposed rule change is a reasonable 
attempt by the Exchange to increase its liquidity and improve its 
market share relative to its competitors.
The Proposed Fee Change Is an Equitable Allocation of Credits and Fees
    The Exchange believes the proposed fee change is an equitable 
allocation of its fees and credits. The Exchange believes that the 
adoption of increased credits under proposed MPL Tier 1 and MPL Tier 2 
pricing tiers is equitable because the magnitude of the additional 
credit is not unreasonably high in comparison to the credit paid with 
respect to other pricing tiers on the Exchange, and in comparison to 
the credits paid by other exchanges for orders that provide midpoint 
liquidity. For example, ETP Holders currently receive credits in Tape 
A, Tape B and Tape C securities that range between $0.0010 per share 
and $0.0038 per share under Standard and Tiered rates. With respect to 
credits paid by the Exchange's competitors, the Nasdaq Stock Market LLC 
provides a credit of $0.0025 per share to add non-displayed midpoint 
liquidity in Tape A, Tape B and Tape C Securities on that market for 
members that add greater than 5 million shares of midpoint liquidity 
and add 8 million shares on non-displayed liquidity.\19\
---------------------------------------------------------------------------

    \19\ See Rebate to Add Non-Displayed Midpoint Liquidity, at 
<a href="http://nasdaqtrader.com/Trader.aspx?id=PriceListTrading2">http://nasdaqtrader.com/Trader.aspx?id=PriceListTrading2</a>.
---------------------------------------------------------------------------

    NYSE American LLC, an affiliate of the Exchange, currently provides 
a credit of $0.0030 per share to add MPL liquidity on that market for 
members that add greater than 3.5 million shares.\20\
---------------------------------------------------------------------------

    \20\ See Standard Rates under I. Transaction Fees (other than 
for Transactions by an eDMM in Securities Assigned to an eDMM), at

---------------------------------------------------------------------------

    The Exchange believes the proposed rule change would improve market 
quality for all market participants on the Exchange and, as a 
consequence, attract more liquidity to the Exchange thereby improving 
market-wide quality. ETP Holders that currently qualify for credits 
associated with MPL Orders will continue to receive credits when they 
provide liquidity to the Exchange. With the proposed new MPL Tier 1 and 
MPL Tier 2, all ETP Holders would be eligible to qualify for the higher 
credit if they increase their MPL Adding ADV.

[[Page 42551]]

The Exchange believes that recalibrating the credits for providing 
liquidity will continue to attract order flow and liquidity to the 
Exchange, thereby providing additional price improvement opportunities 
on the Exchange and benefiting investors generally. As to those market 
participants that do not presently qualify for the credits associated 
with MPL Orders, the proposal will not adversely impact their existing 
pricing or their ability to qualify for other credits provided by the 
Exchange.
The Proposed Fee Change Is not Unfairly Discriminatory
    The Exchange believes that the proposal is not unfairly 
discriminatory. Moreover, this proposed rule change neither targets nor 
will it have a disparate impact on any particular category of market 
participant. The Exchange believes it is not unfairly discriminatory to 
provide the increased per share credits under proposed MPL Tier 1 and 
MPL Tier 2 as each such credit would be provided on an equal basis to 
all ETP Holders that add liquidity by meeting the requirements of the 
proposed new MPL Order pricing tiers. The Exchange believes the 
proposed increased per share credits would incentivize ETP Holders that 
meet the current tiered requirements to send more of their MPL Orders 
to the Exchange to qualify for such credits. The Exchange also believes 
that the proposed changes are not unfairly discriminatory because they 
are reasonably related to the value of the Exchange's market quality 
associated with higher volume. The proposed higher credits would apply 
equally to all ETP Holders as each would be required to provide 
liquidity in MPL Orders for Tape A, Tape B and Tape C Securities 
combined during the billing month regardless of whether an ETP Holder 
currently meets the requirement of another pricing tier.
    Finally, the submission of orders to the Exchange is optional for 
ETP Holders in that they could choose whether to submit orders to the 
Exchange and, if they do, the extent of its activity in this regard. 
The Exchange believes that it is subject to significant competitive 
forces, as described below in the Exchange's statement regarding the 
burden on competition.
    For the foregoing reasons, the Exchange believes that the proposal 
is consistent with the Act.

B. Self-Regulatory Organization's Statement on Burden on Competition

    In accordance with Section 6(b)(8) of the Act,\21\ the Exchange 
believes that the proposed rule change would not impose any burden on 
competition that is not necessary or appropriate in furtherance of the 
purposes of the Act. Instead, as discussed above, the Exchange believes 
that the proposed changes would encourage the submission of additional 
liquidity to a public exchange, thereby promoting market depth, price 
discovery and transparency and enhancing order execution opportunities 
for ETP Holders. As a result, the Exchange believes that the proposed 
change furthers the Commission's goal in adopting Regulation NMS of 
fostering integrated competition among orders, which promotes ``more 
efficient pricing of individual stocks for all types of orders, large 
and small.'' \22\
---------------------------------------------------------------------------

    \22\ See Regulation NMS, supra note 5, 70 FR at 37498-99.
---------------------------------------------------------------------------

    Intramarket Competition. The proposed changes are designed to 
attract additional order flow to the Exchange. The Exchange believes 
that the adoption of higher credits under proposed MPL Tier 1 and MPL 
Tier 2, would continue to incentivize market participants to direct 
more orders to the Exchange, and in particular, liquidity-providing MPL 
Orders. Greater liquidity benefits all market participants on the 
Exchange by providing more trading opportunities. The proposed changes 
to the MPL Order pricing tier should incentivize ETP Holders to send 
liquidity-providing orders to the Exchange, thereby contributing to 
robust levels of liquidity, which would benefit all market participants 
on the Exchange. The proposed new credits would be available to all 
similarly-situated market participants, and, as such, the proposed 
changes would not impose a disparate burden on competition among market 
participants on the Exchange.
    Intermarket Competition. The Exchange operates in a highly 
competitive market in which market participants can readily choose to 
send their orders to other exchange and off-exchange venues if they 
deem fee levels at those other venues to be more favorable. As noted 
above, the Exchange's market share of intraday trading (i.e., excluding 
auctions) is currently less than 12%. In such an environment, the 
Exchange must continually review, and consider adjusting its fees and 
rebates to remain competitive with other exchanges and with off-
exchange venues. Because competitors are free to modify their own fees 
and credits in response, the Exchange does not believe its proposed fee 
change can impose any burden on intermarket competition.
    The Exchange believes that the proposed changes could promote 
competition between the Exchange and other execution venues, including 
those that currently offer similar order types and comparable 
transaction pricing, by encouraging additional orders to be sent to the 
Exchange for execution.
