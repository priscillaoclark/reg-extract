emergency to address grave acts of terrorism and threats of terrorism 
committed by foreign terrorists, including the September 11, 2001 
terrorist attacks in New York, Pennsylvania, and at the Pentagon. The 
Order imposes economic sanctions on persons who have committed, pose a 
significant risk of committing, or support acts of terrorism. The 
President identified in the Annex to the Order, as amended by Executive 
Order 13268 of July 2, 2002, 13 individuals and 16 entities as subject 
to the economic sanctions. The Order was further amended by Executive

policy, or economy of the United States; (3) persons determined by the 
Director of OFAC, in consultation with the Departments of State, 
Homeland Security and Justice, to be owned or controlled by, or to act

1(d)(i) of the Order; and (4) except as provided in section 5 of the 
Order and after such consultation, if any, with foreign authorities as

persons determined by the Director of OFAC, in consultation with the 
Departments of State, Homeland Security and Justice, to assist in,
