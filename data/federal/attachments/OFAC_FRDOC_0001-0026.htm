SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION: The current procedures used by OFAC for 
authorizing the export of agricultural commodities, medicine, and 
medical devices to Sudan and Iran are set forth in 31 CFR 538.523-526 
and 31 CFR 560.530-533. Under the provisions of section 906(c) of the 
Act, OFAC must submit a biennial report to the Congress on the 
operation, during the preceding two-year period, of the licensing 
procedures required by section 906 of the Act for the export of 
agricultural commodities, medicine, and medical devices to Sudan and 
Iran. This report is to include:
    (1) The number and types of licenses applied for;
    (2) The number and types of licenses approved;
    (3) The average amount of time elapsed from the date of filing of a 
license application until the date of its approval;
    (4) The extent to which the licensing procedures were effectively 
implemented; and
    (5) A description of comments received from interested parties 
about the extent to which the licensing procedures were effective, 
after holding a public 30-day comment period.
    This notice solicits comments from interested parties regarding the 
effectiveness of OFAC's licensing procedures for the export of 
agricultural commodities, medicine, and medical devices to Sudan and 
Iran. Interested parties submitting comments are asked to be as 
specific as possible. All comments received on or before December 17, 
2008 will be considered by OFAC in developing the report to the 
Congress. In the interest of accuracy and completeness, OFAC requires 
written comments. Comments received after the end of the comment period 
will be considered, if possible, but their consideration cannot be 
assured. OFAC will not accept comments accompanied by a request that 
part or all of the comments be treated confidentially because of their 
business proprietary nature or for any other reason. OFAC will return 
such comments when submitted by regular mail to the person submitting 
the comments and will not consider them. All comments made will be a 
matter of public record. Copies of the public record concerning these 
regulations may be obtained from OFAC's Web site (<A HREF="http://frwebgate.access.gpo.gov/cgi-bin/leaving.cgi?from=leavingFR.html&log=linklog&to=http://www.treas.gov/ofac">http://www.treas.gov/
