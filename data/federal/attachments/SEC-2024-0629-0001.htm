``Exchange'') filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission 
(``Commission''), pursuant to section 19(b)(1) of the Securities 
Exchange Act of 1934 (``Act'') \1\ and Rule 19b-4 thereunder,\2\ a 
proposed rule change to amend its Designated Market Maker (``DMM'') 
program. The proposed rule change was published for comment in the 
Federal Register on November 13, 2023.\3\
---------------------------------------------------------------------------

    \1\ 15 U.S.C. 78s(b)(1).

---------------------------------------------------------------------------

    On December 13, 2023, pursuant to section 19(b)(2) of the Act,\4\ 
the Commission designated a longer period within which to approve the 
proposed rule change, disapprove the proposed rule change, or institute 
proceedings to determine whether to disapprove the proposed rule 
change.\5\ On February 9, 2024, the Commission instituted proceedings 
under section 19(b)(2)(B) of the Act \6\ to determine whether to 
approve or disapprove the proposed rule change.\7\
---------------------------------------------------------------------------

    \4\ 15 U.S.C. 78s(b)(2).
    \5\ See Securities Exchange Act Release No. 99161 (December 13,

    \7\ See Securities Exchange Act Release No. 99511, 89 FR 11893 
(Feb. 15, 2024).
---------------------------------------------------------------------------

    Section 19(b)(2) of the Act \8\ provides that, after initiating 
proceedings, the Commission shall issue an order approving or 
disapproving the proposed rule change not later than 180 days after the 
date of publication of notice of filing of the proposed rule change. 
The Commission may extend the period for issuing an order approving or 
disapproving the proposed rule change, however, by not more than 60 
days if the Commission determines that a longer period is appropriate 
and publishes the reasons for such determination. The proposed rule 
change was published for comment in the Federal Register on November 
13, 2023.\9\ The 180th day after publication of the proposed rule 
change is May 11, 2024. The Commission is extending the time period for 
approving or disapproving the proposed rule change for an additional 60 
days.

    \8\ 15 U.S.C. 78s(b)(2).
    \9\ See supra note 3 and accompanying text.
---------------------------------------------------------------------------

    The Commission finds that it is appropriate to designate a longer 
period within which to issue an order approving or disapproving the 
proposed rule change so that it has sufficient time to consider the 
proposed rule change and the issues raised therein. Accordingly, the 
Commission, pursuant to Section 19(b)(2) of the Act,\10\ designates 
July 10, 2024, as the date by which the Commission shall either approve 
or disapprove the proposed rule change (File No. SR-NYSE-2023-36).
