determining whether to approve a collection of information, the Board 
will consider all comments received from the public and other agencies.
    During the comment period for this proposal, a copy of the proposed 
PRA OMB submission, including the draft reporting form and 
instructions, supporting statement (which contains more detail about 
the information collection and burden estimates than this notice), and 
other documentation, will be made available on the Board's public

Request for Comment on Information Collection Proposal

    The Board invites public comment on the following information 
collection, which is being reviewed under authority delegated by the 
OMB under the PRA. Comments are invited on the following:
    a. Whether the proposed collection of information is necessary for 
the proper performance of the Board's functions, including whether the 
information has practical utility;
    b. The accuracy of the Board's estimate of the burden of the 
proposed information collection, including the validity of the 
methodology and assumptions used;
    c. Ways to enhance the quality, utility, and clarity of the 
information to be collected;
    d. Ways to minimize the burden of information collection on 
respondents, including through the use of automated collection 
techniques or other forms of information technology; and
    e. Estimates of capital or startup costs and costs of operation, 
maintenance, and purchase of services to provide information.
    At the end of the comment period, the comments and recommendations 
received will be analyzed to determine the extent to which the Board 
should modify the proposal.

Proposal Under OMB Delegated Authority To Extend for Three Years, With 
Revision, the Following Information Collection

    Collection title: Application Form for Membership on the Community 
Advisory Council.
    Collection identifier: FR 1401.
    OMB control number: 7100-0371.
    General description of collection: The Application Form for 
Membership on the Community Advisory Council (Application) is used to 
obtain information about the experience and qualification of persons 
seeking to be considered for membership on the Board's Community 
Advisory Council (CAC). The Application collects an applicant's contact 
information; details regarding current employment and areas of 
expertise; a resume, which typically includes information about 
employment history, education, and training; and a cover letter 
explaining why the applicant is interested in serving on the CAC and 
their primary qualifications. Applicants can voluntarily elect to 
provide additional information to support their application.
    Proposed revisions: The Board proposes to modify the choices for 
the organization type, add choices for the areas of expertise on the 
application, and add two attestations. Organization type would now 
require a response should an applicant choose ``Other'' under non-
profit or for-profit agencies. Additional subcategories under the 
government option would include ``National,'' ``State,'' and ``Local.'' 
The four additional choices for primary and secondary areas of 
expertise would include ``Artificial Intelligence,'' ``Disaster 
Recovery and Resiliency,'' ``Financial Education,'' and ``Health.'' The 
application would have two attestations: (1) affirming there is no 
applicant relationship to an employee of the Board of Governors, 
Reserve Bank, or a Board or Reserve Bank advisory council, and (2) that 
no officer or senior executive of the applicant's current organization 
has a relationship to an employee of the Board of Governors, Reserve 
Bank, or a Board or Reserve Bank advisory council. If there is a 
relationship, applicants would be asked to disclose the name of the 
employee, director, advisory council member, officer, or senior 
executive with the relationship to the applicant. Applicants would be 
asked to indicate the nature of the relationship and whether the 
employee, director, advisory council member, officer, or senior 
executive is or was associated with the Board or a Reserve Bank and if 
at a Reserve Bank, indicate which one. Revisions would be effective as 
of the 2025 application period.
    Frequency: Annual.
    Respondents: Individuals seeking to be considered for membership on 
the CAC.
    Total estimated number of respondents: 300.
    Total estimated change in burden: 23.

[[Page 79590]]

    Total estimated annual burden hours: 323.

    Board of Governors of the Federal Reserve System, September 25, 
2024.
Benjamin W. McDonough,
Deputy Secretary and Ombuds of the Board.
