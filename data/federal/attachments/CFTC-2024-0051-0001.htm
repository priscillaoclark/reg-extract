SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION: 
    Title: Reparations Complaint, CFTC Form 30 (OMB Control No. 3038-
0115). This is a request for extension of a currently approved 
information collection.
    Abstract: Pursuant to section 14 of the Commodity Exchange Act, 
members of the public may apply to the Commission to seek damages 
against Commission registrants for alleged violations of the Act and/or 
Commission regulations. The legislative intent of the Reparations 
program was to provide a low-cost, speedy, and effective forum for the 
resolution of customer complaints and to sanction individuals and firms 
found to have violated the Act and/or any regulations.
    In 1984, the Commission promulgated part 12 of the Commission 
regulations to administer section 14. Rule 12.13 provides the standards 
and procedures for filing a Reparations complaint. Specifically, 
paragraph (b) describes the form and content requirements of a 
complaint. CFTC Form 30 mirrors the requirements set forth in paragraph 
(b).
    The Commission began utilizing Form 30 in or about 1984. The form 
was created to assist customers, who are typically pro se and non-
lawyers. It was also designed as a way to provide proper notice to 
respondents of the charges against them. This form is critical to 
fulfilling this policy goal.\1\
---------------------------------------------------------------------------

    \1\ The Commission plans to update its rules to include a web-
based version of Form 30 as an additional option for the public to 
submit reparations complaints online.
---------------------------------------------------------------------------

    An agency may not conduct or sponsor, and a person is not required 
to respond to, a collection of information unless it displays a 
currently valid OMB control number.\2\ On May 1, 2024, the Commission 
published in the Federal Register notice of the proposed extension of 
an approved collection of information and provided 60 days for public 
comment on the proposed extension, 89 FR 35078 (``60-Day Notice'') The 
Commission did not receive any relevant comments on the 60-Day Notice.
---------------------------------------------------------------------------

    \2\ 44 U.S.C. 3512, 5 CFR 1320.5(b)(2)(i) and 1320.8 (b)(3)(vi). 
See also 46 FR 63035 (Dec. 30, 1981).
