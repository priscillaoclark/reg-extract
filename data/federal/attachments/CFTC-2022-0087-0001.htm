SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION: The Infrastructure Subcommittee was 
established to provide a report to the EEMAC that will evaluate what is 
required to ensure the energy markets in the United States remain 
resilient despite the numerous strains on the system globally. Topics 
and issues this subcommittee may consider in this regard include, but 
are not limited to, the following:
    <bullet> Given the importance of predictable supply and reliable 
distribution of energy to effective energy derivatives markets, 
identifying the state of infrastructure of various energy markets, 
including but not limited to, oil, natural gas, and electricity, and 
examining how investment in infrastructure in recent years has 
contributed to the current state of infrastructure;
    <bullet> Examining how the current state of energy infrastructure 
has impacted market fundamentals, such as supply and demand, price 
discovery, price volatility, and market participation;
    <bullet> Identifying key issues facing energy derivatives markets 
that are related to or a result of energy market fundamentals and 
dynamics; and
    <bullet> Examining if and how financial regulation can address 
current issues in the energy derivatives markets.
    The Metals Market Subcommittee was established to provide a report 
to the EEMAC to examine the role of critical metals in transitional 
energy sources and their potential impact on derivatives markets. 
Within this charge, this subcommittee may consider, but is not limited 
to, the following issues and topics:
    <bullet> Identifying metals that are used as components in 
transitional energy sources and their related derivatives markets, or 
lack thereof;
    <bullet> Examining how the increased demand for certain metals 
impact existing derivatives markets;
    <bullet> Examining the issues around creating new derivatives 
markets for metals that will be integral in transitional energy; and
    <bullet> Examining if and how financial regulation should change 
given the increased demand on and need for metals derivatives markets.
    The subcommittees will provide their reports directly to the EEMAC 
and will not provide their reports directly to the Commission. The 
subcommittees have no authority to make decisions on behalf of the 
EEMAC, and no determination of fact or policy will be made by the 
subcommittees on behalf of the Commission.
    Subcommittee members will generally serve as representatives and 
provide advice reflecting the views of diverse stakeholder 
organizations and entities within the derivatives and financial 
markets. The subcommittees may also include regular government 
employees when doing so furthers their purposes. It is anticipated that 
the subcommittees will hold at least three in-person or telephonic 
meetings. Subcommittee members serve at the pleasure of the Commission. 
Subcommittee members do not receive compensation or honoraria for their 
services, and they are not reimbursed for travel and per diem expenses.
    Subcommittee members will include individuals who are Members or 
Associate Members of the EEMAC and/or other individuals. For these 
other individuals, the Commission seeks nominations of individuals from 
a wide range of perspectives, including from industry, academia, the 
government, and public interest. To advise the EEMAC effectively, 
subcommittee members must have a high level of expertise and experience 
with: the energy and/or metals markets, the Commodity Exchange Act, 
Commission regulations, and guidance thereunder. To the extent 
practicable, and consistent with these objectives, the Commission will 
strive to include members reflecting wide ethnic, racial, gender, and 
age representation.
    The Commission invites the submission of nominations for membership 
on the subcommittees. Each nomination submission should include the 
proposed member's name, title, organization affiliation, address, email 
address, and telephone number, as well as information that supports the 
individual's qualifications to serve on a subcommittee. The submission 
should also include the name, email address, and telephone number of 
the person nominating the proposed subcommittee member. Self-
nominations are acceptable.
    Submission of a nomination is not a guarantee of selection as a 
member of a subcommittee. The Commission will identify members for the 
subcommittees based on Commissioners' and Commission staff's 
professional knowledge of the energy and metals markets, consultation 
with knowledgeable persons outside of the CFTC, and requests received 
from organizations. The Commission, by vote, will authorize members to 
serve on the subcommittees.
    Authority: 5 U.S.C. app. II.
