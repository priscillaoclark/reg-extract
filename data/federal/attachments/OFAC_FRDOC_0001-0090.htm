The persons listed in an Annex to the Order; (2) any foreign person 
determined by the Secretary of Treasury, in consultation with the 
Attorney General and Secretary of State: (a) To play a significant role 
in international narcotics trafficking centered in Colombia; or (b) to 
materially assist in, or provide financial or technological support for 
or goods or services in support of, the narcotics trafficking 
activities of persons designated in or pursuant to the Order; and (3) 
persons determined by the Secretary of the Treasury, in consultation 
with the Attorney General and the Secretary of State, to be owned or
