SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION:

I. Background and Public Meeting Notice

    On March 21, 2024, Capital One, National Association, McLean, 
Virginia (Capital One Bank), applied to the OCC to merge Discover Bank, 
Greenwood, Delaware, with and into Capital One Bank pursuant to section 
18(c) of the Federal Deposit Insurance Act (12 U.S.C. 1828(c)) (Bank 
Application). On March 21, 2024, the Board received an application from 
Capital One Financial Corporation (Capital One), McLean, Virginia, to 
acquire Discover Financial Services, Riverwoods, Illinois, parent of 
Discover Bank, pursuant to section 3 of the Bank Holding Company Act 
(12 U.S.C. 1842) (Section 3 Application) and a notice from Capital One 
to acquire certain nonbanking companies pursuant to sections 4(c)(8) 
and 4(j) of the Bank Holding Company Act (12 U.S.C. 1843(c)(8) and 
1843(j)) (Section 4 Notice, and together with the Section 3 
Application, Holding Company Filings).\1\ The Board and OCC (agencies) 
hereby announce that a public meeting on the Bank Application and the 
Holding Company Filings (together, the applications) will be held, as 
described below.
---------------------------------------------------------------------------

    \1\ As of the date of publication of this notice, these 
nonbanking companies are: DFS Services LLC, Riverwoods, Illinois; 
Discover Financial Services (Canada), Inc., Vancouver, British 
Columbia, Canada; PULSE Network LLC, Houston, Texas; and Diners Club 
International Ltd., Riverwoods, Illinois (collectively, Nonbanking 
Companies).
---------------------------------------------------------------------------

II. Purpose and Procedures

    The public meeting will be held virtually. The virtual format will 
expand public access to the proceedings for both viewers and those who 
testify, and it will reduce travel and related costs associated with 
attending in-person proceedings.
    The purpose of the public meeting is to collect information 
relating to the factors that the agencies consider under the applicable 
statutes in acting on the applications. These factors include the 
effects of the proposal on the convenience and needs of the communities 
to be served by the combined organization; the insured depository 
institutions' performance under the Community Reinvestment Act; the 
impact of the proposal on competition in the relevant markets; the 
effects of the proposal on the stability of the U.S. banking or 
financial system; the financial and managerial resources and future 
prospects of the companies and banks involved in the proposal; and the 
effectiveness of the companies and banks in combatting money laundering 
activities. In addition, in acting on the Section 4 Notice, the Board 
considers whether the proposed acquisition of the Nonbanking Companies 
can reasonably be expected to produce benefits to the public, such as 
greater convenience, increased competition, or gains in efficiency, 
that outweigh possible adverse effects, such as undue concentration of 
resources, decreased or unfair competition, conflicts of interests, 
unsound banking practices, or risk to the stability of the United 
States banking or financial system. Witnesses may present oral 
testimony in support of the proposed transactions, in opposition to the 
proposed transactions, or without taking a position in support or 
opposition.
    Testimony at the public meeting will be presented virtually to a 
panel consisting of Presiding Officers and other panel members 
appointed by the Presiding Officers. The Presiding Officers will have 
the authority and discretion to ensure that the meeting proceeds in a 
fair and orderly manner.

[[Page 43853]]

The rules for taking evidence in an administrative proceeding will not 
apply to the public meeting. In general, the role of the panel members 
will be to listen to the oral testimony. The panel members may ask 
questions of those who testify; however, the questions generally will 
be limited to seeking clarification of statements made. Panel members 
may question witnesses, but no cross-examination of witnesses will be 
permitted. The public meeting will be transcribed, and the transcript 
will be posted on the respective public websites of the Board and the 
OCC.\2\
