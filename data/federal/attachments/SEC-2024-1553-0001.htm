disapproving the proposed rule change, however, by not more than 60 
days if the Commission determines that a longer period is appropriate

change was published for notice and comment in the Federal Register on 
May 7, 2024.\8\ November 3, 2024 is 180 days from that date, and

    The Commission finds it is appropriate to designate a longer period 
within which to issue an order approving or disapproving the proposed 
rule change so that it has sufficient time to consider the proposed 
rule change and its comments. Accordingly, the Commission, pursuant to 
Section 19(b)(2) of the Act,\9\ designates January 2, 2025 as the date 
by which the Commission shall either approve or
