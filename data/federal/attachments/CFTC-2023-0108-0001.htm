SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION: Under the PRA, Federal agencies must obtain 
approval from the Office of Management and Budget (OMB) for each 
collection of information they conduct or sponsor. ``Collection of 
Information'' is defined in 44 U.S.C. 3502(3) and 5 CFR 1320.3 and 
includes agency requests or requirements that members of the public 
submit reports, keep records, or provide information to a third party. 
Section 3506(c)(2)(A) of the PRA, 44 U.S.C. 3506(c)(2)(A), requires 
Federal agencies to provide a 60-day notice in the Federal Register 
concerning each proposed collection of information before submitting 
the collection to OMB for approval. To comply with this requirement, 
the CFTC is publishing notice of the proposed collection of information 
listed below. An agency may not conduct or sponsor, and a person is not 
required to respond to, a collection of information unless it displays 
a currently valid OMB control number.\1\
---------------------------------------------------------------------------

    \1\ 44 U.S.C. 3512, 5 CFR 1320.5(b)(2)(i) and 1320.8 (b)(3)(vi).
---------------------------------------------------------------------------

    Title: ``Copies of Crop and Market Information Reports,'' OMB 
Control No. 3038-0015. This is a request for extension of a currently 
approved information collection.
    Abstract: The information collected pursuant to this rule, 17 CFR 
1.40, is in the public interest and is necessary for market 
surveillance. Manipulation of commodity futures prices is a violation 
of the Commodity Exchange Act (Act). Section 9(a)(2) of the Act (7 
U.S.C. 13(a)(2)) prohibits the dissemination of false or misleading or 
knowingly inaccurate reports that affect or tend to affect the prices 
of commodities. In order to facilitate the enforcement of this 
provision, Commission regulation 1.40 requires that members of an 
exchange and FCMs provide upon request copies of any report published 
or given general circulation which concerns crop or market information 
that affects or tends to affect the price of any commodity.
    With respect to the following collection of information, the CFTC 
invites comments on:
    <bullet> Evaluate whether the proposed collection of information is 
necessary for the proper performance of the functions of the 
Commission, including whether the information will have a practical 
use;
    <bullet> Evaluate the accuracy of the Commission's estimate of the 
burden of the proposed collection of information, including the 
validity of the methodology and assumptions used;
    <bullet> Enhance the quality, usefulness, and clarity of the 
information to be collected; and
    <bullet> Minimize the burden of collection of information on those 
who are to respond, including through the use of appropriate automated 
electronic, mechanical, or other technological collection techniques or 
other forms of information technology; e.g., permitting electronic 
submission of responses.
    You should submit only information that you wish to make available 
publicly. If you wish the Commission to consider information that you 
believe is exempt from disclosure under the Freedom of Information Act, 
a petition for confidential treatment of the exempt information may be 
submitted according to the procedures established in Sec.  145.9 of the 
Commission's regulations.\2\
---------------------------------------------------------------------------

    \2\ 17 CFR 145.9.
---------------------------------------------------------------------------

    The Commission reserves the right, but shall have no obligation, to 
review, pre-screen, filter, redact, refuse, or remove any or all of 
your submission from <a href="https://www.cftc.gov">https://www.cftc.gov</a> that it may deem to be 
inappropriate for publication, such as obscene language. All 
submissions that have been redacted or removed that contain comments on 
the merits of the ICR will be retained in the public comment file and 
will be considered as required under the Administrative Procedure Act 
and other applicable laws, and may be accessible under the Freedom of 
Information Act.
    Burden statement: The burden for this collection is estimated to be 
as follows:
    Respondents/Affected Entities: Entities potentially affected by 
this action include future commission merchants (``FCMs'') and members 
of designated contract markets and swap execution facilities.
    <bullet> Estimated number of respondents/affected entities: 10.
    <bullet> Estimated annual hours per respondent/response: 0.17.
    <bullet> Estimated total annual burden: 1.7 hours.
    <bullet> Frequency of collection: On occasion.
    There are no capital costs or operating and maintenance costs 
associated with this collection.

(Authority: 44 U.S.C. 3501 et seq.)

    Dated: November 15, 2023.
Robert Sidman,
Deputy Secretary of the Commission.
