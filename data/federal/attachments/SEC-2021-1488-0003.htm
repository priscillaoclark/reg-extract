SECURITIES AND EXCHANGE COMMISSION

[SEC File No. 270-028, OMB Control No. 3235-0032]


Proposed Collection; Comment Request; Extension: Rule 17f-1(b)

Upon Written Request, Copies Available From: Securities and Exchange 
Commission, Office of FOIA Services, 100 F Street NE, Washington, DC 
20549-2736

    Notice is hereby given that pursuant to the Paperwork Reduction Act 
of 1995 (``PRA'') (44 U.S.C. 3501 et seq.), the Securities and Exchange 
Commission (``Commission'') is soliciting comments on the existing 
collection of information provided for in Rule 17f-1(b) (17 CFR 
240.17f-1(b)), under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 (15 U.S.C. 78a 
et seq.). The Commission plans to submit this existing collection of 
information to the Office of Management and Budget (``OMB'') for 
extension and approval.
    Under Rule 17f-1(b) under the Exchange Act, approximately 9,500 
entities in the securities industry are registered in the Lost and 
Stolen Securities Program (``Program''). Registration fulfills a 
statutory requirement that entities report and inquire about missing, 
lost, counterfeit, or stolen securities. Registration also allows 
entities in the securities industry to gain access to a confidential 
database that stores information for the Program.
    The Commission staff estimates that 4 new entities will register in 
the Program each year. The staff estimates that the average number of 
hours necessary to comply with Rule 17f-1(b) is one-half hour. 
Accordingly, the staff estimates that total annual burden for all 
participants is 2 hours (4 x one-half hour). The Commission staff 
estimates that compliance staff work at subject entities results in an 
internal cost of compliance, at an estimated hourly wage of $344, of 
$172 per year per entity (.5 hours x $344 per hour = $172 per year). 
Therefore, the aggregate annual internal cost of compliance is 
approximately $688 ($172 x 4= $688).
    Written comments are invited on: (a) whether the proposed 
collection of information is necessary for the proper performance of 
the functions of the Commission, including whether the information 
shall have practical utility; (b) the accuracy of the Commission's 
estimates of the burden of the proposed collection of information; (c) 
ways to enhance the quality, utility, and clarity of the information 
collected; and (d) ways to minimize the burden of the collection of 
information on respondents, including through the use of automated 
collection techniques or other forms of information technology. 
Consideration will be given to comments and suggestions submitted by 
November 22, 2024.
    An agency may not conduct or sponsor, and a person is not required 
to respond to, a collection of information under the PRA unless it 
displays a currently valid OMB control number.
    Please direct your written comments to: Austin Gerig, Director/
Chief Data Officer, Securities and Exchange Commission, c/o Oluwaseun 
Ajayi, 100 F Street NE, Washington, DC 20549, or send an email to:

Vanessa A. Countryman,
Secretary.
