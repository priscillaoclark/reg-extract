AGENCY: Export-Import Bank of the United States.

ACTION: Submission for OMB review and comments request.

-----------------------------------------------------------------------

of its continuing effort to reduce paperwork and respondent burden, 
invites the general public and other Federal Agencies to comment on the 
proposed information collection, as required by the Paperwork Reduction 
Act of 1995. This collection of information is necessary to determine 
eligibility of the applicant for EXIM assistance.

DATES: Comments must be received on or before November 29, 2021 to be 
assured of consideration.

ADDRESSES: Comments may be submitted electronically on 
WWW.REGULATIONS.GOV (EIB 10-02) or by email <a href="/cdn-cgi/l/email-protection#e591849784cb95808b818097a5809d8c88cb828a93"><span class="__cf_email__" data-cfemail="e692879487c8968388828394a6839e8f8bc8818990">[email&#160;protected]</span></a>, or by

at: <a href="https://www.exim.gov/sites/default/files/pub/pending/eib10_02.pdf">https://www.exim.gov/sites/default/files/pub/pending/eib10_02.pdf</a>.

FOR FURTHER INFORMATION CONTACT: To request additional information,

SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION: 
    Title and Form Number: EIB 10-02 Application for Short-Term Express 
Credit Insurance Policy.
    OMB Number: 3048-0031.
    Type of Review: Update & Renewal.
    Need and Use: This form is used by an exporter (or broker acting on 
its behalf) in order to obtain approval for coverage of the repayment 
risk of export sales. The information received allows EXIM staff to 
make a determination of the eligibility of the applicant and the 
creditworthiness of one of the applicant's foreign buyers for EXIM 
assistance under its programs.
    This is the application form for use by small U.S. businesses with 
limited export experience. Companies that are eligible to use the 
Express policy will need to answer approximately 20 questions and sign 
an acknowledgement of the certifications that appear on the reverse of 
the application form. This program does not provide discretionary 
credit authority to the U.S. exporter, and therefore the financial and 
credit information needs are minimized.
    Affected Public: This form affects entities involved in the export 
of U.S. goods and services.
    Annual Number of Respondents: 500.
    Estimated Time per Respondent: 0.25 hours.
    Annual Burden Hours: 125 hours.
    Frequency of Reporting of Use: Once per year.
    Government Expenses:
    Reviewing Time per Year: 1,000 hours.
    Average Wages per Hour: $42.50.
    Average Cost per Year: $42,500 (time * wages).
    Benefits and Overhead: 20%.
    Total Government Cost: $ 51,000.
