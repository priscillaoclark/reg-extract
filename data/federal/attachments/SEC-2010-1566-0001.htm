that on October 5, 2010, the EDGA Exchange, Inc. (the ``Exchange'' or 
the ``EDGA'') filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission 
(``Commission'') the proposed rule change as described in Items I and

I. Self-Regulatory Organization's Statement of the Terms of Substance 
of the Proposed Rule Change

    The Exchange proposes to amend its fees and rebates applicable to 
Members \3\ of the Exchange pursuant to EDGA Rule 15.1(a) and (c) by 
making an amendment to its fee schedule.
---------------------------------------------------------------------------

    \3\ A Member is any registered broker or dealer, or any person 
associated with a registered broker or dealer, that has been 
admitted to membership in the Exchange.
---------------------------------------------------------------------------

    All of the changes described herein are applicable to EDGA Members. 
The text of the proposed rule change is available on the Exchange's 
Internet Web site at <A HREF="http://frwebgate.access.gpo.gov/cgi-bin/leaving.cgi?from=leavingFR.html&log=linklog&to=http://www.directedge.com">http://www.directedge.com</A>.

II. Self-Regulatory Organization's Statement of the Purpose of, and 
Statutory Basis for, the Proposed Rule Change

    In its filing with the Commission, the self-regulatory organization 
included statements concerning the purpose of, and basis for, the 
proposed rule change and discussed any comments it received on the 
proposed rule change. The text of these statements may be examined at 
the places specified in Item IV below. The self-regulatory organization 
has prepared summaries, set forth in sections A, B, and C below, of the 
most significant aspects of such statements.

A. Self-Regulatory Organization's Statement of the Purpose of, and 
Statutory Basis for, the Proposed Rule Change

1. Purpose
    The Exchange proposes to change the fees and rebates for adding and 
removing liquidity. For adding liquidity, the fee is proposed to be 
increased from $0.0002 per share to $0.00025 per share. Conforming 
amendments have been made to the B, V, Y, 3, and 4 Flags (``add 
liquidity'' flags) to reflect this change. For removing liquidity, the 
rebate is proposed to be decreased from $0.0002 per share to $0.00015 
per share. Conforming amendments have been made to the N, W, and 6 flag 
(``remove liquidity'' flags) to reflect this change. In addition, Flag 
``I'' (routed to EDGX) is proposed to increased from $0.0029 per share 
to $0.0030 per share to reflect the anticipated increase on EDGX for 
October for removing liquidity (from $0.0029 per share to $0.0030 per 
share). The Exchange believes that these rate changes will enable it to 
maintain a competitive position with regards to other away market 
centers.
    The Exchange also proposes to make a technical amendment to 
footnote 2 to clarify that the rate of $0.0010 applies to when a Member 
adds greater than 1,000,000 shares hidden on a daily basis, measured 
monthly (emphasis added).
    EDGA Exchange proposes to implement these amendments to the 
Exchange fee schedule on October 5, 2010.
2. Statutory Basis
    The Exchange believes that the proposed rule change is consistent 
with the objectives of Section 6 of the Act,\4\ in general, and 
furthers the objectives of Section 6(b)(4),\5\ in particular, as it is 
designed to provide for the equitable allocation of reasonable dues, 
fees and other charges among its members and other persons using its 
facilities. The Exchange notes that it operates in a highly competitive 
market in which market participants can readily direct order flow to 
competing venues if they deem fee levels at a particular venue to be 
excessive. The proposed rule change reflects a competitive pricing 
structure designed to incent market participants to direct their order 
flow to the Exchange. Finally, the Exchange believes that the proposed 
rates are equitable in that they apply uniformly to all Members. The 
Exchange believes the fees and credits remain competitive with those 
charged by other venues and therefore continue to be reasonable and 
equitably allocated to those members that opt to direct orders to the 
Exchange rather than competing venues.

---------------------------------------------------------------------------

B. Self-Regulatory Organization's Statement on Burden on Competition

    The proposed rule change does not impose any burden on competition 
that is not necessary or appropriate in furtherance of the purposes of 
the Act.

C. Self-Regulatory Organization's Statement on Comments on the Proposed 
Rule Change Received From Members, Participants or Others

    The Exchange has not solicited, and does not intend to solicit, 
comments on this proposed rule change. The Exchange has not received 
any unsolicited written comments from members or other interested 
parties.

III. Date of Effectiveness of the Proposed Rule Change and Timing for 
Commission Action

    The foregoing rule change has become effective pursuant to Section 
19(b)(3) of the Act \6\ and Rule 19b-4(f)(2) \7\ thereunder. At any 
time within 60 days of the filing of such proposed rule change, the 
Commission summarily may temporarily suspend such rule change if it 
appears to the Commission that such action is necessary or appropriate 
in the public interest, for the protection of investors, or otherwise 
in furtherance of the purposes of the Act.
