Background

    On January 8, 2021, OFAC issued GL 1 to authorize certain 
transactions otherwise prohibited by Executive Order (E.O.) 13959 of 
November 12, 2020, ``Addressing the Threat From Securities Investments 
That Finance Communist Chinese Military Companies'' (85 FR 73185, 
November 17, 2020). Subsequently, OFAC issued two further iterations of 
GL 1, each of which authorized activities otherwise prohibited pursuant 
to E.O. 13959 as amended by E.O. 13974 of January 13, 2021, ``Amending 
Executive Order 13959--Addressing the Threat From Securities 
Investments That Finance Communist Chinese Military Companies'' (86 FR 
4875, January 19, 2021): on January 26, 2021, OFAC issued GL 1A, which 
superseded GL 1; and on May 18, 2021, OFAC issued GL 1B, which 
superseded GL 1A. Each of these GLs is now expired. On January 14, 
2021, OFAC issued GL 2 to authorize certain transactions otherwise 
prohibited by E.O. 13959, as amended. Each GL was made available on 
OFAC's website (<a href="https://ofac.treasury.gov">https://ofac.treasury.gov</a>) when it was issued. The text 
of these GLs is provided below.
