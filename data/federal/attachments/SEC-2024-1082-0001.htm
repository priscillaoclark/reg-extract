date of publication of the Notice of filing of the proposed rule

approving or disapproving the proposed rule change, however, by not 
more than 60 days if the Commission determines that a longer period is

proposed rule change was published for comment in the Federal Register 
on February 13, 2024.\11\ The 180th day after publication of the Notice 
is August 11, 2024. The Commission is extending the time period for

    The Commission finds that it is appropriate to designate a longer 
period within which to issue an order approving or disapproving the 
proposed rule change so that it has sufficient time to consider the 
proposed rule change and the issues raised therein. Accordingly, the 
Commission, pursuant to Section 19(b)(2) of the Act,\12\ designates 
October 10, 2024, as the date by which the Commission shall either 
approve or disapprove the proposed rule change (File No. SR-CboeEDGX-
2024-009).
