Source: FDIC.

    General Description of Collection: The Covered Financial Company 
(CFC) Asset Purchaser Eligibility implements the statutory requirement 
that assets held by the FDIC in the course of liquidating any covered 
financial company not be sold to persons who contributed in specified 
ways to the demise of a covered financial company. The FDIC implemented 
this requirement in its regulations at 12 CFR 380.13. Prospective 
purchasers are required to complete and submit a Purchaser Eligibility 
Certification (PEC) to the FDIC. The PEC is a self-certification by a 
prospective purchaser that it does not fall into any of the categories 
of individuals or entities that are prohibited by statute or regulation 
from purchasing assets of a CFC. The PEC will be required of any 
individual or entity that is a potential purchaser of assets from the 
FDIC, whether in its corporate capacity or as a conservator or 
receiver, for (1) a CFC; or (2) a Bridge Financial Company (BFC).
    The FDIC is increasing the total burden associated with this 
collection from 5 hours to 165 hours. The estimate for the number of 
respondents has increased from 10 to 66. The responses per respondent 
is unchanged from the 2021 submission. The estimate for hours per 
response represents a 1.5-hour increase from the 2021 submission. This 
increase is due to a change in calculation methodology.

Request for Comment

    Comments are invited on: (a) Whether the collections of information 
are necessary for the proper performance of the FDIC's functions, 
including whether the information has practical utility; (b) the 
accuracy of the estimates of the burden of the information collections, 
including the validity of the methodology and assumptions used; (c) 
ways to enhance the quality, utility, and clarity of the information to 
be collected; and (d) ways to minimize the burden of the collections of 
information on respondents, including through the use of automated 
collection techniques or other forms of information technology. All 
comments will become a matter of public record.
