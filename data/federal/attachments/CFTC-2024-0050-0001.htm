SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION: On May 10, 2024, the Commission approved 
proposed amendments to its rules concerning event contracts in certain 
excluded commodities.\1\ The proposed amendments would further specify 
types of event contracts that fall within the scope of section 
5c(c)(5)(C) of the Commodity Exchange Act (``CEA'') and are contrary to 
the public interest, such that they may not be listed for trading or 
accepted for clearing on or through a CFTC-registered entity. Among 
other things, the proposed amendments would further specify the types 
of event contracts that involve ``gaming.'' In addition, the proposed 
amendments would further align the language of the Commission's event 
contract rules with the statutory text of CEA section 5c(c)(5)(C), and 
make certain technical changes to the rules in order to enhance clarity 
and organization.
