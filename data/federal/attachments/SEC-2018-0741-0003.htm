SECURITIES AND EXCHANGE COMMISSION

[SEC File No. 270-318, OMB Control No. 3235-0361]


Proposed Collection; Comment Request; Extension: Form ADV-E

Upon Written Request, Copies Available From: Securities and Exchange 
Commission, Office of FOIA Services, 100 F Street NE, Washington, DC 
20549-2736

    Notice is hereby given that, pursuant to the Paperwork Reduction 
Act of 1995 (44 U.S.C. 3501 et seq.), the Securities and Exchange 
Commission (the ``Commission'') is soliciting comments on the 
collection of information summarized below. The Commission plans to 
submit this existing collection of information to the Office of 
Management and Budget for extension and approval.
    Form ADV-E (17 CFR 279.8) is the cover sheet for certificates of 
accounting filed pursuant to rule 206(4)-2(a)(4) under the Investment 
Advisers Act of 1940 (17 CFR 275.206(4)-(2)(a)(4)). The rule further 
requires that the public accountant file with the Commission a Form 
ADV-E and accompanying statement within four business days of the 
resignation, dismissal, removal from consideration for being 
reappointed, or other termination of its engagement.
    The Commission has estimated that compliance with the requirement 
to complete Form ADV-E imposes a total burden of approximately 0.05 
hours (3 minutes) per respondent. Based on current information from 
advisers registered with the Commission, the Commission staff estimates 
that 1,946 filings will be submitted with respect to surprise 
examinations and 52 filings will be submitted with respect to 
termination of accountants. Based on these estimates, the total 
estimated annual burden would be 99.90 hours ((1,946 filings x .05 
hours) + (52 filings x .05 hours)).
    Written comments are invited on: (a) whether the proposed 
collection of information is necessary for the proper performance of 
the functions of the Commission, including whether the information 
shall have practical utility; (b) the accuracy of the Commission's 
estimate of the burden of the collection

of information; (c) ways to enhance the quality, utility, and clarity 
of the information collected; and (d) ways to minimize the burden of 
the collection of information on respondents, including through the use 
of automated collection techniques or other forms of information 
technology. Consideration will be given to comments and suggestions 
submitted by December 6, 2024.
    An agency may not conduct or sponsor, and a person is not required 
to respond to, a collection of information under the PRA unless it 
displays a currently valid OMB control number.
    Please direct your written comments to: Austin Gerig, Director/
Chief Data Officer, Securities and Exchange Commission, c/o Oluwaseun 
Ajayi, 100 F Street NE, Washington, DC 20549 or send an email to:

Vanessa A. Countryman,
Secretary.
