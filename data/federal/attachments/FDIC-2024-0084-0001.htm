Request for Information on Deposits; Extension of Comment Period

AGENCY: Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation (FDIC).

ACTION: Request for information and comment; extension of comment 
period.

-----------------------------------------------------------------------

SUMMARY: On August 6, 2024, the FDIC published in the Federal Register 
a request for information (RFI) and comment soliciting comments on 
deposit data that is not currently reported in the Federal Financial

Condition and Income (Call Report) or other regulatory reports, 
including for uninsured deposits. The RFI provided for a 60-day comment 
period, which closes on October 7, 2024. The FDIC has determined that 
an extension of the comment period until December 6, 2024, is

SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION: On August 6, 2024, the FDIC published in the 
Federal Register an RFI and comment soliciting comments on deposit data 
that is not currently reported in the FFIEC Call Report or other 
regulatory reports, including for uninsured deposits. The FDIC issued 
the RFI to seek information on the characteristics that affect the 
stability and franchise value of different types of deposits and 
whether more detailed or more frequent reporting on these 
characteristics or types of deposits could enhance offsite risk and 
liquidity monitoring, inform analysis of the benefits and costs 
associated with additional deposit insurance coverage for certain types 
of deposits, improve risk sensitivity in deposit insurance pricing, and 
provide analysts and the general public with accurate and transparent 
data. The RFI stated that the comment period would close on October 7, 
2024. The FDIC has received requests to extend the comment period. An 
extension of the comment period will allow interested parties 
additional time to prepare information and comments. Therefore, the 
FDIC is extending the end of the comment period for the RFI from 
October 7, 2024, to December 6, 2024.
