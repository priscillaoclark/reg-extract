Self-Regulatory Organizations; NASDAQ OMX PHLX, Inc.; Notice of 
Filing and Immediate Effectiveness of Proposed Rule Change Relating to 
Rule 1015

October 7, 2010.
    Pursuant to Section 19(b)(1) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 
(``Act'') \1\ and Rule 19b-4 thereunder,\2\ notice is hereby given that 
on September 30, 2010, NASDAQ OMX PHLX, Inc. (``Phlx'' or ``Exchange'') 
filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission (``SEC'' or 
``Commission'') the proposed rule change as described in Items I, II, 
and III below, which Items have been prepared by the Exchange. The 
Commission is publishing this notice to solicit comments on the 
proposed rule change from interested persons.

I. Self-Regulatory Organization's Statement of the Terms of Substance 
of the Proposed Rule Change

    The Exchange proposes to delete Rule 1015, Execution Guarantees 
(with the exception of subparagraph (a)(vi)), which is outdated and 
should have been deleted previously. The Exchange also proposes to 
delete Options Floor Procedure Advice (``Advice'') A-11, which contains 
corresponding language. The Exchange proposes to move subparagraph 
(a)(vi) of both Rule 1015 and Advice A-11 to Rule 1063.02, which 
governs floor broker activity.
    The text of the proposed rule change is available on the Exchange's 
Web site at <A HREF="http://frwebgate.access.gpo.gov/cgi-bin/leaving.cgi?from=leavingFR.html&log=linklog&to=http://www.nasdaqtrader.com/micro.aspx?id=PHLXfilings">http://www.nasdaqtrader.com/micro.aspx?id=PHLXfilings</A>, at 
the principal office of the Exchange, at the Commission's Public 
Reference Room, and on the Commission's Web site at <A HREF="http://frwebgate.access.gpo.gov/cgi-bin/leaving.cgi?from=leavingFR.html&log=linklog&to=http://www.sec.gov">http://www.sec.gov</A>.

II. Self-Regulatory Organization's Statement of the Purpose of, and 
Statutory Basis for, the Proposed Rule Change

    In its filing with the Commission, the Exchange included statements 
concerning the purpose of, and basis for, the proposed rule change and 
discussed any comments it received on the proposed rule change. The 
text of these statements may be examined at the places specified in 
Item IV below. The Exchange has prepared summaries, set forth in 
Sections A, B, and C below, of the most significant aspects of such 
statements.

A. Self-Regulatory Organization's Statement of the Purpose of, and 
Statutory Basis for, the Proposed Rule Change

1. Purpose
    The purpose of the proposed rule change is to update and correct 
the rules by deleting two outdated rules. Generally, the execution of 
orders is now governed by Rules 1080 and 1082, among others. Rule 1015 
refers to execution guarantees, disseminated size and ``trade or fade'' 
provisions that together have become obsolete due to the combination of 
the adoption of firm quote obligations in options and increased 
automation; specifically, the disseminated size is no longer an 
artificial size that requires this rule to apportion responsibility to 
``floor traders'' to reach that minimum size. With the advent of an 
actual size in options along with automatic execution at the displayed 
size, these provisions became outdated.
    With respect to Advice A-11, it tracks the language of Rule 1015. 
Historically, Advices replicated the provisions of the Exchange's rules 
that were most pertinent for the trading floor community to keep handy, 
in lieu of the large, unwieldy rulebook; the Exchange adopted, for many 
years, both rules and advices that contained nearly identical language 
where the advice was the subject of a fine schedule under the 
Exchange's minor rule plan in order for the trading floor to have easy 
access to these provisions (which the Exchange printed and distributed) 
and in order for those persons who administered fines to have easy 
access to consult the applicable fine schedules.\3\
---------------------------------------------------------------------------

    \3\ Advices are administered as part of the Exchange's minor 
rule plan; the Exchange proposes to remove Advice A-11 from the 
minor rule plan.
---------------------------------------------------------------------------

    The Exchange proposes to move Rule 1015(a)(vi) to Rule 1063.02 
because it governs floor broker behavior and continues to be relevant.
2. Statutory Basis
    The Exchange believes that its proposal is consistent with Section 
6(b) of the Act \4\ in general, and furthers the objectives of Section 
6(b)(5) of the Act \5\ in particular, in that it is designed to promote 
just and equitable principles of trade, to remove impediments to and 
perfect the mechanism of a free and open market and a national market 
system, and, in general to protect investors and the public interest, 
by deleting obsolete provisions and generally providing clarity to the 
rules.

    \5\ 15 U.S.C. 78f(b)(5).
---------------------------------------------------------------------------

B. Self-Regulatory Organization's Statement on Burden on Competition

    The Exchange does not believe that the proposed rule change will 
impose any burden on competition not necessary or appropriate in 
furtherance of the purposes of the Act.

C. Self-Regulatory Organization's Statement on Comments on the Proposed 
Rule Change Received From Members, Participants or Others

    No written comments were either solicited or received.

III. Date of Effectiveness of the Proposed Rule Change and Timing for 
Commission Action

    Because the foregoing proposed rule change does not: (1) 
Significantly affect the protection of investors or the public 
interest; (2) impose any significant burden on competition; and (3) 
become operative for 30 days after the date of the filing, or such 
shorter time as the Commission may designate, if consistent with the 
protection of investors and the public interest, the proposed rule 
change has become effective pursuant to Section 19(b)(3)(A) of the Act 
\6\ and Rule 19b-4(f)(6) thereunder.\7\
---------------------------------------------------------------------------

    \6\ 15 U.S.C. 78s(b)(3)(A).
    \7\ 17 CFR 240.19b-4(f)(6). In addition, Rule 19b-4(f)(6)(iii) 
requires the self-regulatory organization to give the Commission 
written notice of its intent to file the proposed rule change, along 
with a brief description and text of the proposed rule change, at 
least five business days prior to the date of filing of the proposed 
rule change, or such shorter time as designated by the Commission. 
Phlx has satisfied this requirement.

---------------------------------------------------------------------------

[[Page 63232]]

    At any time within 60 days of the filing of the proposed rule 
change, the Commission summarily may temporarily suspend such rule 
change if it appears to the Commission that such action is necessary or 
appropriate in the public interest, for the protection of investors, or 
otherwise in furtherance of the purposes of the Act. If the Commission 
takes such action, the Commission shall institute proceedings to 
determine whether the proposed rule should be approved or disapproved.
