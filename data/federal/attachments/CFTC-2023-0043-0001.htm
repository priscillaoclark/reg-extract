SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION: On April 14, 2023, the Commission published 
in the Federal Register an NPRM proposing to amend the CFTC's 
derivatives clearing organization (DCO) risk management regulations 
adopted under section 5b of the Commodity Exchange Act to permit 
futures commission merchants that are clearing members to treat the 
separate accounts of a single customer as accounts of separate entities 
for purposes of Commission regulation Sec.  39.13(g)(8)(iii).\2\ The 
proposed amendments would add a new paragraph (j) to regulation Sec.  
39.13 establishing the conditions under which a DCO may permit such 
separate account treatment. The comment period for the NPRM closes on 
June 13, 2023. As requested by a commenter, the Commission is extending 
the comment period for this NPRM by an additional 17 days.\3\ This 
extension of the comment period will allow interested persons 
additional time to analyze the proposal and prepare their comments.
