Background

    On July 22, 2004, President Bush issued Executive Order 13348 
(``the order'' or ``EO 13348''), finding that the actions and policies 
of former Liberian President Charles Taylor and other persons, in 
particular their unlawful depletion of Liberian resources and their 
removal from Liberia, and secreting of Liberian funds and property, 
undermined Liberia's transition to democracy, the orderly development 
of Liberia's political, administrative, and economic institutions and 
resources, and fueled and exacerbated other conflicts throughout West 
Africa. The President found that the actions, policies, and 
circumstances described above constituted an unusual and extraordinary 
threat to the foreign policy of the United States and declared a 
national emergency to deal with that threat.
    The order included 28 persons in the Annex, which resulted in the 
blocking of all property or interests in property of these persons that 
was or thereafter came within the United States or the possession or 
control of U.S. persons. The order authorizes the Secretary of the 
Treasury, in consultation with the Secretary of State, to designate 
additional persons or entities determined to meet certain criteria set 
forth in EO 13348.
    The order also authorizes the Secretary of the Treasury, in 
consultation with the Secretary of State, to determine that 
circumstances no longer warrant the inclusion of a person in the Annex 
to EO 13348 and to unblock any property or interests in property that 
had been blocked as a result of the person's inclusion in the Annex.
    On December 14, 2010, the Director of OFAC, in consultation with 
the State Department, determined that circumstances no longer warrant 
the inclusion of the individual listed below in the Annex to EO 13448 
and that the property and interests in property of the individual 
listed below are therefore no longer blocked pursuant to section 1(a) 
of EO 13448, and accordingly removed him from the list of Specially 
Designated Nationals and Blocked Persons.
