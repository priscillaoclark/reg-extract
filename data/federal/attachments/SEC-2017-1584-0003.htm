SECURITIES AND EXCHANGE COMMISSION

[SEC File No. 270-457, OMB Control No. 3235-0518]


Submission for OMB Review; Comment Request; Extension: Form CB, 
Tender Offer/Rights Offering Notification Form

Upon Written Request Copies Available From: Securities and Exchange 
Commission, Office of FOIA Services, 100 F Street NE, Washington, DC 
20549-2736

    Notice is hereby given that, pursuant to the Paperwork Reduction 
Act of 1995 (44 U.S.C. 3501 et seq.), the Securities and Exchange 
Commission (``Commission'') has submitted to the Office of Management 
and Budget this request for extension of the previously approved 
collection of information discussed below.
    Form CB (17 CFR 239.800) is a document filed in connection with a 
tender offer for a foreign private issuer. This form is used to report 
an issuer tender offer conducted in compliance with Exchange Act Rule 
13e-4(h)(8) (17 CFR 240.13e-4(h)(8)), a third-party tender offer 
conducted in compliance with Exchange Act Rule 14d-1(c) (17 CFR 
240.14d-1(c)) and a going private transaction conducted in accordance 
with Rule 13e-3(g)(6) (17 CFR 240.13e-3(g)(6)). Form CB is also used by 
a subject company pursuant to Exchange Act Rule 14e-2(d) (17 CFR 
240.14e-2(d)). This information is made available to the public. 
Information provided on Form CB is mandatory. Form CB takes 
approximately 0.5 hours per response to prepare and is filed by 
approximately 58 respondents annually. We estimate that 25% of the 0.5 
hours per response (0.125 hours) is prepared by the respondent for an 
annual reporting burden of 7 hours (0.125 hours per response x 58 
responses).
    An agency may not conduct or sponsor, and a person is not required 
to respond to, a collection of information unless it displays a 
currently valid control number.
    The public may view background documentation for this information 
collection at the following website: <a href="http://www.reginfo.gov">www.reginfo.gov</a>. Find this 
particular information collection by selecting ``Currently under 30-day 
Review--Open for Public Comments'' or by using the search function. 
Written comments and recommendations for the proposed information 
collection should be sent within 30 days of publication of this notice 
by January 10, 2024 to (i) <a href="http://www.reginfo.gov/public/do/PRAMain">www.reginfo.gov/public/do/PRAMain</a> and (ii) 
David Bottom, Director/Chief Information Officer, Securities and 
Exchange Commission, c/o John Pezzullo, 100 F Street NE, Washington, DC 
20549, or by sending an email to: <a href="/cdn-cgi/l/email-protection#fbaba9baa4b69a9297999483bb889e98d59c948d"><span class="__cf_email__" data-cfemail="66363427392b070f0a04091e2615030548010910">[email&#160;protected]</span></a>.

    Dated: December 6, 2023.
Sherry R. Haywood,
Assistant Secretary.
