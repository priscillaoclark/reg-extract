Initial Statement of Beneficial Ownership of Securities

Upon Written Request Copies Available From: Securities and Exchange 
Commission, Office of FOIA Services, 100 F Street NE, Washington, DC 
20549-2736

    Notice is hereby given that, pursuant to the Paperwork Reduction 
Act of 1995 (44 U.S.C. 3501 et seq.), the Securities and Exchange 
Commission (``Commission'') has submitted to the Office of Management 
and Budget this request for extension of the previously approved 
collection of information discussed below.
    Under Section 16(a) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 
(``Exchange Act'') (15 U.S.C. 78a et seq.), every person who owns more 
than ten percent of any class of equity security (other than an 
exempted security) which is requested under Section 12 of the Exchange 
Act, or who is a director or an officer of the issuer of such security 
(collectively ``reporting persons'') are required to file statements 
disclosing their ownership of the issuer's equity securities. Form 3 
must be filed within ten days after the event by which the person 
becomes a reporting person. Approximately 16,520 insiders file Form 3 
annually and it takes approximately 0.50 hours to prepare for a total 
of 8,260 annual burden hours (0.50 hours per response x 16,520 
responses).
    An agency may not conduct or sponsor, and a person is not required 
to respond to, a collection of information unless it displays a 
currently valid control number.
    The public may view background documentation for this information 
collection at the following website: <a href="http://www.reginfo.gov">www.reginfo.gov</a>. Find this 
particular information collection by selecting ``Currently under 30-day
