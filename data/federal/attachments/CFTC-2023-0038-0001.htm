SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION: 
    Title: Qualification Information for Candidates to Advisory 
Committees and Subcommittees. This is a request for a new information 
collection.
    Abstract: The CFTC's advisory committees were created to provide 
input and make recommendations to the Commission on a variety of 
regulatory and market issues that affect the integrity and 
competitiveness of U.S. derivatives markets. The committees facilitate 
communication between the Commission and U.S. derivatives markets, 
trading firms, market participants, and end users. The CFTC currently 
has five advisory committees. The Energy and Environmental Markets

[[Page 29101]]

Advisory Committee was established by the Dodd-Frank Wall Street Reform 
and Consumer Protection Act, Public Law 111-203, and subsequently 
codified in the Commodity Exchange Act, 7 U.S.C. 1 et seq., at 7 U.S.C. 
2(a)(15), and is not subject to the Federal Advisory Committee Act 
(FACA), 5 U.S.C. 1001 et seq. The Agricultural Advisory Committee, 
Global Markets Advisory Committee, Market Risk Advisory Committee, and 
the Technology Advisory Committee are discretionary committees under 
the FACA. The Commission also establishes subcommittees that report to 
advisory committees as needed. Advisory committee and subcommittee 
members are generally representatives, but depending on the issues to 
be addressed, the Commission will appoint special government employees 
and officials from other federal agencies from time to time. 
Representatives provide the viewpoints of entities or recognizable 
groups, and they are expected to represent a particular and known bias. 
On the other hand, special government employees are expected to provide 
their own independent judgment in committee deliberations and are 
expected to discuss and deliberate in a manner that is free from 
conflicts of interest.\2\ Advisory committee and subcommittee members 
generally serve 2, 3 or 4-year terms, and appointments are made 
following the establishment of a new subcommittee or as committee or 
subcommittee vacancies arise.
---------------------------------------------------------------------------

    \2\ 18 U.S.C. 202(a).
---------------------------------------------------------------------------

    The CFTC identifies candidates for advisory committee and 
subcommittee membership through a variety of methods, including public 
requests for nominations; recommendations from existing advisory 
committee members; consultations with knowledgeable persons outside the 
CFTC (industry, consumer groups, other state or federal government 
agencies, academia, etc.); requests to be represented received from 
individuals and organizations; and Commissioners' and CFTC staff's 
professional knowledge of those experienced in the derivatives and 
underlying commodities markets. Following the identification process, 
the CFTC develops a list of proposed members with the relevant points 
of view needed to ensure membership balance. The Commission then votes 
to appoint individuals, or specified organizations, to serve.\3\
---------------------------------------------------------------------------

    \3\ Appendix A to subpart C of 41 CFR 102-3, the Federal 
Advisory Committee Management Final Rule notes that the FACA does 
not specify the manner in which advisory committee members must be 
appointed.
---------------------------------------------------------------------------

    The collection of information is necessary to support the CFTC 
Advisory Committee Program which includes committees, most of which are 
governed by the FACA, and subcommittees that report directly to the 
CFTC FACA committees, as noted above. Pursuant to the FACA, an agency 
must ensure that a committee is balanced with respect to the viewpoints 
represented and the functions to be performed by that committee. 
Consistent with this, in order to select individuals for potential 
membership on an advisory committee, the CFTC must determine that 
potential members are qualified to serve on an advisory committee and 
that the viewpoints are properly balanced on the committee. The CFTC is 
also required to ensure that committee members are properly designated 
as special government employees or representatives.\4\ While CFTC 
subcommittees are not subject to the FACA, the selection process for 
subcommittee members who are not already serving on the parent 
committee is similar to that of new committee members. Additionally, 
the agency follows similar member selection procedures for the agency's 
non-FACA committee.
---------------------------------------------------------------------------

    \4\ See, OGE DO-04X9, DO-04-022, and DO-05-012.
---------------------------------------------------------------------------

    CFTC staff would use the information collected to determine the 
experience and expertise of potential advisory committee and 
subcommittee members, ensure that the membership on a committee or 
subcommittee is balanced, and ensure that committee and subcommittee 
members are properly designated as representatives or special 
government employees.
    The CFTC seeks to collect the following information: Information 
that supports an individual's experience and expertise to serve on an 
advisory committee or subcommittee, including letters of interest, 
recommendation letters, nomination letters (including self-
nominations), resumes, curriculum vitae or other similar biographical 
information document. Additionally, information that ensures membership 
balance (e.g., represented viewpoint category) and appropriate 
designation of an individual as either a representative or special 
government employee.
    An agency may not conduct or sponsor, and a person is not required 
to respond to, a collection of information unless it displays a 
currently valid OMB control number.\5\ On May 17, 2022, the Commission 
published in the Federal Register a notice of a proposed information 
collection and provided 60 days for public comment on the proposed 
extension, 87 FR 29855 (``60-Day Notice''). The Commission did not 
receive any relevant comments on the 60-Day Notice.
---------------------------------------------------------------------------

    \5\ 44 U.S.C. 3512, 5 CFR 1320.5(b)(2)(i) and 1320.8 (b)(3)(vi).
---------------------------------------------------------------------------

    Burden Statement: The respondent burden for this collection is 
estimated to be as follows:
    Estimated Number of Respondents: 91.
    Estimated Average Burden Hours per Respondent: 1.
    Estimated Total Annual Burden Hours: 91.
    Frequency of Collection: As needed.
    There are no capital costs or operating and maintenance costs 
associated with this collection.

(Authority: 44 U.S.C. 3501 et seq.)

    Dated: May 2, 2023.
Robert Sidman,
Deputy Secretary of the Commission.
