    General Description of Collection: The collection of information 
requirements is contained in 12 CFR part 344. The purpose of the 
regulation is to ensure that purchasers of securities in transactions 
affected by insured State nonmember banks are provided with adequate 
records concerning the transactions. The regulation is also designed to 
ensure that insured State nonmember banks maintain adequate records and 
controls with respect to the securities transactions they effect. 
Finally, this regulation requires officers and employees of FDIC-
supervised institutions to report to the FDIC-supervised institution 
certain personal securities trading activity. There is no change in the 
methodology or substance of this information collection. The decrease 
in total estimated annual burden from 8,583 hours in 2021 to 8,216 
hours currently is due to a

Source: FDIC.

    General Description of Collection: Section 42 of the Federal 
Deposit Insurance Act mandates that an insured depository institution 
closing a branch notify its primary Federal regulator not later than 90 
days prior to the closing. The statute also provides that a notice be 
posted on the premises of the branch for the 30-day period immediately 
prior to the closing and that the customers be notified in a mailing at 
least 90 days prior to the closing. Each insured depository institution 
that has one or more branches is required to adopt a written policy for 
branch closings. There is no change in the methodology or substance of 
this information collection. The increase in total estimated annual 
burden from 1,738 hours in 2021 to 1,795 hours currently is due to an 
increase in estimated number or respondents.

    General Description of Collection: This information collection 
consists of two parts: (1) a certification that insured depository 
institutions provide the FDIC when all deposit liabilities from one 
insured depository institution are assumed from another insured 
depository institution, with the latter institution responsible for 
providing the certification; and (2) a notification that an insured 
depository institution provides to its depositors when it seeks to 
voluntarily terminate its insured status. The certification is 
necessary to implement the provisions of section 8(q) of the Federal 
Deposit Insurance Act, 12 U.S.C. 1818(q), regarding termination of the 
insured status of the transferring institution and termination of the 
separate deposit insurance coverage provided on deposit accounts 
assumed by the assuming institution. The depositor notification is 
required by section 8(a)(6) of the Federal Deposit Insurance Act, 12 
U.S.C. 1818(a)(6). This provision ensures that the institution's 
depositors receive appropriate information regarding the institution's 
intent to terminate its insured status and that, prior to the 
termination of the institution's insured status, depositors receive 
appropriate information concerning Federal deposit insurance coverage 
of their accounts once the institution's insured status is terminated. 
There is no change in the methodology or substance of this information 
collection. The decrease in total estimated annual burden from 256 in 
2021 to 186 currently is due to a change in the estimated number or 
respondents.
    4. Title: Extension without change of a currently approved 
collection.
    OMB Number: 3064-0134.

    General Description of Collection: This collection facilitates the 
collection of information from customers of financial institutions that 
have inquiries or complaints about service. Customers or businesses may 
document their complaints or inquiries to the FDIC using a letter or 
optional forms (Form 6422/04, Form 6422/11, Form 6422/15). The forms 
are used to facilitate online completion and submission of the 
complaints or inquiries and to shorten FDIC response times by making it 
easier to identify the nature of the complaint and to route the 
customer or business inquiry to the appropriate FDIC contact. There is 
no change in the methodology or substance of this information 
collection. The increase in total estimated annual burden from 1,468 in 
2021 to 2,806 currently is due to an increase in the estimated number 
or respondents.
    5. Title: Large-Bank Deposit Insurance Programs.
    OMB Number: 3064-0162.
    Form Number: None.
    Affected Public: Insured depository institutions having at least $2

    General Description of Collection: Upon the failure of an FDIC-
insured depository institution, the FDIC is required to pay insured 
deposits as soon as possible. To do so, the FDIC must be able to 
quickly determine the total insured amount for each depositor. To make 
this determination, the FDIC must ascertain the balances of all deposit 
accounts owned by the same depositor in the same ownership capacity at 
a failed institution as of the day of failure. The FDIC issued a 
regulation (12 CFR 360.9) to modernize the process of determining the 
insurance status of each depositor in the event of failure of a covered 
institution. The regulations enable operations of a large insured 
depository institution to continue functioning on the day following 
failure, support the FDIC's efforts to fulfill its legal mandates 
regarding the resolution of failed insured deposit institutions, and 
apply to the largest institutions only ($2 billion in domestic deposits 
or more). More specifically, the regulations require the largest 
insured depository institutions to adopt mechanisms that would, in the 
event of the institution's failure (1) provide the FDIC with standard 
deposit account and customer information, and (2) allow the FDIC to 
place and release holds on liability accounts, including deposits. 
There is no change in the methodology or substance of this information 
collection. The decrease in total estimated annual burden from 6,464 
hours in 2021 to 5,948 hours currently is due to a decrease in 
estimated number of respondents.

    General Description of Collection: The FDIC's deposit insurance 
assessment authority is set forth in section 7 of the Federal Deposit 
Insurance Act, 12 U.S.C. 1817(b) and (c), and promulgated in 
regulations under 12 CFR part 327. These regulations also set out the 
process for making adjustments to the total score of these institutions 
used by the FDIC in making deposit insurance assessments. Depository 
institutions are permitted to make a written request to the FDIC for an 
assessment adjustment. An institution is able to request review of, or 
appeal, an upward adjustment, the magnitude of an upward adjustment, 
removal of a previously implemented downward adjustment, or an increase 
in a previously implemented upward adjustment through the FDIC's 
internal review process set forth at 12 CFR 327.4(c). An institution 
can similarly request review of, or appeal, a decision not to apply an 
adjustment following a request by the institution for an adjustment. An 
institution can submit its written request for an adjustment to the 
FDIC's Director of the Division of Insurance and Research in 
Washington, DC. In making such a request, the institution will provide 
support by including evidence of a material risk or risk mitigating 
factor that it believes was not adequately considered. There is no 
change in the methodology or substance of this information collection. 
The decrease in total estimated annual burden from 160 hours in 2021 to 
80 hours currently is due to a decrease in estimated number or 
respondents.

    General Description of Collection: This information collection 
comprises recordkeeping and disclosure requirements under regulations 
issued by the (FDIC, jointly with the Office of the Comptroller of the 
Currency, the Board of Governors of the Federal Reserve System, the 
National Credit Union Administration, the Bureau of Consumer Financial 
Protection, and the Federal Home Finance Agency that implement the 
minimum requirements in section 1473 of the Dodd-Frank Wall Street 
Reform and Consumer Protection Act (Dodd-Frank Act) to be applied by 
States in the registration and supervision of appraisal management 
companies (AMCs). The regulations also implement the requirement in 
section 1473 of the Dodd-Frank Act for States to report to the 
Appraisal Subcommittee of the Federal Financial Institutions 
Examination Council the information required by the ASC to administer 
the new national registry of AMCs. The information collection 
requirements are established in 12 CFR part 323 of the FDIC's codified 
regulations. There is no change in the methodology or substance of this 
information collection. The decrease in total estimated annual burden 
from 2,457 in 2021 to 1,991 currently is due to a change in the 
estimated number or respondents.

Request for Comment

    Comments are invited on (a) whether the collection of information 
is necessary for the proper performance of the FDIC's functions, 
including whether the information has practical utility; (b) the

including the validity of the methodology and assumptions used; (c) 
ways to enhance the quality, utility, and clarity of the information to 
be collected; and (d) ways to minimize the burden of the collection of 
information on respondents, including through the use of automated 
collection techniques or other forms of information technology. All 
comments will become a matter of public record.
