SECURITIES AND EXCHANGE COMMISSION

[Release No. 34-100623; File No. 4-678]


Program for Allocation of Regulatory Responsibilities Pursuant to 
Rule 17d-2; Notice of Filing and Order Approving and Declaring 
Effective an Amended Proposed Plan for the Allocation of Regulatory 
Responsibilities Among the Financial Industry Regulatory Authority, 
Inc., Miami International Securities Exchange, LLC, MIAX Pearl, LLC, 
MIAX Emerald, LLC, and MIAX Sapphire, LLC

July 31, 2024.
    Notice is hereby given that the Securities and Exchange Commission 
(``Commission'') has issued an Order, pursuant to Section 17(d) of the 
Securities Exchange Act of 1934 (``Act''),\1\ approving and declaring 
effective an amendment to the plan for allocating regulatory 
responsibility (``Plan'') filed on July 22, 2024, pursuant to Rule 17d-
2 of the Act,\2\ by the Miami International Securities Exchange, LLC 
(``MIAX''), MIAX Pearl, LLC (``MIAX Pearl''), MIAX Emerald, LLC (``MIAX 
Emerald''), MIAX Sapphire, LLC (``MIAX Sapphire'') and the Financial 
Industry Regulatory Authority, Inc. (``FINRA'') (together, the 
``Parties''). The Plan replaces and supersedes the agreement entered 
into between FINRA, MIAX, MIAX Pearl, and MIAX Emerald on September 2, 
2020, entitled ``Agreement among Financial Industry Regulatory 
Authority, Inc., Miami International Securities Exchange, LLC, MIAX 
PEARL, LLC, and MIAX Emerald, LLC Pursuant to Rule 17d-2 under the 
Securities Exchange Act of 1934.'' \3\

---------------------------------------------------------------------------

I. Introduction

    Section 19(g)(1) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 
(``Act''),\4\ among other things, requires every self-regulatory 
organization (``SRO'') registered as either a national securities 
exchange or national securities association to examine for, and enforce 
compliance by, its members and persons associated with its members with 
the Act, the rules and regulations thereunder, and the SRO's own rules, 
unless the SRO is relieved of this responsibility pursuant to Section 
17(d) or Section 19(g)(2) of the Act.\5\ Without this relief, the 
statutory obligation of each individual SRO could result in a pattern 
of multiple examinations of broker-dealers that maintain memberships in 
more than one SRO (``common members''). Such regulatory duplication 
would add unnecessary expenses for common members and their SROs.

    \5\ 15 U.S.C. 78q(d) and 15 U.S.C. 78s(g)(2), respectively.
---------------------------------------------------------------------------

    Section 17(d)(1) of the Act \6\ was intended, in part, to eliminate 
unnecessary multiple examinations and regulatory duplication.\7\ With 
respect to a common member, Section 17(d)(1) authorizes the Commission, 
by rule or order, to relieve an SRO of the responsibility to receive 
regulatory reports, to examine for and enforce compliance with 
applicable statutes, rules, and regulations, or to perform other 
specified regulatory functions.
---------------------------------------------------------------------------

    \6\ 15 U.S.C. 78q(d)(1).
    \7\ See Securities Act Amendments of 1975, Report of the Senate 
Committee on Banking, Housing, and Urban Affairs to Accompany S. 
249, S. Rep. No. 94-75, 94th Cong., 1st Session 32 (1975).
---------------------------------------------------------------------------

    To implement Section 17(d)(1), the Commission adopted two rules: 
Rule 17d-1 and Rule 17d-2 under the Act.\8\ Rule 17d-1 authorizes the 
Commission to name a single SRO as the designated examining authority 
(``DEA'') to examine common members for compliance with the financial 
responsibility requirements imposed by the Act, or by Commission or SRO 
rules.\9\ When an SRO has been named as a common member's DEA, all 
other SROs to which the common member belongs are relieved of the 
responsibility to examine the firm for compliance with the applicable 
financial responsibility rules. On its face, Rule 17d-1 deals only with 
an SRO's obligations to enforce member compliance with financial 
responsibility requirements. Rule 17d-1 does not relieve an SRO from 
its obligation to examine a common member for compliance with its own 
rules and provisions of the federal securities laws governing matters 
other than financial responsibility, including sales practices and 
trading activities and practices.

    \9\ See Securities Exchange Act Release No. 12352 (April 20, 
1976), 41 FR 18808 (May 7, 1976).
---------------------------------------------------------------------------

    To address regulatory duplication in these and other areas, the 
Commission adopted Rule 17d-2 under the Act.\10\ Rule 17d-2 permits 
SROs to propose joint plans for the allocation of regulatory 
responsibilities with respect to their common members. Under paragraph 
(c) of Rule 17d-2, the Commission may declare such a plan effective if, 
after providing for appropriate notice and comment, it determines that 
the plan is necessary or appropriate in the public interest and for the 
protection of investors; to foster cooperation and coordination among 
the SROs; to remove impediments to, and foster the development of, a 
national market system and a national clearance and settlement system; 
and is in conformity with the factors set forth in Section 17(d) of the 
Act. Commission approval of a plan filed pursuant to Rule 17d-2 
relieves an SRO of those regulatory responsibilities allocated by the 
plan to another SRO.

1976), 41 FR 49091 (November 8, 1976).
---------------------------------------------------------------------------

II. The Plan

    On November 19, 2014, the Commission declared effective the Plan 
entered into between FINRA and MIAX for allocating regulatory 
responsibility pursuant to Rule 17d-2.\11\ The Plan is intended to 
reduce regulatory duplication for firms that are common members of both 
MIAX and FINRA. The plan reduces regulatory duplication for firms that 
are members of MIAX and FINRA by allocating regulatory responsibility 
with respect to certain applicable laws, rules, and regulations. 
Included in the Plan is an exhibit that lists every MIAX rule for which 
FINRA bears responsibility under the Plan for overseeing and enforcing 
with respect to MIAX members that are also members of FINRA and the 
associated persons therewith. On January 12, 2017, the parties 
submitted a proposed amendment to the Plan to add MIAX

[[Page 64026]]

Pearl as a Participant to the Plan.\12\ On June 28, 2018, the parties 
submitted a proposed amendment to the Plan to allocate surveillance, 
investigation, and enforcement responsibilities for Rule 14e-4 under 
the Act, as well as certain provisions of Regulation SHO.\13\ On 
December 20, 2018, the parties submitted a proposed amendment to the 
Plan to add MIAX Emerald as a Participant to the Plan.\14\ On September 
2, 2020, the parties submitted a proposed amendment to the Plan to add 
MIAX Pearl equities rules and certain federal securities laws.\15\

III. Proposed Amendment to the Plan

    On July 22, 2024, the parties submitted a proposed amendment to the

deletions are [bracketed]):

(the ``Agreement''), pursuant to Section 17(d) of the Securities 
Exchange Act of 1934 (the ``Exchange Act'') and Rule 17d-2 thereunder, 
which permits agreements between self-regulatory organizations to 
allocate regulatory responsibility to eliminate regulatory duplication. 
FINRA, MIAX, MIAX Pearl[EARL], MIAX Emerald and MIAX [Emerald] Sapphire 
may be referred to individually as a ``party'' and together as the

    This Agreement amends and restates the agreement entered into

19, 2018] September 2, 2020, entitled ``Agreement [between] among 
Financial Industry Regulatory Authority, Inc., Miami International 
Securities Exchange, LLC, MIAX PEARL, LLC and MIAX [PEARL] Emerald, LLC 
Pursuant to Rule 17d-2 under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934,'' and

examination and surveillance of their Common Members (as defined 
herein) and in the filing and processing of certain registration and 
membership records; and
    WHEREAS, the parties desire to execute an agreement covering such 
subjects pursuant to the provisions of Rule 17d-2 under the Exchange 
Act and to file such agreement with the Securities and Exchange

Sapphire shall retain full responsibility for (unless otherwise

(90) days advance written notice in the event FINRA decides to impose

Sapphire for performing the Regulatory Responsibilities under this 
Agreement. If FINRA determines to impose a charge, MIAX, MIAX 
Pearl[EARL], MIAX Emerald and MIAX [Emerald] Sapphire shall have the 
right at the time of the imposition of such charge to terminate this 
Agreement; provided, however, that FINRA's Regulatory Responsibilities 
under this Agreement shall continue until the Commission approves the 
termination of this Agreement.
    5. Applicability of Certain Laws, Rules, Regulations or Orders. 
Notwithstanding any provision hereof, this Agreement shall be subject 
to any statute, or any rule or order of the SEC. To the extent such 
statute, rule or order is inconsistent with one or more provisions of 
this Agreement, the statute, rule or order shall supersede the 
provision(s) hereof to the extent necessary to be properly effectuated 
and the provision(s) hereof in that respect shall be null and void.
    6. Notification of Violations. In the event that FINRA becomes 
aware of apparent violations of any MIAX Rules, MIAX Pearl[EARL] Rules 
[or], MIAX Emerald Rules[,] or MIAX Sapphire Rules which are not listed 
as Common Rules, discovered pursuant to the performance of the 
Regulatory Responsibilities assumed hereunder, FINRA shall notify MIAX, 
MIAX Pearl[EARL], MIAX Emerald and MIAX [Emerald] Sapphire of those

aware of apparent violations of any Common Rules, discovered pursuant

thereto shall be conducted by FINRA as provided hereinbefore; provided, 
however, that in the event a Common Member is the subject of an 
investigation relating to a transaction on MIAX, MIAX Pearl[EARL], MIAX 
Emerald or MIAX [Emerald] Sapphire, MIAX, MIAX Pearl[EARL], MIAX 
Emerald and MIAX [Emerald] Sapphire may in their discretion assume 
concurrent jurisdiction and responsibility. Each party agrees to make 
available promptly all files, records and witnesses necessary to assist 
the other in its investigation or proceedings.
    7. Continued Assistance.

Emerald and MIAX [Emerald] Sapphire all information obtained by FINRA 
in the performance by it of the Regulatory Responsibilities hereunder 
with respect to the Common Members subject to this Agreement. In 
particular, and not in limitation of the foregoing, FINRA shall furnish 
MIAX, MIAX Pearl[EARL], MIAX Emerald and MIAX [Emerald] Sapphire any 
information it obtains about Common Members which reflects adversely on 
their financial condition. MIAX, MIAX Pearl[EARL], MIAX Emerald and 
MIAX [Emerald] Sapphire shall make available to FINRA any information 
coming to its attention that reflects adversely on the financial 
condition of Common Members or indicates possible violations of 
applicable laws, rules or regulations by such firms.
    (b) The parties agree that documents or information shared shall be 
held in confidence [,] and used only for the purposes of carrying out 
their respective regulatory obligations. No party shall assert 
regulatory or other privileges as against any other with respect to 
documents or information that is required to be shared pursuant to this 
Agreement.

[[Page 64028]]

    (c) The sharing of documents or information among the parties 
pursuant to this Agreement shall not be deemed a waiver as against 
third parties of regulatory or other privileges relating to the 
discovery of documents or information.
    8. Statutory Disqualifications. When FINRA becomes aware of a 
statutory disqualification as defined in the Exchange Act with respect 
to a Common Member, FINRA shall determine pursuant to Sections 15A(g) 
and/or Section 6(c) of the Exchange Act the acceptability or continued 
applicability of the person to whom such disqualification applies and 
keep MIAX, MIAX Pearl[EARL], MIAX Emerald and MIAX [Emerald] Sapphire 
advised of its actions in this regard for such subsequent proceedings 
as MIAX, MIAX Pearl[EARL], MIAX Emerald and MIAX [Emerald] Sapphire may 
initiate.
    9. Customer Complaints. MIAX, MIAX Pearl[EARL], MIAX Emerald and 
MIAX [Emerald] Sapphire shall forward to FINRA copies of all customer 
complaints involving Common Members received by MIAX, MIAX Pearl[EARL], 
MIAX Emerald and MIAX [Emerald] Sapphire relating to FINRA's Regulatory 
Responsibilities under this Agreement. It shall be FINRA's 
responsibility to review and take appropriate action in respect to such 
complaints.
    10. Advertising. FINRA shall assume responsibility to review the 
advertising of Common Members subject to the Agreement, provided that 
such material is filed with FINRA in accordance with FINRA's filing 
procedures and is accompanied with any applicable filing fees set forth 
in FINRA Rules.
    11. No Restrictions on Regulatory Action. Nothing contained in this 
Agreement shall restrict or in any way encumber the right of any party 
to conduct its own independent or concurrent investigation, examination 
or enforcement proceeding of or against Common Members, as any party, 
in its sole discretion, shall deem appropriate or necessary.
    12. Termination. This Agreement may be terminated by any party at 
any time upon the approval of the Commission after one (1) year's 
written notice to the other parties (or such shorter time as agreed by 
the parties), except as provided in paragraph 4.
    13. Arbitration. In the event of a dispute among the parties as to 
the operation of this Agreement, the parties hereby agree that any such 
dispute shall be settled by arbitration in Washington, DC in accordance 
with the rules of the American Arbitration Association then in effect, 
or such other procedures as the parties may mutually agree upon. 
Judgment on the award rendered by the arbitrator(s) may be entered in 
any court having jurisdiction. Each party acknowledges that the timely 
and complete performance of its obligations pursuant to this Agreement 
is critical to the business and operations of the other parties. In the 
event of a dispute among the parties, the parties shall continue to 
perform their respective obligations under this Agreement in good faith 
during the resolution of such dispute unless and until this Agreement 
is terminated in accordance with its provisions. Nothing in this

  the continuing education programs under MIAX and MIAX Emerald Rules 1903(c), or MIAX Pearl Rule 3103(c),
  between September 18, 2023, and December 31, 2023, to complete any prescribed 2022 and 2023 continuing
  education content by March 31, 2024. In contrast, FINRA Rule 1240.01 requires individuals enrolled in the
  continuing education program under FINRA Rule 1240(c) in both 2022 and 2023 to complete their prescribed 2022
  and 2023 continuing education content by: (1) March 31, 2024; or (2) between May 22, 2024, and July 1, 2024
  (where such individuals did not complete their prescribed 2022 and 2023 continuing education content as of
  March 31, 2024). In addition, FINRA Rule 1240.01 provides that individuals enrolled in the continuing
  education program under FINRA Rule 1240(c) who will have completed their prescribed 2022 and 2023 continuing
  education content between March 31, 2024 and May 22, 2024 will be deemed to have completed such content by
  July 1, 2024. As a result, FINRA shall not have Regulatory Responsibilities for Interpretations and Policies

V. Discussion

    The Commission finds that the proposed Amended Plan is consistent 
with the factors set forth in Section 17(d) of the Act \16\ and Rule 
17d-2(c) thereunder \17\ in that the proposed Amended Plan is necessary 
or appropriate in the public interest and for the protection of 
investors, fosters cooperation and coordination among SROs, and removes 
impediments to and fosters the development of the national market 
system. In particular, the Commission believes that the proposed 
Amended Plan should reduce unnecessary regulatory duplication by 
allocating to FINRA certain examination and enforcement 
responsibilities for Common Members that would otherwise be performed 
by FINRA and at least one of MIAX, MIAX Pearl, MIAX Emerald, or MIAX 
Sapphire. Accordingly, the proposed Amended Plan promotes efficiency by 
reducing costs to common members. Furthermore, because MIAX, MIAX 
Pearl, MIAX Emerald, MIAX Sapphire and FINRA will coordinate their 
regulatory functions in accordance with the Amended Plan, the Amended 
Plan should promote investor protection.

    \16\ 15 U.S.C. 78q(d).
    \17\ 17 CFR 240.17d-2(c).
---------------------------------------------------------------------------

    The Commission notes that, under the Amended Plan, MIAX, MIAX 
Pearl, MIAX Emerald, MIAX Sapphire and FINRA have allocated regulatory 
responsibility for those MIAX, MIAX Pearl, MIAX Emerald, and MIAX 
Sapphire rules, set forth in the Certification, that are substantially 
similar to the applicable FINRA rules in that examination for 
compliance with such provisions and rules would not require FINRA to 
develop one or more new examination standards, modules, procedures, or 
criteria in order to analyze the application of the rule, or a common 
member's activity, conduct, or output in relation to such rule. In 
addition, under the Amended Plan, FINRA would assume regulatory 
responsibility for certain provisions of the federal securities laws 
and the rules and regulations thereunder that are set forth in the 
Certification. The common rules covered by the Amended Plan are 
specifically listed in the Certification, as may be amended by the 
parties from time to time.
    According to the Amended Plan, MIAX, MIAX Pearl, MIAX Emerald, and 
MIAX Sapphire will review the Certification at least annually, or more 
frequently if required by changes in either the rules of MIAX, MIAX 
Pearl, MIAX Emerald, MIAX Sapphire, or FINRA, and, if necessary, submit 
to FINRA an updated list of common rules to add MIAX, MIAX Pearl, MIAX 
Emerald, or MIAX Sapphire rules not included on the then-current list 
of common rules that are substantially similar to FINRA rules; delete 
MIAX, MIAX Pearl, MIAX Emerald, or MIAX Sapphire rules included in the 
then-current list of common rules that no longer qualify as common 
rules; and confirm that the remaining rules on the list of common rules 
continue to be MIAX, MIAX Pearl, MIAX Emerald, or MIAX Sapphire rules 
that qualify as common rules.\18\ FINRA will then confirm in writing 
whether the rules listed in any updated list are common rules as 
defined in the Amended Plan. Under the Amended Plan, MIAX, MIAX Pearl, 
MIAX Emerald, MIAX Sapphire also will provide FINRA with a current list 
of common members and shall update the list no less frequently than 
once each quarter.\19\ The Commission believes that these provisions 
are designed to provide for continuing communication between the 
parties to ensure the continued accuracy of the scope of the proposed 
allocation of regulatory responsibility.
---------------------------------------------------------------------------

    \18\ See paragraph 2 of the Amended Plan.
    \19\ See paragraph 3 of the Amended Plan.
---------------------------------------------------------------------------

    The Commission is hereby declaring effective an Amended Plan that, 
among other things, allocates regulatory responsibility to FINRA for 
the oversight and enforcement of all MIAX, MIAX Pearl, MIAX Emerald, 
and MIAX Sapphire rules that are substantially similar to the rules of 
FINRA for common members of FINRA and MIAX, FINRA and MIAX Pearl, FINRA 
and MIAX Emerald, and FINRA and MIAX Sapphire. Therefore, modifications 
to the Certification need not be filed with the Commission as an 
amendment to the Amended Plan, provided that the parties are only 
adding to, deleting from, or confirming changes to MIAX, MIAX Pearl, 
MIAX Emerald, or MIAX Sapphire rules in the Certification in 
conformance with the definition of common rules provided in the Amended 
Plan. However, should the parties decide to add a MIAX, MIAX Pearl, 
MIAX Emerald, or MIAX Sapphire rule to the Certification that is not 
substantially similar to a FINRA rule; delete a MIAX, MIAX Pearl, MIAX 
Emerald, or MIAX Sapphire rule from the Certification that is 
substantially similar to a FINRA rule; or leave on the Certification a 
MIAX, MIAX Pearl, MIAX Emerald, or MIAX Sapphire rule that is no longer 
substantially similar to a FINRA rule, then such a change would 
constitute an amendment to the Amended Plan, which must be filed with 
the Commission pursuant to Rule 17d-2 under the Act.\20\
---------------------------------------------------------------------------

    \20\ The addition to or deletion from the Certification of any 
federal securities laws, rules, and regulations for which FINRA 
would bear responsibility under the Amended Plan for examining, and 
enforcing compliance by, common members, also would constitute an 
amendment to the Amended Plan.
---------------------------------------------------------------------------

    Under paragraph (c) of Rule 17d-2, the Commission may, after 
appropriate notice and comment, declare a plan, or any part of a plan, 
effective. In this instance, the Commission believes that

[[Page 64035]]

appropriate notice and comment can take place after the proposed 
amendment is effective. In particular, the purpose of the amendment is 
to add MIAX Sapphire as a Participant to the Plan. The Commission notes 
that the most recent prior amendment to the Plan was published for 
comment and the Commission did not receive any comments thereon.\21\ 
The Commission believes that the current amendment to the Plan does not 
raise any new regulatory issues that the Commission has not previously 
considered, and therefore believes that the amended Plan should become 
effective without any undue delay.
---------------------------------------------------------------------------

    \21\ See Securities Exchange Act Release No. 56645 (September 8, 
2020), 85 FR 56645 (September 14, 2020).

IV. Conclusion

    This order gives effect to the Amended Plan filed with the 
Commission in File No. 4-678. The parties shall notify all members 
affected by the Amended Plan of their rights and obligations under the 
Amended Plan.
    It is therefore ordered, pursuant to Section 17(d) of the Act, that 
the Amended Plan in File No. 4-678, between the FINRA, MIAX, MIAX 
Pearl, MIAX Emerald, and MIAX Sapphire, filed pursuant to Rule 17d-2 
under the Act, hereby is approved and declared effective.
    IT IS FURTHER ORDERED that MIAX, MIAX Pearl, MIAX Emerald, and MIAX 
Sapphire are each relieved of those responsibilities allocated to FINRA 
under the Amended Plan in File No. 4-678.

    For the Commission, by the Division of Trading and Markets, 
pursuant to delegated authority.\22\
