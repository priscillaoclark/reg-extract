COMMODITY FUTURES TRADING COMMISSION


Renewal of the Global Markets Advisory Committee

AGENCY: Commodity Futures Trading Commission.

[[Page 67425]]


ACTION: Notice of renewal.

-----------------------------------------------------------------------

SUMMARY: The Commodity Futures Trading Commission (CFTC or Commission) 
is publishing this notice to announce the renewal of the Global Markets 
Advisory Committee (GMAC). The Commission has determined that the 
renewal of the GMAC is necessary and in the public's interest, and the 
CFTC has consulted with the General Services Administration's Committee 
Management Secretariat regarding the GMAC's renewal.

FOR FURTHER INFORMATION CONTACT: Harry Jung, GMAC Designated Federal 
Officer, at 202-394-3995 or <a href="/cdn-cgi/l/email-protection#b2dad8c7dcd5f2d1d4c6d19cd5ddc4"><span class="__cf_email__" data-cfemail="a3cbc9d6cdc4e3c0c5d7c08dc4ccd5">[email&#160;protected]</span></a>.

SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION: The CFTC's advisory committees were created 
to provide input and make recommendations to the Commission on a 
variety of regulatory and market issues that affect the integrity and 
competitiveness of U.S. derivatives markets. The committees facilitate 
communication between the Commission and U.S. derivatives markets, 
trading firms, market participants, and end users. The GMAC is one of 
five CFTC advisory committees. The GMAC's objectives and scope of 
activities are to provide advice and recommendations on matters of 
public concern to the exchanges, firms, market users, other market 
participants, and the Commission regarding the regulatory challenges of 
a global marketplace, which reflect the increasing interconnectedness 
of markets and the multinational nature of business. Through its 
recommendations, the GMAC will help the Commission determine how it can 
avoid unnecessary regulatory or operational impediments to global 
business while still preserving core protections for customers and 
other market participants. The GMAC will also make recommendations for 
appropriate international standards for regulating futures, swaps, 
options, and derivatives markets, as well as intermediaries. 
Additionally, the GMAC will assist the Commission by providing advice 
concerning the impact on U.S. markets and firms of the Commission's 
international efforts and the initiatives of foreign regulators and 
market authorities. The GMAC will also assist with providing advice on 
methods to improve both domestic and international regulatory 
structures while continuing to allow U.S. markets and firms to remain 
competitive in the global market.
    The GMAC will operate for two years from the date of renewal unless 
the Commission directs that the GMAC terminate on an earlier date. A 
copy of the GMAC renewal charter has been filed with the Commission; 
the Senate Committee on Agriculture, Nutrition and Forestry; the House 
Committee on Agriculture; the Library of Congress; and the General 
Services Administration's Committee Management Secretariat. A copy of 
the renewal charter will be posted on the CFTC's website at 
<a href="http://www.cftc.gov">www.cftc.gov</a>.

    Dated: August 15, 2024.
Christopher Kirkpatrick,
Secretary of the Commission.
