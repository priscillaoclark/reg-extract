Background

    On November 3, 1997, the President, invoking the authority of, 
inter alia, the International Emergency Economic Powers Act, 50 U.S.C. 
1701-1706 (``IEEPA''), issued Executive Order 13067 (62 FR 59989, 
November 5, 1997) (``E.O. 13067'') declaring a national emergency with 
respect to the Government of Sudan's policies and actions. These 
policies and actions included supporting international terrorism, 
destabilizing neighboring governments, and committing widespread human 
rights violations. Subsequently, on October 13, 2006, the President 
issued Executive Order 13412 (71 FR 61369, October 17, 2006) (``E.O. 
13412'') to take additional steps with respect to the emergency 
declared in E.O. 13067 and to implement the Darfur Peace and 
Accountability Act of 2006. The Office of Foreign Assets Control 
(``OFAC'') promulgated the Sudanese Sanctions Regulations, 31 CFR part 
538 (the ``SSR''), on July 1, 1998, to implement the provisions of E.O. 
13067. A final rule amending the SSR to implement the provisions of 
E.O. 13412 was published in the Federal Register on October 31, 2007 
(72 FR 61513).
    On April 26, 2006, under the authority of, inter alia, IEEPA and 
section 5 of the United Nations Participation Act, 22 U.S.C. 287c 
(``UNPA''), the President issued Executive Order 13400 (71 FR 25483, 
May 1, 2006) (``E.O. 13400''), effective at 12:01 a.m. eastern daylight 
time on April 27, 2006. At the time that he issued E.O. 13400, the 
President condemned the continued violations of the N'djamena Ceasefire 
Agreement of April 8, 2004, and the Abuja Humanitarian and Security 
Protocols of November 9, 2004, by all sides in Darfur, as well as the 
deterioration of the security situation in Darfur and the negative 
impact this had on humanitarian assistance efforts. The President also 
strongly condemned the continued violence against civilians, including 
sexual violence against women and girls, as noted by the United Nations 
Security Council in Resolution 1591 of March 29, 2005. To deal with the 
threat to the national security and foreign policy of the United States 
posed by this situation, E.O. 13400 expanded the scope of the national 
emergency declared in E.O. 13067 with respect to the policies and 
actions of the Government of Sudan. It also took the additional steps 
of blocking all property and interests in property of certain persons 
in connection with the conflict in Darfur.
    Section 1(a) of E.O. 13400 blocks, with certain exceptions, all 
property and interests in property that are in the United States, that 
come within the United States, or that are or come within the 
possession or control of United States persons of: (1) the persons 
listed in the Annex to E.O. 13400; and (2) any person determined by the 
Secretary of the Treasury, after consultation with the Secretary of 
State:
    <bullet> To have constituted a threat to the peace process in 
Darfur;
    <bullet> To have constituted a threat to stability in Darfur and 
the region;
    <bullet> To be responsible for conduct related to the conflict in 
Darfur that violates international law;
    <bullet> To be responsible for heinous conduct with respect to 
human life or limb related to the conflict in Darfur;
    <bullet> To have directly or indirectly supplied, sold, or 
transferred arms or any related materiel, or any assistance, advice, or 
training related to military activities to: (i) The Government of 
Sudan; (ii) the Sudan Liberation Movement/Army; (iii) the Justice and 
Equality Movement; (iv) the Janjaweed; or (v) any person (other than a 
person listed in (i)-(iv) above) operating in the states of North 
Darfur, South Darfur, or West Darfur that is a belligerent, a 
nongovernmental entity, or an individual;
    <bullet> To be responsible for offensive military overflights in 
and over the Darfur region;
    <bullet> To have materially assisted, sponsored, or provided 
financial, material, or technological support for, or goods or services 
in support of, the activities described above, or any person listed in 
or designated pursuant to E.O. 13400; or
    <bullet> To be owned or controlled by, or acting or purporting to 
act for or on behalf of, directly or indirectly, any person listed in 
or designated pursuant to E.O. 13400.
    In Section 1(b) of E.O. 13400, the President determined that the 
making of donations of certain articles, such as food, clothing, and 
medicine intended to be used to relieve human suffering, as specified 
in section 203(b)(2) of IEEPA, 50 U.S.C. 1702(b)(2), by, to, or for the 
benefit of any person listed in or designated pursuant to E.O. 13400 
would seriously impair his ability to deal with the national emergency 
declared in E.O. 13067 and expanded in E.O. 13400, and the President 
therefore prohibited such donations. Accordingly, the donation of such 
items is prohibited, unless authorized by OFAC.
    Section 1(c) of E.O. 13400 provides that the prohibition on any 
transaction or dealing by a United States person or within the United 
States in blocked property and interests in property includes, but is 
not limited to, the making of any contribution or provision of funds, 
goods, or services by, to, or for the benefit of any person listed in 
or designated pursuant to E.O. 13400, and the receipt of any 
contribution or provision of funds, goods, or services from any such 
person.
    Section 2 of E.O. 13400 prohibits any transaction by a United 
States person or within the United States that evades or avoids, or has 
the purpose of evading or avoiding, or attempts to violate any of the 
prohibitions set forth in E.O. 13400, as well as any conspiracy formed 
to violate such prohibitions.
    Section 5 of E.O. 13400 authorizes the Secretary of the Treasury, 
after consultation with the Secretary of State, to take such actions, 
including the promulgation of rules and regulations, as may be 
necessary to carry out the purposes of E.O. 13400. In furtherance of 
these purposes, OFAC is promulgating these Darfur Sanctions 
Regulations, 31 CFR part 546 (the ``Regulations''). As described above, 
these sanctions are targeted sanctions directed at certain actors in 
connection with the conflict in Darfur, and are separate from the 
Sudanese Sanctions Regulations, 31 CFR part 538.
    Subpart B of the Regulations implements the prohibitions contained 
in sections 1 and 2 of E.O. 13400. See, e.g., Sec. Sec.  546.201 and 
546.205. Persons identified in the Annex to E.O. 13400, designated by 
or under the authority of the Secretary of the Treasury pursuant to 
E.O. 13400, or otherwise subject to the blocking provisions of E.O. 
13400 are referred to throughout the Regulations as ``persons whose 
property and interests in property are blocked pursuant to Sec.  
546.201(a).'' The names of persons listed in or designated pursuant to 
E.O. 13400 are or will be published on OFAC's Specially Designated 
Nationals and Blocked Persons List, which is accessible via OFAC's Web 
site, and can be found at Appendix A to 31 CFR chapter V. Those names 
also have been or will be published in the Federal Register.
    Sections 546.202 and 546.203 of subpart B detail the effect of 
transfers of blocked property in violation of the Regulations and set 
forth the requirement to hold blocked funds, such as currency, bank 
deposits, and

[[Page 25432]]

liquidated financial obligations, in interest-bearing blocked accounts. 
Section 546.204 of subpart B provides that all expenses incident to the 
maintenance of blocked physical property shall be the responsibility of 
the owners or operators of such property, and that such expenses shall 
not be met from blocked funds, unless otherwise authorized. The section 
further provides that blocked property may, in OFAC's discretion, be 
sold or liquidated and the net proceeds placed in a blocked interest-
bearing account in the name of the owner of the property.
    Section 546.205 implements the prohibitions in sections 2(a) and 
2(b) of E.O. 13400 on any transaction by a United States person or 
within the United States that evades or avoids, has the purpose of 
evading or avoiding, or attempts to violate any of the prohibitions set 
forth in E.O. 13400, and on any conspiracy formed to violate such 
prohibitions.
    Subpart C of the Regulations defines key terms used throughout the 
Regulations, and subpart D sets forth interpretive sections regarding 
the general prohibitions contained in subpart B. Section 546.411 sets 
out the rule that the property and interests in property of an entity 
are blocked if the entity is 50 percent or more owned by a person whose 
property and interests in property are blocked, whether or not the 
entity itself is listed in or designated pursuant to E.O. 13400.
    Transactions otherwise prohibited under the Regulations but found 
to be consistent with U.S. policy may be authorized by one of the 
general licenses contained in subpart E or by a specific license issued 
pursuant to the procedures described in subpart E of part 501 of 31 CFR 
chapter V. Subpart E of part 546 also contains certain statements of 
licensing policy, in addition to the general licenses.
    Subpart F of the Regulations refers to subpart C of part 501 for 
applicable recordkeeping and reporting requirements. Subpart G 
describes the civil and criminal penalties applicable to violations of 
the Regulations, as well as the procedures governing the potential 
imposition of a civil monetary penalty. Subpart G also refers to 
Appendix A of part 501 for a more complete description of these 
procedures.
    Subpart H of the Regulations refers to subpart E of part 501 for 
applicable provisions relating to administrative procedures and 
contains a delegation of authority by the Secretary of the Treasury. 
Subpart I of the Regulations sets forth a Paperwork Reduction Act 
notice.

Public Participation

    Because the Regulations involve a foreign affairs function, the 
provisions of Executive Order 12866 and the Administrative Procedure 
Act (5 U.S.C. 553) requiring notice of proposed rulemaking, opportunity 
for public participation, and delay in effective date are inapplicable. 
Because no notice of proposed rulemaking is required for this rule, the 
Regulatory Flexibility Act (5 U.S.C. 601-612) does not apply.

Paperwork Reduction Act

    The collections of information related to the Regulations are 
contained in 31 CFR part 501 (the ``Reporting, Procedures and Penalties 
Regulations''). Pursuant to the Paperwork Reduction Act of 1995 (44 
U.S.C. 3507), those collections of information have been approved by 
the Office of Management and Budget under control number 1505-0164. An 
agency may not conduct or sponsor, and a person is not required to 
respond to, a collection of information unless the collection of 
information displays a valid control number.

List of Subjects in 31 CFR Part 546

    Administrative practice and procedure, Banks, Banking, Blocking of 
assets, Credit, Darfur, Penalties, Reporting and recordkeeping 
requirements, Securities, Services, Sudan.

[[Page 25433]]

of this chapter, the recordkeeping and reporting requirements and

Actions taken pursuant to part 501 of this chapter with respect to the 
prohibitions contained in this part are considered actions taken 
pursuant to this part. Differing foreign policy and national security 
circumstances may result in differing interpretations of similar 
language among the parts of this chapter. No license or authorization 
contained in or issued pursuant to those other parts authorizes any 
transaction prohibited by this part. No license or authorization 
contained in or issued pursuant to any other provision of law or 
regulation authorizes any transaction prohibited by this part. No

relieves the involved parties from complying with any other applicable 
laws or regulations.

Subpart B--Prohibitions


Sec.  546.201  Prohibited transactions involving blocked property.

    (a) Except as authorized by regulations, orders, directives,

    (2) Any person determined by the Secretary of the Treasury, after 
consultation with the Secretary of State:
    (i) To have constituted a threat to the peace process in Darfur;

belligerent, a nongovernmental entity, or an individual;
    (vi) To be responsible for offensive military overflights in and 
over the Darfur region;
    (vii) To have materially assisted, sponsored, or provided 
financial, material, or technological support for, or goods or services

listed in or designated pursuant to Executive Order 13400, whose 
property and interests in property are blocked pursuant to paragraph 
(a) of this section, are published on the Office of Foreign Assets 
Control's Specially Designated Nationals and Blocked Persons List 
(``SDN List'') (which is accessible via the Office of Foreign Assets 
Control's Web site), published in the Federal Register, and 
incorporated into Appendix A to this chapter with the identifier 
``[DARFUR].'' See Sec.  546.411 concerning entities that may not be 
listed on the SDN list but whose property and interests in property 
are nevertheless blocked pursuant to paragraph (a) of this section.


    Note 2 to paragraph (a) of Sec.  546.201: Section 203 of the 
International Emergency Economic Powers Act (50 U.S.C. 1701-1706) 
(``IEEPA'') explicitly authorizes the blocking of property and 
interests in property of a person during the pendency of an 
investigation. The names of persons whose property and interests in 
property are blocked pending investigation pursuant to this part 
also are published on the SDN List, published in the Federal 
Register, and incorporated into Appendix A to this chapter with the 
identifier ``[BPI-DARFUR].''


    Note 3 to paragraph (a) of Sec.  546.201: Sections 501.806 and 
501.807 of this chapter V describe the procedures to be followed by 
persons seeking, respectively, the unblocking of funds that they 
believe were blocked due to mistaken identity, or administrative 
reconsideration of their status as persons whose property and 
interests in property are blocked pursuant to paragraph (a) of this 
section.

    (b) The prohibitions in paragraph (a) of this section include, but 
are not limited to, prohibitions on the following transactions when 
engaged in by a United States person or within the United States:
    (1) The making of any contribution or provision of funds, goods, or 
services by, to, or for the benefit of any person whose property and 
interests in property are blocked pursuant to paragraph (a) of this 
section; and
    (2) The receipt of any contribution or provision of funds, goods, 
or services from any person whose property and interests in property 
are blocked pursuant to paragraph (a) of this section.
    (c) Unless otherwise authorized by this part or by a specific 
license expressly referring to this section, any dealing in any 
security (or evidence thereof) held within the possession or control of 
a U.S. person and either registered or inscribed in the name of, or 
known to be held for the benefit of, or issued by, any person whose 
property and interests in property are blocked pursuant to paragraph 
(a) of this section is prohibited. This prohibition includes but is not 
limited to the transfer (including the transfer on the books of any 
issuer or agent thereof), disposition, transportation, importation, 
exportation, or withdrawal of, or the endorsement or guaranty of 
signatures on, any such security on or after the effective date. This 
prohibition applies irrespective of the fact that at any time (whether 
prior to, on, or subsequent to the effective date) the registered or 
inscribed owner of any such security may have or might appear to have 
assigned, transferred, or otherwise disposed of the security.


Sec.  546.202  Effect of transfers violating the provisions of this 
part.

    (a) Any transfer after the effective date that is in violation of 
any provision of this part or of any regulation, order, directive, 
ruling, instruction, or license issued pursuant to this part, and that 
involves any property or interest in property blocked pursuant to Sec.  
546.201(a), is null and void and shall not be the basis for the 
assertion or recognition of any interest in or right, remedy, power, or 
privilege with respect to such property or property interests.
    (b) No transfer before the effective date shall be the basis for 
the assertion or recognition of any right, remedy, power, or privilege 
with respect to, or any interest in, any property or interest in 
property blocked pursuant to Sec.  546.201(a), unless the person who 
holds or maintains such property, prior to that date, had written 
notice of the transfer or by any written evidence had recognized such 
transfer.
    (c) Unless otherwise provided, an appropriate license or other 
authorization issued by or pursuant to

[[Page 25434]]

the direction or authorization of the Director of the Office of Foreign 
Assets Control before, during, or after a transfer shall validate such 
transfer or make it enforceable to the same extent that it would be 
valid or enforceable but for the provisions of IEEPA, Executive Order 
13400, this part, and any regulation, order, directive, ruling, 
instruction, or license issued pursuant to this part.
    (d) Transfers of property that otherwise would be null and void or 
unenforceable by virtue of the provisions of this section shall not be 
deemed to be null and void or unenforceable as to any person with whom 
such property is or was held or maintained (and as to such person only) 
in cases in which such person is able to establish to the satisfaction 
of the Director of the Office of Foreign Assets Control each of the 
following:
    (1) Such transfer did not represent a willful violation of the 
provisions of this part by the person with whom such property is or was 
held or maintained (and as to such person only);
    (2) The person with whom such property is or was held or maintained 
did not have reasonable cause to know or suspect, in view of all the 
facts and circumstances known or available to such person, that such 
transfer required a license or authorization issued pursuant to this 
part and was not so licensed or authorized, or, if a license or 
authorization did purport to cover the transfer, that such license or 
authorization had been obtained by misrepresentation of a third party 
or withholding of material facts or was otherwise fraudulently 
obtained; and
    (3) The person with whom such property is or was held or maintained 
filed with the Office of Foreign Assets Control a report setting forth 
in full the circumstances relating to such transfer promptly upon 
discovery that:
    (i) Such transfer was in violation of the provisions of this part 
or any regulation, ruling, instruction, license, or other directive or 
authorization issued pursuant to this part;
    (ii) Such transfer was not licensed or authorized by the Director 
of the Office of Foreign Assets Control; or
    (iii) If a license did purport to cover the transfer, such license 
had been obtained by misrepresentation of a third party or withholding 
of material facts or was otherwise fraudulently obtained.

    Note to paragraph (d) of Sec.  546.202: The filing of a report 
in accordance with the provisions of paragraph (d)(3) of this 
section shall not be deemed evidence that the terms of paragraphs 
(d)(1) and (d)(2) of this section have been satisfied.

    (e) Unless licensed pursuant to this part, any attachment, 
judgment, decree, lien, execution, garnishment, or other judicial 
process is null and void with respect to any property in which, on or 
since the effective date, there existed an interest of a person whose 
property and interests in property are blocked pursuant to Sec.  
546.201(a).


Sec.  546.203  Holding of funds in interest-bearing accounts; 
investment and reinvestment.

    (a) Except as provided in paragraph (c) or (d) of this section, or 
as otherwise directed by the Office of Foreign Assets Control, any U.S.

bearing account means a blocked account:
    (i) In a federally-insured U.S. bank, thrift institution, or credit

U.S.C. 78a et seq.), provided the funds are invested in a money market

into a blocked interest-bearing account in accordance with paragraph 
(b) or (d) of this section.
    (d) Blocked funds held in accounts or instruments outside the 
United States at the time the funds become subject to Sec.  546.201(a) 
may continue to be held in the same type of accounts or instruments,

reasonable.
    (e) This section does not create an affirmative obligation for the 
holder of blocked tangible property, such as chattels or real estate, 
or of other blocked property, such as debt or equity securities, to 
sell or liquidate such property. However, the Office of Foreign Assets 
Control may issue licenses permitting or directing such sales or 
liquidation in appropriate cases.
    (f) Funds subject to this section may not be held, invested, or 
reinvested in a manner that provides immediate financial or economic 
benefit or access to any person whose property and interests in 
property are blocked pursuant to Sec.  546.201(a), nor may their holder 
cooperate in or facilitate the pledging or other attempted use as 
collateral of blocked funds or other assets.


Sec.  546.204  Expenses of maintaining blocked physical property; 
liquidation of blocked property.

authorization.
    (b) No regulation, ruling, instruction, or license authorizes any

authorize any transaction prohibited by any other provision of this 
chapter unless the regulation, ruling, instruction, or license 
specifically refers to such provision.
    (c) Any regulation, ruling, instruction, or license authorizing any 
transaction otherwise prohibited under this part has the effect of 
removing a prohibition contained in this part from the transaction, but 
only to the extent specifically stated by its terms. Unless the 
regulation, ruling, instruction, or license otherwise specifies, such 
an authorization does not create any right, duty, obligation, claim, or 
interest in, or with respect to, any property which would not otherwise 
exist under ordinary principles of law.


Sec.  546.503  Exclusion from licenses.

    The Director of the Office of Foreign Assets Control reserves the

Sec.  546.702  Pre-Penalty Notice; settlement.

    (a) When required. If the Office of Foreign Assets Control has 
reason to believe that there has occurred a violation of any provision 
of this part or a violation of the provisions of any license, ruling, 
regulation, order, direction, or instruction issued by or pursuant to 
the direction or authorization of the Secretary of the Treasury 
pursuant to this part or otherwise under IEEPA and determines that a 
civil monetary penalty is warranted, the Office of Foreign Assets 
Control will issue a Pre-Penalty Notice informing the alleged violator 
of the agency's intent to impose a monetary penalty. A Pre-Penalty 
Notice shall be in writing. The Pre-Penalty Notice may be issued 
whether or not another agency has taken any action with respect to the 
matter. For a description of the contents of a Pre-Penalty Notice, see 
Appendix A to part 501 of this chapter.
    (b)(1) Right to respond. An alleged violator has the right to 
respond to a Pre-Penalty Notice by making a written presentation to the 
Office of Foreign Assets Control. For a description of the information 
that should be included in such a response, see Appendix A to part 501 
of this chapter.
    (2) Deadline for response. A response to the Pre-Penalty Notice 
must be made within the applicable 30-day period set forth in this 
paragraph. The failure to submit a response within the applicable time 
period set forth in this paragraph shall be deemed to be a waiver of 
the right to respond.
    (i) Computation of time for response. A response to a Pre-Penalty 
Notice must be postmarked or date-stamped by the U.S. Postal Service 
(or foreign postal service, if mailed abroad) or courier service 
provider (if transmitted to the Office of Foreign Assets Control by 
courier) on or before the 30th day after the postmark date on the 
envelope in which the Pre-Penalty Notice was mailed. If the Pre-Penalty 
Notice was personally delivered by a non-U.S. Postal Service agent 
authorized by the Office of Foreign Assets Control, a response must be 
postmarked or date-stamped on or before the 30th day after the date of 
delivery.
    (ii) Extensions of time for response. If a due date falls on a 
federal holiday or weekend, that due date is extended to include the 
following business day. Any other extensions of time will be granted, 
at the discretion of the Office of Foreign Assets Control, only upon 
specific request to the Office of Foreign Assets Control.
    (3) Form and method of response. A response to a Pre-Penalty Notice 
need not be in any particular form, but it

[[Page 25439]]

must be typewritten and signed by the alleged violator or a 
representative thereof, must contain information sufficient to indicate 
that it is in response to the Pre-Penalty Notice, and must include the 
Office of Foreign Assets Control identification number listed on the 
Pre-Penalty Notice. A copy of the written response may be sent by 
facsimile, but the original also must be sent to the Office of Foreign 
Assets Control Civil Penalties Division by mail or courier and must be 
postmarked or date-stamped, in accordance with paragraph (b)(2) of this 
section.
    (c) Settlement. Settlement discussion may be initiated by the 
Office of Foreign Assets Control, the alleged violator, or the alleged 
violator's authorized representative. For a description of practices 
with respect to settlement, see Appendix A to part 501 of this chapter.
    (d) Guidelines. Guidelines for the imposition or settlement of 
civil penalties by the Office of Foreign Assets Control are contained 
in Appendix A to part 501 of this chapter.
    (e) Representation. A representative of the alleged violator may 
act on behalf of the alleged violator, but any oral communication with 
the Office of Foreign Assets Control prior to a written submission 
regarding the specific allegations contained in the Pre-Penalty Notice 
must be preceded by a written letter of representation, unless the Pre-
Penalty Notice was served upon the alleged violator in care of the 
representative.


Sec.  546.703  Penalty imposition.

    If, after considering any written response to the Pre-Penalty 
Notice and any relevant facts, the Office of Foreign Assets Control 
determines that there was a violation by the alleged violator named in 
the Pre-Penalty Notice and that a civil monetary penalty is 
appropriate, the Office of Foreign Assets Control may issue a written 
Penalty Notice to the violator containing a determination of the 
violation and the imposition of the monetary penalty. For additional 
details concerning issuance of a Penalty Notice, see Appendix A to part 
501 of this chapter. The issuance of the Penalty Notice shall 
constitute final agency action. The violator has the right to seek 
judicial review of that final agency action in Federal district court.


Sec.  546.704  Administrative collection; referral to United States 
Department of Justice.

    In the event that the violator does not pay the penalty imposed 
pursuant to this part or make payment arrangements acceptable to the 
Director of the Office of Foreign Assets Control, the matter may be 
referred for administrative collection measures by the Department of 
the Treasury or to the United States Department of Justice for 
appropriate action to recover the penalty in a civil suit in a Federal 
district court.
