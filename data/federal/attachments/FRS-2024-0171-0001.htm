Final Approval Under OMB Delegated Authority of the Extension for Three 
Years, Without Revision, of the Following Information Collection

    Collection title: Recordkeeping Requirements Associated with 
Regulation F.
    Collection identifier: FR F.
    OMB control number: 7100-0331.
    General description of collection: The Board's Regulation F--
Limitations on Interbank Liabilities (12 CFR part 206) establishes 
limits on depository institutions' credit exposure to individual 
correspondents in order to mitigate the risk that the failure of a 
correspondent would pose to an insured depository institution. Section 
206.3 of Regulation F requires insured depository institutions to 
establish and maintain policies and procedures designed to prevent 
excessive exposure to correspondents.
    Frequency: This information collection contains recordkeeping 
requirements. The creation of written policies and procedures 
concerning interbank liabilities is a mandatory one-time requirement. 
Subsequent changes to these policies and procedures would be on 
occasion, and they must be reviewed and approved by the depository 
institution's board of directors at least annually. The policies and 
procedures must be maintained, as amended.
    Respondents: All depository institutions insured by the Federal 
Deposit Insurance Corporation (FDIC). The Board takes burden under the 
PRA with respect to all such entities.
    Total estimated number of respondents: 4,655.
    Total estimated annual burden hours: 4,753.
    Current actions: On February 16, 2024 the Board published a notice 
in the Federal Register (89 FR 12344) requesting public comment for 60 
days on the extension, without revision, of the FR F. The comment 
period for this notice expired on April 16, 2024. The Board did not 
receive any comments.

    Board of Governors of the Federal Reserve System, June 25, 2024.
Benjamin W. McDonough,
Deputy Secretary and Ombuds of the Board.
