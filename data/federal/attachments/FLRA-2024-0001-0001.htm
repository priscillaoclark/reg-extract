SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION:  The Privacy Act of 1974 requires that each 
agency publish notice of all the systems of records that it maintains. 
This document proposes the introduction of a new system of records. The 
``Freedom of Information Act Request and Appeal Files'' is the system 
that the FLRA uses to provide the public with a single location to 
submit and track Freedom of Information Act (FOIA) and related requests 
and appeals filed with the FLRA. The FLRA had used this single system 
to track Privacy Act requests, which are often combined with FOIA 
requests, see 82 FR 49813 (October 27, 2017). Other agencies have also 
treated Privacy Act and FOIA requests as a singular system of records. 
E.g., Department of Treasury, Freedom of Information Act/Privacy Act 
Request Records, 81 FR 78266 (Nov. 7, 2016).
    The FLRA now proposes a new system of records, titled ``Privacy Act 
Requests and Appeals,'' to separate Privacy Act request records as an 
independent system of records. Pursuant to the Creating Advanced 
Streamlined Electronic Services for Constituents Act of 2019 (``CASES 
Act''), Public Law 116-50, 133 Stat. 1073 (2019), the Office of 
Management and Budget's M-21-04, ``Modernizing Access to and Consent 
for Disclosure of Records Subject to the Privacy Act,'' asks agencies 
to ``provide a digital service option to ensure that individuals have 
the ability to digitally request access to or consent to disclosure of 
their records'' covered by the Privacy Act. M-21-04 also asks agencies 
to ``review SORNs governing systems of records that include Privacy Act 
requests for access to and consent to disclosure of records, and, if 
necessary, modify those SORNs, as well.'' The FLRA determined that a 
separate system

[[Page 919]]

of records should be used to track the documents generated by requests 
under the Privacy Act, which may include different information or use 
different forms than requests under FOIA.

the request of, the individual who is the subject of the record.
    h. To disclose information to the National Archives and Records 
Administration, the Office of Government Information Services (OGIS), 
only when there is overlap between Privacy Act and FOIA requests, to 
the extent necessary to fulfill its responsibilities in 5 U.S.C. 
552(h), to review administrative agency policies, procedures and 
compliance with FOIA, and to facilitate OGIS's offering of mediation 
services to resolve disputes between persons making FOIA requests and 
administrative agencies.
    i. To appropriate agencies, entities, and persons when (1) the FLRA 
suspects or has confirmed that there has been a breach of the system of 
records; (2) the FLRA has determined that as a result of the suspected 
or confirmed breach there is a risk of harm to individuals, the FLRA 
(including its information systems, programs, and operations), the 
Federal Government, or national security; and (3) the disclosure made 
to such agencies, entities, and persons is reasonably necessary to 
assist in connection with the FLRA's efforts to respond to the 
suspected or confirmed breach or to prevent, minimize, or remedy such 
harm.
    j. To another Federal agency or Federal entity, when the FLRA 
determines that information from this system of records is reasonably 
necessary to assist the recipient agency or entity in (1) responding to 
a suspected or confirmed breach or (2) preventing, minimizing, or 
remedying the risk of harm to individuals, the recipient agency or 
entity (including its information systems, programs, and operations),

utilizes security hardware and software, including multiple firewalls, 
active intruder detection, and role-based accessed controls. Any paper 
records are stored in secure FLRA offices and/or lockable file 
cabinets. Given the common overlap between FOIA and Privacy Act

Request and Appeal Files, FLRA/Internal-17.''

POLICIES AND PRACTICES FOR RETRIEVAL OF RECORDS:
    Requests are retrieved from the system by numerous data elements
