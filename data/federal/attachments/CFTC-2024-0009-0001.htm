FOR FURTHER INFORMATION CONTACT: Christina McGlosson, Acting Director, 
Whistleblower Office, Commodity Futures Trading Commission, (202) 418-
5051; email: <a href="/cdn-cgi/l/email-protection#7f1c121c1813100c0c10113f1c190b1c51181009"><span class="__cf_email__" data-cfemail="ea8987898d868599998584aa898c9e89c48d859c">[email&#160;protected]</span></a>, and refer to OMB Control No. 3038-
---------------------------------------------------------------------------
0082.

SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION: 
    Title: The Whistleblower Provision of section 23 of the Commodity 
Exchange Act (OMB Control No. 3038-0082). This is a request for 
extension of a currently approved information collection.
    Abstract: 17 CFR 165.3(a) requires the submission of information to 
the Commission on a Form TCR. The Form TCR, ``Tip, Complaint, or 
Referral,'' and the instructions thereto, are designed to capture basic 
identifying information about a complainant and elicit sufficient 
information to determine whether the conduct alleged suggests a 
violation of the Commodity Exchange Act. 17 CFR 165.7(b)(1) requires 
the submission of information to the Commission on a Form WB-APP. The 
Form WB-APP, ``Application for Award for Original Information Provided 
Pursuant to Section 23 of the Commodity Exchange Act,'' and the 
instructions thereto, are designed to elicit sufficient information to 
determine whether and to what extent a claimant qualifies for a 
whistleblower award.
    An agency may not conduct or sponsor, and a person is not required 
to respond to, a collection of information unless it displays a 
currently valid OMB control number.\2\ On November 21, 2023, the 
Commission published in the Federal Register notice of the proposed 
extension of this information collection and provided 60 days for 
public comment on the proposed extension, 88 FR 81064 (``60-Day 
Notice''). The Commission received one comment requesting individual 
staff feedback on each submission received, in addition to the 
automated reply currently sent by the CFTC as notice of receipt. We 
appreciate the comment but would like to clarify that determinations on 
the submitted applications (including their supplements) are provided 
in due course according to the procedures outlined in 17 CFR part 165. 
Given the non-public nature of investigations, it would not be feasible 
for the CFTC to provide individual feedback on each submission 
received.

    Estimated Average Burden Hours per Respondent: 0.5 hour.

    Frequency of Collection: Once.

    Dated: January 29, 2024.
