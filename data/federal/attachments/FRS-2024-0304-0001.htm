OMB under the PRA. Comments are invited on the following:
    a. Whether the proposed collection of information is necessary for 
the proper performance of the Board's functions, including whether the

Proposal Under OMB Delegated Authority To Extend for Three Years, 
Without Revision, the Following Information Collection

    Collection title: Registration of a Securities Holding Company.
    Collection identifier: FR 2082.
    OMB control number: 7100-0347.
    General description of collection: The FR 2082 registration form is 
used whenever a securities holding company (SHC) elects to register to 
become subject to supervision by the Board pursuant to section 618 of 
the Dodd-Frank Wall Street Reform and Consumer Protection Act (Dodd-
Frank Act). The FR 2082 requests the following from the registering 
SHC: an organization chart (including all subsidiaries); information 
regarding certain of the SHC's subsidiaries; shareholder reports and 
financial statements; information regarding the SHC's shareholders, 
senior officers and directors; information regarding the methods used 
by the SHC to monitor and control its operations; information regarding 
the SHC's foreign subsidiaries that are subject to comprehensive 
consolidated supervision and the regulatory system in which these 
foreign subsidiaries operate; and information regarding any other 
regulatory capital framework to which the SHC is subject. The 
information collected by the FR 2082 registration form is used by the 
Federal Reserve System to determine whether the registrant meets the 
requirements to become a supervised SHC and to complete the 
registration.
    Frequency: Event-generated.
    Respondents: Certain nonbank companies that own at least one 
registered securities broker or dealer and elect to become a supervised 
SHC.
    Total estimated number of respondents: 1.
    Total estimated annual burden hours: 8.

    Board of Governors of the Federal Reserve System, November 12, 
2024.
Benjamin W. McDonough,
Deputy Secretary and Ombuds of the Board.
