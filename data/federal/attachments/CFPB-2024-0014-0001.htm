SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION: 
    Title of Collection: Consumer Response Government and Congressional 
Portal Boarding Forms.
    OMB Control Number: 3170-0057.
    Type of Review: Revision of a currently approved collection.
    Affected Public: State, local, and tribal governments; Federal 
government.
    Estimated Number of Respondents: 60.
    Estimated Total Annual Burden Hours: 14.
    Abstract: Section 1013(b)(3)(A) of the Dodd-Frank Wall Street 
Reform and Consumer Protection Act (Dodd-Frank Act or Act) requires the 
CFPB to ``facilitate the centralized collection of, monitoring of, and 
response to consumer complaints regarding consumer financial products 
or services.'' \1\ The Act also requires the CFPB to ``share consumer 
complaint information with prudential regulators, the Federal Trade 
Commission, other

[[Page 21245]]

Federal agencies, and State agencies.'' \2\ To facilitate the 
collection of complaints, the CFPB accepts consumer complaints 
submitted by Members of Congress on behalf of their constituents with 
the consumer's express written authorization for the release of their 
personal information. In furtherance of its statutory mandates related 
to consumer complaints, the CFPB uses Government and Congressional 
Portal Boarding Forms (i.e., Boarding Forms) to register users for 
access to secure, web-based portals. The CFPB has developed separate 
portals for congressional users and other government users as part of 
its secure web portal offerings (the ``Government Portal'' and the 
``Congressional Portal,'' respectively).\3\
---------------------------------------------------------------------------

    \1\ Codified at 12 U.S.C. 5493(b)(3)(A).
    \2\ Dodd-Frank Act section 1013(b)(3)(D), codified at 12 U.S.C. 
5493(b)(3)(D).
    \3\ In addition to the boarding forms for congressional and 
government users, the CFPB utilizes a separate OMB-approved form to 
board companies onto their own distinct portal to access complaints 
submitted against them, through OMB Control Number 3170-0054 
(Consumer Complaint Intake System Company Portal Boarding Form 
Information Collection System).
---------------------------------------------------------------------------

    Through the Government Portal, government users can view consumer 
complaint information in a user-friendly format that allows easy review 
of complaints currently active in the CFPB process, complaints referred 
to a prudential Federal regulator, and other closed/archived 
complaints.
    Through the Congressional Portal, Members of Congress and 
authorized congressional office staff can view data associated with 
consumer complaints they submit on behalf of their constituents with 
the consumer's express written authorization for the release of their 
personal information. The Congressional Portal only displays 
information about complaints submitted by the individual congressional 
office.
    Changes in this revision reflect the requirements outlined in 12 
CFR 1070.43(b)(2) that requires a citation to the agency's legal 
authority to review, possess, and examine consumer complaints. 
Therefore, new language and fields have been added to the form.
    Request for Comments: Comments are invited on: (a) Whether the 
collection of information is necessary for the proper performance of 
the functions of the CFPB, including whether the information will have 
practical utility; (b) The accuracy of the CFPB's estimate of the 
burden of the collection of information, including the validity of the 
methods and the assumptions used; (c) Ways to enhance the quality, 
utility, and clarity of the information to be collected; and (d) Ways 
to minimize the burden of the collection of information on respondents, 
including through the use of automated collection techniques or other 
forms of information technology. Comments submitted in response to this 
notice will be summarized and/or included in the request for OMB's 
approval. All comments will become a matter of public record.

Anthony May,
Paperwork Reduction Act Officer, Consumer Financial Protection Bureau.
