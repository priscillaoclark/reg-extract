SECURITIES AND EXCHANGE COMMISSION

[SEC File No. 270-669, OMB Control No. 3235-0749]


Submission for OMB Review; Comment Request; Extension: Rule 18a-7

Upon Written Request, Copies Available From: Securities and Exchange 
Commission, Office of FOIA Services,

[[Page 47190]]

100 F Street NE, Washington, DC 20549-2736

    Notice is hereby given that, pursuant to the Paperwork Reduction 
Act of 1995 (``PRA'') (44 U.S.C. 3501 et seq.), the Securities and 
Exchange Commission (``Commission'') has submitted to the Office of 
Management and Budget (``OMB'') a request for approval of extension of 
the previously approved collection of information provided for in Rule 
18a-7, under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 (15 U.S.C. 78a et 
seq.).
    Rule 18a-7 establishes reporting requirements applicable to stand-
alone security-based swap dealers (``SBSDs''), stand-alone major 
security-based swap participants (``MSBSPs''), bank SBSDs, and bank 
MSBSPs. Rule 18a-7 is modeled on Exchange Act Rule 17a-5, which applies 
to broker-dealers, but Rule 18a-7 does not include a parallel 
requirement for every requirement in Rule 17a-5 because some of the 
requirements in Rule 17a-5 relate to activities that are not expected 
or permitted of SBSDs and MSBSPs.
    Under Rule 18a-7, stand-alone SBSDs and stand-alone MSBSPs are 
required to file the FOCUS Report Part II and the annual reports, while 
bank SBSDs and bank MSBSPs are required to file the FOCUS Report Part 
IIC. Stand-alone SBSDs and stand-alone MSBSPs are required to file the 
FOCUS Report Part II on a monthly basis, whereas bank SBSDs and bank 
MSBSPs are required to file FOCUS Report Part IIC on a quarterly basis. 
Moreover, under Rule 18a-7 stand-alone SBSDs and stand-alone MSBSPs are 
required to make available to customers an audited statement of 
financial condition with appropriate notes on their public website.
    The Commission estimates that the total hour burden under Rule 18a-
7 is approximately 2,796 hours per year, and the total cost burden is 
approximately $2,424,016 per year.
    An agency may not conduct or sponsor, and a person is not required 
to respond to, a collection of information under the PRA unless it 
displays a currently valid OMB control number.
    The public may view background documentation for this information 
collection at the following website: <a href="http://www.reginfo.gov">www.reginfo.gov</a>. Find this 
particular information collection by selecting ``Currently under 30-day 
Review--Open for Public Comments'' or by using the search function.

collection should be sent by July 1, 2024 to (i) <a href="http://www.reginfo.gov/public/do/PRAMain">www.reginfo.gov/public/do/PRAMain</a> and (ii) David Bottom, Director/Chief Information

Assistant Secretary.
