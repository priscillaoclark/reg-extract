Submission for OMB Review; Comment Request; Extension: Form 15

Upon Written Request Copies Available From: Securities and Exchange 
Commission, Office of FOIA Services, 100 F Street NE, Washington, DC 
20549-2736

    Notice is hereby given that, pursuant to the Paperwork Reduction 
Act of 1995 (44 U.S.C. 3501 et seq.), the Securities and Exchange 
Commission (``Commission'') has submitted to the Office of Management 
and Budget this request for extension of the previously approved 
collection of information discussed below.
    Form 15 (17 CFR 249.323) is a certification of termination of a 
class of security under Section 12(g) or notice of suspension of duty 
to file reports pursuant to Sections 13 and 15(d) of the Securities 
Exchange Act of 1934 (15 U.S.C. 78a et seq.). All information is 
provided to the public for review. We estimate that approximately 684 
issuers file Form 15 annually and it takes approximately 1.5 hours per 
response to prepare for a total of 1,026 annual burden hours (1.5 hours 
per response x 1,026 responses).
    An agency may not conduct or sponsor, and a person is not required 
to respond to, a collection of information unless it displays a 
currently valid control number.
    The public may view background documentation for this information 
collection at the following website: <a href="http://www.reginfo.gov">www.reginfo.gov</a>. Find this 
particular information collection by selecting ``Currently under 30-day 
Review--Open for Public Comments'' or by using the search function. 
Written comments and recommendations for the proposed information 
collection should be sent within 30 days of publication of this notice 
by July 29, 2024 to (i) <a href="http://www.reginfo.gov/public/do/PRAMain">www.reginfo.gov/public/do/PRAMain</a> and (ii)
