SECURITIES AND EXCHANGE COMMISSION

[SEC File No. 270-349, OMB Control No. 3235-0395]


Proposed Collection; Comment Request; Extension: Rule 15g-6

Upon Written Request, Copies Available From: Securities and Exchange 
Commission, Office of FOIA Services, 100 F Street NE, Washington, DC 
20549-2736.

    Notice is hereby given that pursuant to the Paperwork Reduction Act 
of 1995 (``PRA'') (44 U.S.C. 3501 et seq.), the Securities and Exchange 
Commission (``Commission'') is soliciting comments on the existing 
collection of information provided for in Rule 15g-6--Account 
Statements for Penny Stock Customers--(17 CFR 240.15g-6) under the 
Securities Exchange Act of 1934 (15 U.S.C. 78a et seq.). The Commission 
plans to submit this existing collection of information to the Office 
of Management and Budget (``OMB'') for extension and approval.
    Rule 15g-6 requires brokers and dealers that sell penny stocks to 
provide their customers monthly account statements containing 
information with regard to the penny stocks held in customer accounts. 
The purpose of the rule is to increase the level of disclosure to 
investors concerning penny stocks generally and specific penny stock 
transactions.
    The Commission estimates that approximately 170 broker-dealers will 
spend an average of approximately 78 hours annually to comply with this 
rule. Thus, the total compliance burden is approximately 13,260 burden-
hours per year.
    Written comments are invited on: (a) whether the proposed 
collection of information is necessary for the proper performance of 
the functions of the Commission, including whether the information 
shall have practical utility; (b) the accuracy of the Commission's 
estimates of the burden of the proposed collection of information; (c) 
ways to enhance the quality, utility, and clarity of the information 
collected; and (d) ways to minimize the burden of the collection of 
information on respondents, including through the use of automated 
collection techniques or other forms of information technology. 
Consideration will be given to comments and suggestions submitted by 
August 19, 2024.
    An agency may not conduct or sponsor, and a person is not required 
to respond to, a collection of information under the PRA unless it 
displays a currently valid OMB control number.
    Please direct your written comments to: David Bottom, Director/
Chief Information Officer, Securities and Exchange Commission, c/o John 
Pezzullo, 100 F Street NE, Washington, DC 20549, or send an email to:

    Dated: June 12, 2024.
Sherry R. Haywood,
Assistant Secretary.
