FEDERAL RESERVE SYSTEM


Proposed Agency Information Collection Activities; Comment 
Request

AGENCY: Board of Governors of the Federal Reserve System.
SUMMARY: Background: On June 15, 1984, the Office of Management and 
Budget (OMB) delegated to the Board of Governors of the Federal Reserve 
System (Board) its approval authority under the Paperwork Reduction Act 
(PRA), as per 5 CFR 1320.16, to approve of and assign OMB control 
numbers to collection of information requests and requirements 
conducted or sponsored by the Board under conditions set forth in 5 CFR 
part 1320 appendix A.1. Board-approved collections of information are 
incorporated into the official OMB inventory of currently approved 
collections of information. Copies of the Paperwork Reduction Act 
Submission, supporting statements and approved collection of 
information instruments are placed into OMB's public docket files. The 
Federal Reserve may not conduct or sponsor, and the respondent is not 
required to respond to, an information collection that has been 
extended, revised, or implemented on or after October 1, 1995, unless 
it displays a currently valid OMB control number.

Request for Comment On Information Collection Proposals

    The following information collections, which are being handled 
under this delegated authority, have received initial Board approval 
and are hereby published for comment. At the end of the comment period, 
the proposed information collections, along with an analysis of 
comments and recommendations received, will be submitted to the Board 
for final approval under OMB delegated authority. Comments are invited 
on the following:
    a. Whether the proposed collection of information is necessary for 
the proper performance of the Federal Reserve's functions; including 
whether the information has practical utility;
    b. The accuracy of the Federal Reserve's estimate of the burden of 
the proposed information collection, including the validity of the 
methodology and assumptions used;
    c. Ways to enhance the quality, utility, and clarity of the 
information to be collected; and
    d. Ways to minimize the burden of information collection on 
respondents, including through the use of automated collection 
techniques or other forms of information technology.

    Proposal to approve under OMB delegated authority the extension for 
three years, without revision, of the following report:
    Report title: Recordkeeping Requirements Associated with the Real 
Estate Lending Standards Regulation for State Member Banks.
    Agency form number: Reg H-5.
    OMB control number: 7100-0261.
    Frequency: Aggregate report, quarterly; policy statement, annually.
    Reporters: State member banks.
    Estimated annual reporting hours: 16,860 hours.
    Estimated average hours per response: Aggregate report: 5 hours; 
Policy statement: 20 hours.
    Number of respondents: 843.
    General description of report: This information collection is 
mandatory pursuant to section 304 of the Federal Deposit Insurance 
Corporation Improvement Act of 1991 (FDICIA) (12 U.S.C. 1828(o)) which 
authorizes the Federal Reserve to require the recordkeeping 
requirements associated with the Board's Regulation H (12 CFR 208.51). 
Since the information is not collected by the Federal Reserve, no issue 
of confidentiality under the Freedom of Information Act (FOIA) arises. 
However, information gathered by the Federal Reserve during 
examinations of state member banks would be deemed exempt from 
disclosure under exemption 8 of FOIA. 5 U.S.C. 552(b)(8). In addition, 
exemptions 4 and 6 of FOIA, (5 U.S.C. 552(b)(4) and (b)(6)) also may 
apply to certain data (specifically, individual loans identified as in 
excess of supervisory loan-to-value limits) collected in response to 
these requirements if gathered by the Federal Reserve, depending on the 
particular circumstances. These exemptions relate to confidential 
commercial and financial information, and personal information, 
respectively. Applicability of these exemptions would be determined on 
a case-by-case basis.
    Abstract: State member banks must adopt and maintain a written real 
estate lending policy. Also, banks must identify their loans in excess 
of the supervisory loan-to-value limits and report (at least quarterly) 
the aggregate amount of the loans to the bank's board of directors.
    Proposal to approve under OMB delegated authority the extension for 
three years, with minor revision, of the following reports:
    1. Report title: Application for Employment with the Board of 
Governors of the Federal Reserve System.
    Agency form numbers: FR 28, FR 28s, FR 28i.
    OMB control number: 7100-0181.
    Frequency: On Occasion.
    Reporters: Employment applicants.
    Annual reporting hours: 3,558 hours.
    Estimated average hours per response: FR 28: 1 hour; FR 28s: 1 
minute; FR 28i: 5 minutes.
    Number of respondents: FR 28: 3,500; FR 28s: 2,000; FR 28i: 300.
    General description of report: This information collection is 
required to obtain a benefit and is authorized pursuant to Sections 10 
and 11 of the Federal Reserve Act (12 U.S.C. 244 and 248(1)). 
Information provided will be kept confidential under exemption (b)(6) 
of the FOIA to the extent that the disclosure of information ``would 
constitute a clearly unwarranted invasion of personal privacy.'' 5 
U.S.C. 552(b)(6).
    Abstract: The Application collects information to determine the 
qualifications and availability of applicants for employment with the 
Board such as information on education and training, employment record, 
military service record, and other information since the time the 
applicant left high school. Included with the Application are two 
supplemental questionnaires: (1) The Applicant's Voluntary Self-
Identification Form (FR 28s), which collects information on the 
applicant's gender and ethnic group and (2) The Research Assistant 
Candidate Survey of Interests (FR 28i), which collects information from 
candidates applying for Research Assistant positions on their level of 
interest in economics and related areas.
    Current Actions: The Federal Reserve proposes minor revision to the 
FR 28i by (1) expanding the list of research topics of interest to 
candidates, (2) updating the list of software packages and statistical 
languages used by candidates, and (3) eliminating the portion of the 
survey that asks for the future objective of the candidates.
    2. Report title: Ongoing Intermittent Survey of Households.
    Agency form numbers: FR 3016.
    OMB control number: 7100-0150.
    Frequency: On Occasion.
    Reporters: Households and individuals.
    Annual reporting hours: 633 hours.
    Estimated average hours per response: Division of Research & 
Statistics, 1.58 minutes; Division of Consumer & Community Affairs 
(DCCA), 3 minutes; Other divisions, 5 minutes; and Non-SRC surveys, 90 
minutes.
    Number of respondents: 500.
    General description of report: This information collection is 
voluntary (12 U.S.C. 225a, 263 and 15 U.S.C. 1691b). No issue of 
confidentiality normally arises because names and any other 
characteristics that would permit personal identification of 
respondents are not reported to the Federal Reserve Board. However, 
exemption 6 of the FOIA (5 U.S.C. 552(b)(6)) would exempt this 
information from disclosure.
    Abstract: The Federal Reserve uses this voluntary survey to obtain 
household-based information specifically tailored to the Federal 
Reserve's policy, regulatory, and operational responsibilities. 
Currently, the University of Michigan's Survey

[[Page 70921]]

Research Center (SRC) includes survey questions on behalf of the 
Federal Reserve in an addendum to their regular monthly Survey of 
Consumer Attitudes and Expectations. The SRC conducts the survey by 
telephone with a sample of 500 households and asks questions of special 
interest to the Federal Reserve intermittently, as needed. The 
frequency and content of the questions depend on changing economic, 
regulatory, and legislative developments. The Federal Reserve primarily 
uses the survey to study consumer financial decisions, attitudes, and 
payment behavior.
    Current Actions: The Federal Reserve proposes to revise the FR 3016 
by decreasing the number of SRC surveys that would be conducted per 
year by DCCA from four to two. This decrease is due to DCCA's 
restructuring of its research function as a result of the Dodd-Frank 
Wall Street Reform and Consumer Protection Act.

    Board of Governors of the Federal Reserve System, November 16, 
2010.
Jennifer J. Johnson,
Secretary of the Board.
