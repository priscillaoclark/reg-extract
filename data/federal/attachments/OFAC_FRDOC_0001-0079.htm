Background

    The Kingpin Act became law on December 3, 1999. The Kingpin Act 
establishes a program targeting the activities of significant foreign 
narcotics traffickers and their organizations on a worldwide basis. It 
provides a statutory framework for the President to impose sanctions 
against significant foreign narcotics traffickers and their 
organizations on a worldwide basis, with the objective of denying their 
businesses and agents access to the U.S. financial system and to the 
benefits of trade and transactions involving U.S. companies and 
individuals.
    The Kingpin Act blocks all property and interests in property, 
subject to U.S. jurisdiction, owned or controlled by significant 
foreign narcotics traffickers as identified by the President. In 
addition, the Secretary of the Treasury

[[Page 36826]]

consults with the Attorney General, the Director of the Central 
Intelligence Agency, the Director of the Federal Bureau of 
Investigation, the Administrator of the Drug Enforcement 
Administration, the Secretary of Defense, the Secretary of State, and 
the Secretary of Homeland Security when designating and blocking the 
property and interests in property, subject to U.S. jurisdiction, of 
persons who are found to be: (1) Materially assisting in, or providing 
financial or technological support for or to, or providing goods or 
services in support of, the international narcotics trafficking 
activities of a person designated pursuant to the Kingpin Act; (2) 
owned, controlled, or directed by, or acting for or on behalf of, a 
person designated pursuant to the Kingpin Act; or (3) playing a 
significant role in international narcotics trafficking.
    On July 20, 2009, OFAC designated 4 individuals whose property and 
interests in property are blocked pursuant to section 805(b) of the 
Foreign Narcotics Kingpin Designation Act.
