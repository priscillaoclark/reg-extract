SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION: 
    Title of Collection: Consumer Leasing Act (Regulation M).
    OMB Control Number: 3170-0006.
    Type of Review: Extension without change of a currently approved 
collection.
    Affected Public: Businesses and other for-profit entities.
    Estimated Number of Respondents: 13,301.
    Estimated Total Annual Burden Hours: 2,062.
    Abstract: Consumers rely on the disclosures required by the 
Consumer Leasing Act (CLA) \1\ and Regulation M \2\ for information to 
comparison shop among leases as well as to ascertain the true costs and 
terms of lease offers. Federal/State enforcement and private litigants 
use the records to ascertain whether accurate and complete disclosures 
of the cost of leases have been provided to consumers prior to 
consummation of the lease. This information provides the primary 
evidence of law violations in CLA enforcement actions brought by 
Federal agencies. The agency's ability to enforce the CLA would be 
significantly impaired without Regulation M's recordkeeping 
requirements.

    \1\ 15 U.S.C. 1667 et seq.
    \2\ 12 CFR 1013.

    Request for Comments: Comments are invited on: (a) Whether the 
collection of information is necessary for the proper performance of 
the functions of the CFPB, including whether the information will have 
practical utility; (b) The accuracy of the CFPB's estimate of the 
burden of the collection of information, including the validity of the 
methods and the assumptions used; (c) Ways to enhance the quality, 
utility, and clarity of the information to be collected; and (d) Ways 
to minimize the burden of the collection of information on respondents, 
including through the use of automated collection techniques or other 
forms of information technology. Comments submitted in response to this 
notice will be summarized and/or included in the request for OMB's 
approval. All comments will become a matter of public record.

Anthony May,
Paperwork Reduction Act Officer, Consumer Financial Protection Bureau.
