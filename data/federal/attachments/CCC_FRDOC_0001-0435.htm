Domestic Sugar Program--2023 Cane Sugar Marketing Allotments and 
Cane and Beet Processor Allocations

AGENCY: Commodity Credit Corporation, USDA.

ACTION: Notice.

-----------------------------------------------------------------------

SUMMARY: The United States Department of Agriculture (USDA) is issuing 
this notice to increase the fiscal year 2023 (FY23) overall sugar 
marketing allotment quantity (OAQ); increase beet and State cane sugar 
allotments; revise company allocations to sugar beet and sugar cane 
processors; and reassign beet and cane sugar marketing allocations to 
raw cane sugar imports already anticipated. These actions apply to all 
domestic beet and cane sugar marketed for human consumption in the 
United States from October 1, 2022, through September 30, 2023.

FOR FURTHER INFORMATION CONTACT: Kent Lanclos; telephone, (202) 720-
0114; or email, <a href="/cdn-cgi/l/email-protection#3f545a514b11535e515c53504c7f4a4c5b5e11585049"><span class="__cf_email__" data-cfemail="95fef0fbe1bbf9f4fbf6f9fae6d5e0e6f1f4bbf2fae3">[email&#160;protected]</span></a>. Individuals who require 
alternative means for communication should contact the USDA Target 
Center at (202) 720-2600 (voice and text telephone (TTY)) or dial 711 
for Telecommunications Relay Service (both voice and text telephone 
users can initiate this call from any telephone).

SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION: On September 30, 2022, USDA announced the 
initial FY23 OAQ, which was established at 10,646,250 short tons, raw 
value, (STRV) equal to 85 percent of the estimated quantity of sugar 
for domestic human consumption for the fiscal year of 12,525,000 STRV 
as forecast in the September 2022 World Agricultural Supply and Demand 
Estimates report (WASDE). The Agricultural Adjustment Act of 1938 (Pub. 
L. 75-430) requires that 54.35 percent of the OAQ be distributed among 
beet processors and 45.65 percent be distributed among the sugarcane 
States and cane processors.
    In the March 2023 WASDE release, USDA increased the FY23 estimate 
of sugar consumption for food use to 12,600,000 STRV. As a result, USDA 
is increasing the FY23 OAQ to 10,710,000 STRV. The revised beet sector 
allotment is 5,820,885 STRV (an increase of 34,648) and the revised 
cane sector allotment is 4,889,115 STRV (an increase of 29,102). The 
revised beet and cane sector allotments are distributed to individual 
processors according to statutory formulas as shown in the table below 
(see the column labeled ``Preliminary Revised Allocation'').
    In accordance with section 359e of the Agricultural Adjustment Act 
of 1938 (7 U.S.C. 1359ee), after evaluating each sugar beet processor's 
ability to market its full allocation, USDA is transferring FY23 
allocations from sugar beet processors with surplus allocation to those 
with deficit allocation listed in the table below. USDA has also 
determined

[[Page 21605]]

that domestic beet sugar supplies are inadequate to fill the FY23 beet 
sugar marketing allotment.
    In accordance with 7 U.S.C. 1359ee(b)(2), USDA is reassigning 
250,000 STRV of the deficit to raw cane sugar imports already 
anticipated, given the absence of any Commodity Credit Corporation 
(CCC) stocks of sugar. In the table below, each sugar beet processor's 
allocation following these changes is shown in the column labeled 
``Revised FY23 Allocations'' and the amount of change in each 
processor's allocation in the column labeled ``Reassigned Amount.''
    In accordance with section 7 U.S.C. 1359ee(b)(1), after evaluating 
each sugarcane processor's ability to market its full allocation, USDA 
is transferring FY23 allocations from sugarcane processors with surplus 
allocation to those with deficit allocation in the table below. USDA 
has also determined that domestic cane sugar supplies are inadequate to 
fill the FY23 cane sugar marketing allotment.
    In accordance with 7 U.S.C. 1359ee(b)(1), USDA is reassigning 
500,000 STRV of the deficit to raw cane sugar imports already 
anticipated, given the absence of any CCC stocks of sugar. In the 
table, each sugarcane processor's allocation following these changes is 
shown in the column labeled ``Revised FY23 Allocations'' and the amount 
of change in each processor's allocation in the column labeled 
``Reassigned Amount.''

    These FY23 sugar marketing allotment program actions will not 
prevent any domestic sugarcane or sugar beet processor from marketing 
all of its FY23 sugar supply. USDA will closely monitor stocks, 
consumption, imports, and all sugar market and program variables on an 
ongoing basis and may make further program adjustments during FY23, if 
needed.
