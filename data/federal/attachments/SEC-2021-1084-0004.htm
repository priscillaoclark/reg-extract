SECURITIES AND EXCHANGE COMMISSION

[SEC File No. 270-662, OMB Control No. 3235-0720]


Submission for OMB Review; Comment Request; Extension: Form 1-K

Upon Written Request Copies Available From: Securities and Exchange 
Commission, Office of FOIA Services, 100 F Street NE, Washington, DC 
20549-2736

    Notice is hereby given that, pursuant to the Paperwork Reduction 
Act of 1995 (44 U.S.C. 3501 et seq.), the Securities and Exchange 
Commission (``Commission'') has submitted to the Office of Management 
and Budget this request for extension of the previously approved 
collection of information discussed below.
    Form 1-K (17 CFR 239.91) is used to file annual reports by Tier 2 
issuers under Regulation A, an exemption from registration under the 
Securities Act of 1933 (15 U.S.C. 77a et seq.). Tier 2 issuers under 
Regulation A conducting offerings of up to $50 million within a 12-
month period are required to file Form 1-K. Form 1-K provides audited 
year-end financial statements and information about the issuer's 
business operation, ownership, management, liquidity, capital resources 
and operations on an annual basis. In addition, Part I of the Form 1-K 
collects information on any offerings under Regulation A that have been 
terminated or completed unless it has been previous reported on Form 1-
Z. The purpose of the Form 1-K is to better inform the public about 
companies that have conducted Tier 2 offerings under Regulation A. We 
estimate that approximately 353 issuers file Form 1-K annually. We 
estimate that Form 1-K takes approximately 600 hours to prepare. We 
estimate that 75% of the 600 hours per response (450 hours) is prepared 
by the company for a total annual burden of 158,850 hours (450 hours 
per response x 353 responses).
    An agency may not conduct or sponsor, and a person is not required 
to respond to, a collection of information unless it displays a 
currently valid control number.
    Public Comment Instructions: The 30-day public comment period for 
this information collection request opens on December 12, 2024 and 
closes at the end of the day on January 13, 2025. The public may view 
the full information request and submit comments at <a href="https://www.reginfo.gov/public/do/PRAViewICR?ref_nbr=202412-3235-004">https://www.reginfo.gov/public/do/PRAViewICR?ref_nbr=202412-3235-004</a> or email

Assistant Secretary.
