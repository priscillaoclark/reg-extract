SECURITIES AND EXCHANGE COMMISSION

[SEC File No. 270-629, OMB Control No. 3235-0719]


Proposed Collection; Comment Request; Extension: Rules 13n-1-13n-
12; Form SDR

Upon Written Request, Copies Available From: Securities and Exchange 
Commission, Office of FOIA Services, 100 F Street NE, Washington, DC 
20549-2736

    Notice is hereby given that pursuant to the Paperwork Reduction Act 
of 1995 (``PRA'') (44 U.S.C. 3501 et seq.), the Securities and Exchange 
Commission (``Commission'') is soliciting comments on the existing 
collection of information provided for in Rules 13n-1 through 13n-12 
(17 CFR 240.13n-1 through 240.13n-12) and Form SDR (``Rules''), under 
the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 (15 U.S.C. 78m(n)(3) et seq.). The 
Commission plans to submit this existing collection of information to 
the Office of Management and Budget (``OMB'') for extension and 
approval.
    Under the Rules, security-based swap data repositories (``SDRs'') 
are required to register with the Commission by filing a completed Form 
SDR (the filing of a completed Form SDR also constitutes an application 
for registration as a securities information processor (``SIP'')). SDRs 
are also required to abide by certain minimum standards set out in the 
Rules, including a requirement to update Form SDR, abide by certain 
duties and core principles, maintain data in accordance with the rules, 
keep systems in accordance with the Rules, keep records, provide 
reports to the Commission, maintain the privacy of security-based swaps 
(``SBSs'') data, make certain disclosures, and designate a Chief 
Compliance Officer. In addition, there are a number of collections of 
information contained in the Rules. The information collected pursuant 
to the Rules is necessary to carry out the mandates of the Dodd-Frank 
Act and help ensure an orderly and transparent market for SBSs.
    Assuming a maximum of three SDRs, the Commission estimates that the 
total burden for the Rules and Form SDR for all respondents is 127,505 
hours annually and approximately 382,511 burden hours for all 
respondents over three years. In addition, the Commission estimates 
that the total cost of the Rules and Form SDR for all respondents is 
approximately $29,905,416 annually and approximately $89,716,248 for 
all respondents over three years.
    Written comments are invited on: (a) whether the proposed 
collection of information is necessary for the proper performance of 
the functions of the Commission, including whether the information 
shall have practical utility; (b) the accuracy of the Commission's 
estimates of the burden of the proposed collection of information; (c) 
ways to enhance the quality, utility, and clarity of the information 
collected; and (d) ways to minimize the burden of the collection of 
information on respondents, including through the use of automated 
collection techniques or other forms of information technology. 
Consideration will be given to comments and suggestions submitted by 
September 9, 2024.
    An agency may not conduct or sponsor, and a person is not required 
to respond to, a collection of information under the PRA unless it 
displays a currently valid OMB control number.
    Please direct your written comments to: Austin Gerig, Director/
Chief Data Officer, Securities and Exchange Commission, c/o Oluwaseun 
Ajayi, 100 F Street NE, Washington, DC 20549, or send an email to:

Assistant Secretary.
