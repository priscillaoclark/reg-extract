SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION: We are adopting an updated Filer Manual,

17 CFR 232.301 (``Rule 301''). The updated Filer Manual is incorporated 
by reference into the Code of Federal Regulations.

I. Background

    The Filer Manual contains information needed for filers to make 
submissions on EDGAR. Filers must comply with the applicable provisions 
of the Filer Manual in order to assure the timely acceptance and 
processing of filings made in electronic format.\1\ Filers must consult 
the Filer Manual in conjunction with our rules governing mandated 
electronic filings when preparing documents for electronic submission.
---------------------------------------------------------------------------

    \1\ See Rule 301 of Regulation S-T.
---------------------------------------------------------------------------

II. EDGAR System Changes and Associated Modifications to Volume II of 
the Filer Manual

    EDGAR is being updated in EDGAR Release 24.1, and corresponding 
amendments to Volume II of the Filer Manual are being made to reflect 
these changes, as described below.\2\
---------------------------------------------------------------------------

    \2\ EDGAR Release 24.1 was deployed on [Mar. 18, 2024].
---------------------------------------------------------------------------

Inline XBRL Mandate for Financial Statements and Schedules Required by 
Form 11-K

    On June 2, 2022, the Commission adopted amendments to its rules 
governing the electronic filing and submission of documents to require 
the use of Inline eXtensible Business Reporting Language (``Inline 
XBRL'') for the filing of the financial statements and accompanying 
schedules to the financial statements required by Form 11-K.\3\ EDGAR 
will be updated to allow filers to file submission form types 11-K, 11-
KT, 11-K/A, and 11-KT/A in Inline XBRL format.
---------------------------------------------------------------------------

    \3\ Updating EDGAR Filing Requirements and Form 144 Filings, 
Release No. 33-11070 (June 2, 2022) [87 FR 35393 (June 10, 2022)].
---------------------------------------------------------------------------

Shortening the Securities Transaction Settlement Cycle

    In furtherance of the Commission's rule requiring clearing agencies 
that provide a central matching service to establish, implement, 
maintain, and enforce policies and procedures reasonably designed to 
facilitate straight-matching processing, filers will be able to file 
submission form types 17AD-27 and 17AD-27/A in an Inline XBRL format 
that includes the data elements described in Rule 17Ad-27(b)(1) through 
(5).\4\ These form types will allow the filer to request confidential 
treatment on sections of the document that the filer does not want to 
be publicly disseminated.
---------------------------------------------------------------------------

    \4\ Shortening the Securities Transaction Settlement Cycle, 
Release No. 34-96930 (Feb.15, 2023) [88 FR 13872 (Mar. 6, 2023)].
---------------------------------------------------------------------------

Extending Schedules 13D and 13G EDGAR Filing Hours

    Consistent with the Commission's amendments to rules that govern 
beneficial ownership reporting,\5\ on February 5, 2024, EDGAR underwent 
software changes to extend the filing ``cut-off'' times for Schedule 
13D, Schedule 13G, and corresponding amendments from 5:30 p.m. Eastern 
time to 10 p.m. eastern time. In accordance with this software change, 
the EDGAR Filer Manual will be revised to include references to SC 13D, 
SC 13G, SC 13D/A, SC 13G/A, SCHEDULE 13D, SCHEDULE 13D/A, SCHEDULE 13G, 
and SCHEDULE 13G/A as submission types that will have a ``Filing Date'' 
identical to the EDGAR ``Received Date'' even if received after 5:30 
p.m. eastern time, and will be disseminated until 10 p.m. eastern time.
---------------------------------------------------------------------------

    \5\ Modernization of Beneficial Ownership Reporting, Release No. 
33-11253 (Oct. 10, 2023) [88 FR 76896 (Nov. 7, 2023)].
---------------------------------------------------------------------------

Share Repurchase Disclosure Modernization

    References to submission types F-SR and F-SR/A, Exhibit 26 of Form 
10-K and 10-Q, and the SHR taxonomy were removed from the EDGAR Filer 
Manual as a result of the United States Court of Appeals for the Fifth 
Circuit ruling \6\ vacating the Share Repurchase Disclosure 
Modernization rule.\7\ Further, the SHR taxonomy has been removed from 
EDGAR.

Cir., Dec. 19, 2023).

97424 (May 3, 2023) [88 FR 36002 (June 1, 2023)].
---------------------------------------------------------------------------

    General functional enhancements to EDGAR Release 24.1 are set forth 
below.

Revision of Filer Manual Volume II, Chapter 6, and Relocation of 
Technical Content

    Chapter 6 of the Filer Manual, Interactive Data, will be revised to 
remove technical and instructional details of XBRL formatting and 
validation. The information to be removed from Chapter 6 consists of 
technical specifications and guidance that filers will be able to 
consult in a new EDGAR XBRL Guide on <a href="http://SEC.gov">SEC.gov</a>. The revised Chapter 6 
will present XBRL content in a concise fashion and will continue to 
complement Chapter 3, Index to Forms, by identifying different XBRL 
formatted documents associated with relevant EDGAR form and submission 
types. The revised Chapter 6 will also make clear that Interactive Data 
submissions in EDGAR use the Extensible Business Reporting Language 
(``XBRL'') information model and explain the use of taxonomies and 
instances which comprise this model.

Taxonomy Update

    The EDGAR system will be updated to accept the 2024 versions of the 
following taxonomies:

[cir] US-GAAP, SRT (published by FASB)
[cir] CEF, COUNTRY, CURRENCY, DEI, ECD, EXCH, FFD, FND, NAICS, OEF, 
RXP, SIC, SNJ, SRO, STPR, VIP (published by SEC) \8\
---------------------------------------------------------------------------

    \8\ See <a href="https://www.sec.gov/edgar/information-for-filers/standard-taxonomies">https://www.sec.gov/edgar/information-for-filers/standard-taxonomies</a>.

    EDGAR will also accept validations based on FASB's 2024 XBRL US 
Data Quality Committee Rules Taxonomy (DQCRT).

<bullet> Updates to Table 7-1 of the Filer Manual

    The EDGAR Filer Manual reference to 8-K and 1-U Items will be 
updated in Table 7-1: Information Fields Available on Main Page.
    On January 29, 2024, EDGAR Release 24.0.1 introduced the following 
changes, in addition to those noted in the December 2023 Filer Manual 
update:
    <bullet> The check box labeled ``Attach Inline XBRL Fee Tagging 
Exhibit'' on the EDGARLink Online ``Documents'' tab was renamed to 
``Attach Inline XBRL Filing Fee Exhibit'' for the 72 fee bearing 
submission types impacted.

[[Page 28608]]

    <bullet> Submission type SC 13E1 has been updated to remove the 
``Is Fee Table/Exhibit included?'' check box from the ``Main'' tab of 
the EDGARLink Online interface. As a result, filers are now required to 
attach an EX-FILING FEES exhibit attachment on a SC 13E1 filing.

III. Amendments to Rule 301 of Regulation S-T

    Along with the adoption of the updated Filer Manual, we are 
amending Rule 301 of Regulation S-T to provide for the incorporation by 
reference into the Code of Federal Regulations of the current 
revisions. This incorporation by reference was approved by the Director 
of the Federal Register in accordance with 5 U.S.C. 552(a) and 1 CFR 
part 51.
    The updated EDGAR Filer Manual is available at <a href="https://www.sec.gov/edgar/filerinformation/current-edgar-filer-manual">https://www.sec.gov/edgar/filerinformation/current-edgar-filer-manual</a>.

IV. Administrative Law Matters

    Because the Filer Manual and rule amendments relate solely to 
agency procedures or practice and do not substantially alter the rights 
and obligations of non-agency parties, publication for notice and 
comment is not required under the Administrative Procedure Act 
(``APA'').\9\ It follows that the amendments do not require analysis 
under requirements of the Regulatory Flexibility Act \10\ or a report 
to Congress under the Small Business Regulatory Enforcement Fairness 
Act of 1996.\11\
---------------------------------------------------------------------------

    \9\ 5 U.S.C. 553(b)(A).
    \10\ 5 U.S.C. 601 through 612.
    \11\ 5 U.S.C. 804(3)(c).
---------------------------------------------------------------------------

    The effective date for the updated Filer Manual and related rule 
amendments is April 19, 2024. In accordance with the APA,\12\ we find 
that there is good cause to establish an effective date less than 30 
days after publication of these rules. The Commission believes that 
establishing an effective date less than 30 days after publication of 
these rules is necessary to coordinate the effectiveness of the updated 
Filer Manual with the related system upgrades.
---------------------------------------------------------------------------

    \12\ 5 U.S.C. 553(d)(3).
---------------------------------------------------------------------------

V. Statutory Basis

    We are adopting the amendments to Regulation S-T under the 
authority in Sections 6, 7, 8, 10, and 19(a) of the Securities Act of 
1933,\13\ Sections 3, 12, 13, 14, 15, 15B, 23, and 35A of the 
Securities Exchange Act of 1934,\14\ Section 319 of the Trust Indenture 
Act of 1939,\15\ and Sections 8, 30, 31, and 38 of the Investment 
Company Act of 1940.\16\
---------------------------------------------------------------------------

    \13\ 15 U.S.C. 77f, 77g, 77h, 77j, and 77s(a).
    \14\ 15 U.S.C. 78c, 78l, 78m, 78n, 78o, 78o-4, 78w, and 78ll.
    \15\ 15 U.S.C. 77sss.
    \16\ 15 U.S.C. 80a-8, 80a-29, 80a-30, and 80a-37.

    Filers must prepare electronic filings in the manner prescribed by 
the EDGAR Filer Manual, promulgated by the Commission, which sets forth 
the technical formatting requirements for electronic submissions. The 
requirements for becoming an EDGAR Filer and updating company data are 
set forth in the EDGAR Filer Manual, Volume I: ``General Information,'' 
Version 41 (December 2022). The requirements for filing on EDGAR are 
set forth in the updated EDGAR Filer Manual, Volume II: ``EDGAR 
Filing,'' Version 69 (March 2024). All of these provisions have been 
incorporated by reference into the Code of Federal Regulations, which 
action was approved by the Director of the Federal Register in 
accordance with 5 U.S.C. 552(a) and 1 CFR part 51. You must comply with 
these requirements in order for documents to be timely received and 
accepted. The EDGAR Filer Manual is available for inspection at the 
Commission and at the National Archives and Records Administration 
(NARA). The EDGAR Filer Manual is available for website viewing and 
printing in the Commission's Public Reference Room, 100 F Street NE,
