SECURITIES AND EXCHANGE COMMISSION

[SEC File No. 270-658, OMB Control No. 3235-0716]


Submission for OMB Review; Comment Request; Extension: Form C

Upon Written Request Copies Available From: Securities and Exchange 
Commission, Office of FOIA Services, 100 F Street NE, Washington, DC 
20549-2736

    Notice is hereby given that, pursuant to the Paperwork Reduction 
Act of 1995 (44 U.S.C. 3501 et seq.), the Securities and Exchange 
Commission (``Commission'') has submitted to the Office of Management 
and Budget this request for extension of the previously approved 
collection of information discussed below.
    Form C (17 CFR 239.900) is used by issuers offering securities in 
reliance on the crowdfunding exemption in Section 4(a)(6) (15 U.S.C. 
77d(a)(6)) of the Securities Act of 1933 (``Securities Act'') (15 
U.S.C. 77a et seq.) Form C will also be used by issuers that have 
completed transactions in reliance on Section 4(a)(6) to file annual 
reports or to provide notice of the termination of reporting 
obligations. The information collected is intended to create a 
framework for the filing and disclosure requirements of Title III 
Section 4A of the Jumpstart Our Business Startups Act (Pub. L. 112-106, 
126 Stat. 306) to implement the exemption from Securities Act 
registration for offerings made in reliance on Section 4(a)(6). Form C 
takes approximately 61.3957 hours per response and is filed by 
approximately 3,476 respondents. We estimate that 75% of the 61.3957 
hours per response (46.0468 hours per response) is prepared by the 
issuer for a total annual reporting burden of 160,059 hours (46.0468 
hours per response x 3,476 responses).
    An agency may not conduct or sponsor, and a person is not required 
to respond to, a collection of information unless it displays a 
currently valid control number.
    The public may view background documentation for this information 
collection at the following website: <a href="http://www.reginfo.gov">www.reginfo.gov</a>. Find this 
particular information collection by selecting

Secretary.
