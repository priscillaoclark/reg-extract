SECURITIES AND EXCHANGE COMMISSION

[SEC File No. 270-418, OMB Control No. 3235-0485]


Submission for OMB Review; Comment Request; Extension: Rule 15c2-
1

Upon Written Request, Copies Available From: Securities and Exchange 
Commission, Office of FOIA Services, 100 F Street NE, Washington, DC 
20549-2736

    Notice is hereby given that pursuant to the Paperwork Reduction Act 
of 1995 (``PRA'') (44 U.S.C. 3501 et seq.), the Securities and Exchange 
Commission (``Commission'') has submitted to the Office of Management 
and Budget (``OMB'') a request for approval of extension of the 
previously approved collection of information provided for in Rule 
15c2-1, (17 CFR 240.15c2-1), under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 
(15 U.S.C. 78a et seq.).
    Rule 15c2-1 prohibits broker-dealers from commingling under the 
same lien securities of their margin customers with securities of the 
broker-dealer and those of other customers without their written 
consent. The rule also prohibits the re-hypothecation of customers' 
margin securities for a sum in excess of the customer's aggregate 
indebtedness. Respondents must collect information necessary to prevent 
the re-hypothecation of customer securities, issue and retain copies of 
notices of hypothecation of customer securities, and collect written 
consents from customers.
    There are approximately 59 respondents. Each of these respondents 
makes an estimated 45 responses per year and each response takes 
approximately 0.5 hours to complete, resulting in an industry-wide 
annual burden of approximately 1,327 hours.
    The retention period for the recordkeeping requirement under Rule 
15c2-1 is not less than two years following the date the notice is 
submitted. The recordkeeping requirement under this rule is mandatory 
to assist the Commission in monitoring respondents who fail to collect 
the information required under the rule. This rule does not involve the 
collection of confidential information.
    An agency may not conduct or sponsor, and a person is not required 
to respond to, a collection of information under the PRA unless it 
displays a currently valid OMB control number.
    The public may view background documentation for this information 
collection at the following website: <a href="http://www.reginfo.gov">www.reginfo.gov</a>. Find this 
particular information collection by selecting ``Currently under 30-day 
Review--Open for Public Comments'' or by using the search function. 
Written comments and recommendations for the proposed information 
collection should be sent by January 22, 2024 to
    (i) <a href="http://www.reginfo.gov/public/do/PRAMain">www.reginfo.gov/public/do/PRAMain</a> and (ii) David Bottom, 
Director/Chief Information Officer, Securities and Exchange Commission, 
c/o John Pezzullo, 100 F Street NE, Washington, DC 20549, or by sending

     Dated: December 18, 2023.
Sherry R. Haywood,
Assistant Secretary.
