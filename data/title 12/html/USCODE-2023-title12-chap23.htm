<!-- field-end:head -->
<!-- field-start:statute -->
<p class="statutory-body">(a) It is declared to be the policy of the Congress, recognizing that a prosperous, productive agriculture is essential to a free nation and recognizing the growing need for credit in rural areas, that the farmer-owned cooperative Farm Credit System be designed to accomplish the objective of improving the income and well-being of American farmers and ranchers by furnishing sound, adequate, and constructive credit and closely related services to them, their cooperatives, and to selected farm-related businesses necessary for efficient farm operations.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(b) It is the objective of this chapter to continue to encourage farmer- and rancher-borrowers participation in the management, control, and ownership of a permanent system of credit for agriculture which will be responsive to the credit needs of all types of agricultural producers having a basis for credit, and to modernize and improve the authorizations and means for furnishing such credit and credit for housing in rural areas made available through the institutions constituting the Farm Credit System as herein provided.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(c) It is declared to be the policy of Congress that the credit needs of farmers, ranchers, and their cooperatives are best served if the institutions of the Farm Credit System provide equitable and competitive interest rates to eligible borrowers, taking into consideration the creditworthiness and access to alternative sources of credit for borrowers, the cost of funds, the operating costs of the institution, including the costs of any loan loss amortization under section 2254(b)<sup><a href="#2001_1_target" name="2001_1">1</a></sup> of this title, the cost of servicing loans, the need to retain earnings to protect borrowers&apos; stock, and the volume of net new borrowing. Further, it is declared to be the policy of Congress that Farm Credit System institutions take action in accordance with the Farm Credit Act Amendments of 1986 in such manner that borrowers from the institutions derive the greatest benefit practicable from that Act: <i>Provided</i>, That in no case is any borrower to be charged a rate of interest that is below competitive market rates for similar loans made by private lenders to borrowers of equivalent creditworthiness and access to alternative credit.</p>

<h3 class="section-head">&sect;2132. Earnings and reserves; application of savings</h3>
<!-- field-end:head -->
<!-- field-start:statute -->
<h4 class="subsection-head">(a) Application of savings</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">At the end of each fiscal year, the net savings shall, under regulations prescribed by the Farm <!-- PDFPage:1320 -->Credit Administration, continue to be applied on a cooperative basis with provision for sound, adequate capitalization to meet the changing financing needs of eligible cooperative borrowers and prudent corporate fiscal management, to the end that current year's patrons carry their fair share of the capitalization, ultimate expenses, and reserves related to the year's operations and the remaining net savings shall be distributed as patronage refunds as provided in subsection (b). Such regulations may provide for application of net savings to the restoration or maintenance of an allocated surplus account, reasonable additions to unallocated surplus, or to unallocated reserves after payment of operating expenses, and provide for allocations to patrons not qualified under title 26, or payment of such per centum of patronage refunds in cash, as the board may determine.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(b) Patronage refunds</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">The net savings of each bank for cooperatives, after the earnings for the fiscal year have been applied in accordance with subsection (a) of this section shall be paid in stock, participation certificates, or cash, or in any of them, as determined by its board, as patronage refunds to borrowers to whom such refunds are payable who are borrowers of the fiscal year for which such patronage refunds are distributed. All patronage refunds shall be paid in proportion that the amount of interest and service fees on the loans to each borrower during the year bears to the interest and service fees on the loans of all borrowers during the year or on such other proportionate patronage basis as may be approved by the board of directors.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(c) Loss carryover</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">In the event of a net loss in any fiscal year after providing for all operating expenses (including reasonable valuation reserves and losses in excess of any applicable reserves), such loss may be carried forward or carried back, if appropriate, or otherwise shall be absorbed by charges to unallocated reserve or surplus accounts established after December 10, 1971; charges to allocated contingency reserve account; charges to allocated surplus accounts; charges to other contingency reserve and surplus accounts; the impairment of voting stock; or the impairment of all other stock.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(d) Charge of unrecognized costs or expenses to reserve, surplus, or patronage allocations</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">Notwithstanding any other provisions of this section any costs or expenses attributable to a prior year or years but not recognized in determining the net savings for such year or years may be charged to reserves or surplus of the bank or to patronage allocations for such years, as may be determined by the board of directors.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(e) Payment of patronage refunds in cash</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">A bank for cooperatives may pay in cash such portion of its patronage refunds as will permit its taxable income to be determined without taking into account savings applied as allocated surplus, allocated contingency reserves, and patronage refunds under subsection (a) of this section.</p>

<!-- field-end:head -->
<!-- field-start:statute -->
<h4 class="subsection-head">(a) Minimum levels of capital</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">The Farm Credit Administration shall cause System institutions to achieve and maintain adequate capital by establishing minimum levels of capital for such System institutions and by using such other methods as the Farm Credit Administration deems appropriate. The Farm Credit Administration may establish such minimum level of capital for a System institution as the Farm Credit Administration, in its discretion, deems to be necessary or appropriate in light of the particular circumstances of the System institution.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(b) Failure to maintain minimum levels; directives; plans for achieving minimum levels; proposals affecting compliance</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">(1) Failure of a System institution to maintain capital at or above its minimum level as established under subsection (a) may be deemed by the Farm Credit Administration, in its discretion, to constitute an unsafe and unsound practice within the meaning of this chapter.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(2) In addition to, or in lieu of, any other action authorized by law, including paragraph (1), the Farm Credit Administration may issue a directive to a System institution that fails to maintain capital at or above its required level as established under subsection (a). Such directive may require the System institution to submit and adhere to a plan acceptable to the Farm Credit Administration describing the means and timing by which the System institution shall achieve its required capital level, but may not require merger or consolidation without a majority vote of the voting stockholders or the contributors to the guaranty fund of the institution.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(3) The Farm Credit Administration may consider such System institution's progress in adhering to any plan required under paragraph (2) whenever such System institution, or an affiliate thereof, seeks the requisite approval of the Farm Credit Administration for any proposal that would divert earnings, diminish capital, or otherwise impede such System institution's progress in achieving its minimum capital level. The Farm Credit Administration may deny such approval where it determines that such proposal would adversely affect the ability of the System institution to comply with such plan.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(c) Enhancement of capital adequacy of banks</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">Each bank shall have on hand at the time of issuance of any note, bond, debenture, or other similar obligation and at all times thereafter maintain, free from any lien or other pledge, notes and other obligations representing loans made under this chapter or real or personal property acquired in connection with loans made under this chapter, obligations of the United States or any agency thereof direct or fully guaranteed, other bank assets (including marketable securities) approved by the Farm Credit Administration, or cash, in an aggregate value equal to the total amount of notes, bonds, debentures, or other similar obligations outstanding for which the bank is primarily liable.</p>

<p class="statutory-body-2em">(B) allocated and unallocated earnings (which, in the case of earnings allocated in any form by a System bank to any association or other recipient and retained by the bank, shall be considered, in whole or in part, permanent capital of the bank or of any such association or other recipient as provided under an agreement between the bank and each such association or other recipient);</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(C) all surplus (less allowances for losses);</p>

<h4 class="paragraph-head">(2) Effective date</h4>

<h4 class="subsection-head">(d) Reduction of capital</h4>
<h4 class="paragraph-head">(1) General rule</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">Except as provided in paragraph (2), the board of directors of a System institution may not reduce the permanent capital of the institution through the payment of patronage refunds or dividends, or the retirement of stock if, after or due to such action, the permanent capital of the institution would thereafter fail to meet the minimum capital adequacy standards established under section 2154(a) of this title.</p>
<h4 class="paragraph-head">(2) Exceptions</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">Paragraph (1) shall not apply to the payment of noncash patronage refunds by any institution exempt from Federal income tax if the entire refund paid qualifies as permanent capital. Notwithstanding paragraph (1), any System institution subject to Federal income tax may pay patronage refunds partially in cash as long as the cash portion of the refund is the minimum amount required to qualify the refund as a deductible patronage distribution for Federal income tax purposes and the remaining portion of the refund paid qualifies as permanent capital.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(e) Compliance</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">The Farm Credit Administration may issue a directive that requires compliance with subsection (d), to the board of directors of any System institution that fails to comply therewith.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(f) Loans designated for sale or sold into secondary market</h4>
<h4 class="paragraph-head">(1) In general</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">Subject to paragraph (2) and notwithstanding any other provision of this section, the bylaws adopted by a bank or association under subsection (b) may provide&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(A) in the case of a loan made on or after February 10, 1996, that is designated, at the time the loan is made, for sale into a secondary market, that no voting stock or participation certificate purchase requirement shall apply to the borrower for the loan; and</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(B) in the case of a loan made before February 10, 1996, that is sold into a secondary market, that all outstanding voting stock or participation certificates held by the borrower with respect to the loan shall, subject to subsection (d)(1), be retired.</p>
<h4 class="paragraph-head">(2) Applicability</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">Notwithstanding any other provision of this section, in the case of a loan sold to a secondary market under subchapter VIII, paragraph (1) shall apply regardless of whether the bank or association retains a subordinated participation interest in a loan or pool of loans or contributes to a cash reserve.</p>
<h4 class="paragraph-head">(3) Exception</h4>
<h4 class="subparagraph-head">(A) In general</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">Subject to subparagraph (B) and notwithstanding any other provision of this section, <!-- PDFPage:1327 -->if a loan designated for sale under paragraph (1)(A) is not sold into a secondary market during the 180-day period that begins on the date of the designation, the voting stock or participation certificate purchase requirement that would otherwise apply to the loan in the absence of a bylaw provision described in paragraph (1)(A) shall be effective.</p>
<h4 class="subparagraph-head">(B) Retirement</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">The bylaws adopted by a bank or association under subsection (b) may provide that if a loan described in subparagraph (A) is sold into a secondary market after the end of the 180-day period described in the subparagraph, all outstanding voting stock or participation certificates held by the borrower with respect to the loan shall, subject to subsection (d)(1), be retired.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(g) Construction</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">This section shall not be construed to affect the provisions of this chapter that confer on System institutions a lien on borrower stock or other equities and the privilege to retire or cancel such stock or other equities for application against the indebtedness on a defaulted or restructured loan.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(h) Controlling authority</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">To the extent that any provision of this section is inconsistent with any other provision of this chapter (other than section 2162 of this title), the provision of this section shall control.</p>

<p class="statutory-body">(B) Such calls first shall be made on all nondefaulting banks in proportion to each such bank's proportionate share of the aggregate available collateral held by all such banks.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(C) For purposes of this paragraph, the term &quot;available collateral&quot; means the amount (determined at the close of the last calendar quarter ending before such call) by which a bank's collateral as described in section 2154 of this title exceeds the collateral required to support the bank's outstanding notes, bonds, debentures, and other similar obligations.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(D) If the Farm Credit Administration makes any such call and the available collateral of all such banks does not fully satisfy the liability necessitating such calls, such calls shall be made on all nondefaulting banks in proportion to each such bank's remaining assets.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(E) Any System bank that, pursuant to a call by the Farm Credit Administration, makes a payment of principal or interest to the holder of any consolidated or System-wide obligation issued on behalf of another System bank shall be subrogated to all rights of the holder against such other bank to the extent of such payment.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(F) On making such a call with respect to obligations issued on behalf of a System bank, the Farm Credit Administration shall appoint a re<!-- PDFPage:1328 -->ceiver for the bank, which shall expeditiously liquidate or otherwise wind up the affairs of the bank.</p>

<h4 class="subsection-head">(a) Voluntary liquidation; consent of Farm Credit Administration; rules and regulations; minimization of adverse effect; voluntary merger; mandatory merger on failure to comply or meet obligations</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">No institution of the System shall go into voluntary liquidation without the consent of the Farm Credit Administration and with such consent may liquidate only in accordance with regulations prescribed by the Farm Credit Administration. In the case of a voluntary liquidation of an association, such regulations, among other things, shall direct the supervising bank to institute such measures as it deems appropriate to minimize the adverse effect of the liquidation on those borrowers whose loans are purchased by or otherwise transferred to another System institution. The Farm Credit Administration Board <!-- PDFPage:1332 -->may require an association to merge with another association whenever it determines, with the concurrence of the board of the supervising bank, that an association has failed to meet its outstanding obligations or failed to conduct its operations in accordance with this chapter.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(b) Appointment of conservator or receiver; grounds; action for removal; stay of actions or proceedings</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">The Farm Credit Administration Board may appoint a conservator or receiver for any System institution on the determination by the Farm Credit Administration Board that one or more of the following exists, or is occurring, with respect to the institution: (1) insolvency, in that the assets of the institution are less than its obligations to its creditors and others, including its members; (2) substantial dissipation of assets or earnings due to any violation of law, rules, or regulations, or to any unsafe or unsound practice; (3) an unsafe or unsound condition to transact business; (4) willful violation of a cease and desist order that has become final; (5) concealment of books, papers, records, or assets of the institution or refusal to submit books, papers, records, or other material relating to the affairs of the institution for inspection to any examiner or to any lawful agent of the Farm Credit Administration; (6) the institution is unable to timely pay principal or interest on any insured obligation (as defined in section 2277a(3) of this title) issued by the institution. The Farm Credit Administration Board shall have exclusive power and jurisdiction to appoint a conservator or receiver, and such receiver or conservator, after the 5-year period beginning on January 6, 1988, shall be the Farm Credit System Insurance Corporation. If the Farm Credit Administration Board determines that a ground for the appointment of a conservator or receiver as herein provided exists, the Farm Credit Administration Board may appoint ex parte and without notice a conservator or receiver for the institution. In the event of such appointment, the institution, within thirty days thereafter, may bring an action in the United States district court for the judicial district in which the home office of such institution is located, or in the United States District Court for the District of Columbia, for an order requiring the Farm Credit Administration Board to remove such conservator or receiver, and the court shall on the merits, dismiss such action or direct the Farm Credit Administration Board to remove such conservator or receiver. On the commencement of such an action, the court having jurisdiction of any other action or enforcement proceeding authorized under this chapter to which the institution is a party shall stay such action or proceeding during the pendency of the action for removal of the conservator or receiver.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(c) Involuntary liquidation; rules and regulations; minimization of adverse effect</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">In the case of an involuntary liquidation of an association, regulations of the Farm Credit Administration, among other things, shall direct the supervising bank to institute such measures as it deems appropriate to minimize the adverse effect of the liquidation on those borrowers whose loans are purchased by or otherwise transferred to another System institution.</p>

<h4 class="subsection-head">(j) Application of section</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">The time limitation prescribed in subsection (b)(2), and the requirements of subsection (c), shall not apply to a loan that became a distressed loan before January 6, 1988, if the borrower and lender of the loan are in the process of negotiating loan restructuring with respect to the loan.</p>

<p class="note-body">Pub. L. 99&ndash;198, title XIII, &sect;1326, Dec. 23, 1985, 99 Stat. 1540, provided that:</p>
<p class="note-body">&quot;(a) Congress finds and declares that&mdash;</p>
<p class="note-body-1em">&quot;(1) high production costs and low commodity prices have combined to reduce farm income to the lowest levels since the depths of the Depression in the 1930's, to subject many agricultural producers, through no fault of their own, to severe economic hardship, and in many cases temporarily but seriously to impair producers&apos; ability to meet loan repayment schedules in a timely fashion; and</p>
<!-- PDFPage:1362 --><p class="note-body-1em">&quot;(2) a policy of adverse classification of agricultural loans by bank examiners under these circumstances will trigger a wave of foreclosures and similar actions on the part of banks, thereby depressing land values and prices for agricultural facilities and equipment and having a devastating effect on farmers and the banking industry, and upon rural areas of the United States in general.</p>
<p class="note-body">&quot;(b) It is therefore the sense of Congress that the Federal bank regulatory agencies should ensure, in their examination procedures, that examiners exercise caution and restraint and give due consideration not only to the current cash flow of agricultural borrowers under financial stress, but to factors such as their loan collateral and ultimate ability to repay as well, for so long as the adverse economic effects of the cost-price squeeze of recent years continue to impair the ability of these borrowers to meet scheduled repayments on their loans.&quot;</p>

<p class="statutory-body">(a) If, in the opinion of the Farm Credit Administration, any institution in the Farm Credit System, or any director, officer, employee, agent, or other person participating in the conduct of the affairs of such an institution is engaging or has engaged, or the Farm Credit Administration has reasonable cause to believe that the institution or any director, officer, employee, agent, or other person participating in the conduct of the affairs of such institution is about to engage, in an unsafe or unsound practice in conducting the business of such institution, or is violating or has violated, or the Farm Credit Administration has reasonable cause to believe that the institution or any director, officer, employee, agent, or other person participating in the conduct of the affairs of such institution is about to violate, a law, rule, or regulation, or any condition imposed in writing by the Farm Credit Administration in connection with the granting of any application or other request by the institution or any written agreement entered into with the Farm Credit Administration, the Farm Credit Administration may issue and serve upon the institution or such director, officer, employee, agent, or other person a notice of charges in respect thereof. The notice shall contain a statement of the facts constituting the alleged violation or violations or the unsafe or unsound practice or practices, and shall fix a time and place at which a hearing will be held to determine whether an order to cease and desist therefrom should issue against the institution or the director, officer, employee, agent, or other person participating in the conduct of the affairs of such institution. Such hearing shall be fixed for a date not earlier than thirty days nor later than sixty days after service of such notice unless an earlier or a later date is set by the Farm Credit Administration at the request of any party so served. Unless the party or parties so served shall appear at the hearing personally or by a duly authorized representative, they shall be deemed to have consented to the issuance of the cease and desist order. In the event of such consent, or if upon the record made at any such hearing, the Farm Credit Administration shall find that any violation or unsafe or unsound practice specified in the notice of charges has been established, the Farm Credit Administration may issue and serve upon the institution or the director, officer, employee, agent, or other person participating in the conduct of the affairs of such institution an order to cease and desist from any such violation or practice. Such order may, by provisions that may be mandatory or otherwise, require the institution or its directors, officers, employees, agents, and other persons participating in the conduct of the affairs of such institution to cease and desist from the same, and, further, to take affirmative action to correct the conditions resulting from any such violation or practice.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(b) A cease and desist order shall become effective at the expiration of thirty days after the service of such order upon the institution or other person concerned (except in the case of a cease and desist order issued upon consent, which shall become effective at the time specified therein), and shall remain effective and enforceable as provided therein except to such extent as it is stayed, modified, terminated, or set aside by action of the Farm Credit Administration or a reviewing court.</p>

Such order shall become effective upon service upon the institution or such director, officer, employee, agent, or other person participating in the conduct of the affairs of such institution and, unless set aside, limited, or suspended by a court in proceedings authorized by subsection (b), shall remain effective and enforceable pending the completion of the administrative proceedings pursuant to such notice and until such time as the Farm Credit Administration shall dismiss the charges specified in such notice, or if a cease and desist order is issued against the institution or such director, officer, employee, agent, or other person, until effective date of such order.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(b) Within ten days after the institution concerned or any director, officer, employee, agent, or other person participating in the conduct of the affairs of such institution has been served with a temporary cease and desist order, the institution or such director, officer, employee, agent, or other person may apply to the United States district court for the judicial district in which the home office of the institution is located, or the United States district court for the District of Columbia, for an injunction setting aside, limiting, or suspending the enforcement, operation, or effectiveness of such order pending the completion of the administrative proceedings pursuant to the notice of charges served upon the institution or such director, officer, employee, agent, or other person under section 2261 of this title, and such court shall have jurisdiction to issue such injunction.</p>

<h3 class="section-head">&sect;2265. Suspension or removal of director or officer charged with felony</h3>
<!-- field-end:head -->
<!-- field-start:statute -->
<p class="statutory-body">(a) Whenever any director or officer of an institution in the Farm Credit System, or other person participating in the conduct of the affairs of such institution, is charged in any information, indictment, or complaint authorized by a United States attorney, with the commission of or participation in a crime involving dishonesty or breach of trust that is punishable by imprisonment for a term exceeding one year under State or Federal law, the Farm Credit Administration may, if continued service or participation by the individual may pose a threat to the interests of the institution's shareholders or investors in Farm Credit System obligations or threaten to impair public confidence in the institution or the Farm Credit System, by written notice served upon such director, officer, or other person, suspend such director, officer, or other person from office or prohibit such director, officer, or other person from further participation in any manner in the conduct of the affairs of the institution. A copy of such notice shall also be served upon the institution. Such suspension or prohibition shall remain in effect until such information, indictment, or complaint is finally disposed of or until terminated by the Farm Credit Administration. In the event that a judgment of conviction with respect to such crime is entered against such director, officer, or other person, and at such time as such judgment is not subject to further appellate review, the Farm Credit Administration may, if continued service or participation by the individual may pose a threat to the interests of the institution's shareholders or the investors in Farm Credit System obligations or may threaten to impair public confidence in the institution or the Farm Credit System, issue and serve upon such director, officer, or other person an order removing such director, officer, or other person from office or prohibiting such director, officer, or other person from further participation in any manner in the conduct of the affairs of the institution except with the consent of the Farm Credit Administration. A copy of such order shall also be served upon such institution, whereupon such director or officer shall cease to be a director or officer of such institution. A finding of not guilty or other disposition of the charge shall not preclude the Farm Credit Administration from thereafter instituting proceedings to remove such director, officer, or other person from office or to prohibit further participation in Farm Credit System affairs under section 2264 of this title. Any notice of suspension or order of removal issued under this paragraph shall remain effective and outstanding until the completion of any hearing or appeal authorized under subsection (b) unless terminated by the Farm Credit Administration.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(b) Within thirty days from service of any notice of suspension or order of removal issued under subsection (a), the director, officer, or other person concerned may request in writing an opportunity to appear before the Farm Credit Administration to show that the continued service to or participation in the conduct of the affairs of the institution by such individual does not, or is not likely to, pose a threat to the interest of the institution's shareholders or the investors in Farm Credit System obligations or threaten to impair public confidence in the institution or the Farm Credit System. Upon receipt of any such request, the Farm Credit Administration shall fix a time (not more than thirty days after receipt of such request, unless extended at the request of the concerned director, officer, or other person) and place at which the director, officer, or other person may appear, personally or through counsel, before the Chairman of the Farm Credit Administration or designated employees of the Farm Credit Administration to submit written materials (or, at the discretion of the Farm Credit Administration, oral testimony) and oral argument. Within sixty days of such hearing, the Farm Credit Administration shall notify the director, officer, or other person whether the suspension or prohibition from participation in any manner in the conduct of the affairs of the institution will be continued, terminated, or otherwise modified, or whether the order removing such director, officer, or other person from office or prohibiting such individual from further participation in any manner in the conduct of the affairs of the institution will be rescinded or otherwise modified. Such notification shall contain a statement of the basis for the Farm Credit Administration's decision, if adverse to the director, officer, or other person. The Farm Credit Administration may prescribe such rules as may be necessary to effectuate the purposes of this subsection.</p>

Such hearing shall be private, unless the Farm Credit Administration, in its discretion, after fully considering the views of the party afforded the hearing, determines that a public hearing is necessary to protect the public interest. After such hearing, and within ninety days after the Farm Credit Administration has notified the parties that the case has been submitted to it for final decision, it shall render its decision (which shall include findings of fact upon which its decision is predicated) and shall issue and serve upon each party to the proceeding an order or orders consistent with the provisions of this part. Judicial review of any such order shall be exclusively as provided in this section. Unless a petition for review is timely filed in a court of appeals of the United States, as hereinafter provided in subsection (b), and thereafter until the record in the proceeding has been filed as so provided, the Farm Credit Administration may at any time, upon such notice and in such manner as it shall deem proper, modify, terminate, or set aside any such order. Upon such filing of the record, the Farm Credit Administration may modify, terminate, or set aside any such order with permission of the court.</p>

A copy of such petition shall be forthwith transmitted by the clerk of the court to the Farm Credit Administration, and thereupon the Farm Credit Administration shall file in the court the record in the proceeding, as provided in section 2112 of title 28. Upon the filing of such petition, such court shall have jurisdiction, which upon the filing of the record shall except as provided in the last sentence of subsection (a) be exclusive, to affirm, modify, terminate, or set aside, in whole or in part, the order of the Farm Credit Administration. Review of such proceedings shall be had as provided in chapter 7 of title 5. The judgment and decree of the court shall be final, except that the same shall be subject to review by the Supreme Court upon certiorari, as provided in section 1254 of title 28.</p>

<p class="statutory-body">Any institution in the System that violates or any officer, director, employee, agent, or other person participating in the conduct of the affairs of such an institution who violates the terms of any order that has become final and was issued under section 2261 or 2262 of this title, shall forfeit and pay a civil penalty of not more than $1,000 per day for each day during which such violation continues. Any such institution or person who violates any provision of this chapter or any regulation issued under this chapter shall forfeit and pay a civil penalty of not more than $500 per day for each day during which such violation continues.

In determining the amount of the penalty, the Farm Credit Administration shall take into account the appropriateness of the penalty with respect to the size of financial resources and good faith of the System institution or person charged, the gravity of the violation, the history of previous violations, and such other matters as justice may require.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(c) Notice and hearing; final orders</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">The System institution or person assessed shall be afforded an opportunity for a hearing by the Farm Credit Administration, upon request made within ten days after issuance of the notice of assessment.

If no hearing is requested as herein provided, the assessment shall constitute a final and unappealable order.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(d) Judicial review</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">Any System institution or person against whom an order imposing a civil money penalty has been entered after a Farm Credit Administration hearing under this section may obtain review by the United States court of appeals for the circuit in which the home office of the System institution is located, or the United States Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia Circuit, by filing a notice of appeal in such court within twenty days after the service of such order, and simultaneously sending a copy of such notice by registered or certified mail to the Farm Credit Administration. The Farm Credit Administration shall promptly certify and file in such Court the record upon which the penalty was imposed, as provided in section 2112 of title 28. Final orders of the Farm Credit Administration issued under subsection (c) shall be reviewable under chapter 7 of title 5.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(e) Action by Attorney General to recover amount assessed</h4>

<p class="statutory-body-1em">(2) all loans or investments made by any bank, company, institution, corporation, union, or association described in section 2015(b)(1)(B) of this title, that is able to make such loans or investments because such entity is receiving, or has received, funds provided through the insured System bank; and</p>

<h3 class="section-head">&sect;2279bb&ndash;1. Risk-based capital levels</h3>
<!-- field-end:head -->
<!-- field-start:statute -->
<h4 class="subsection-head">(a) Risk-based capital test</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">The Director of the Office of Secondary Market Oversight shall, by regulation, establish a risk-based capital test under this section for the Corporation. When applied to the Corporation, the risk-based capital test shall determine the amount of regulatory capital for the Corporation that is sufficient for the Corporation to maintain positive capital during a 10-year period in which both of the following circumstances occur:</p>
<h4 class="paragraph-head">(1) Credit risk</h4>
<h4 class="subparagraph-head">(A) In general</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">With respect to securities representing an interest in, or obligations backed by, a pool of qualified loans owned or guaranteed by the Corporation and other obligations of the Corporation, losses on the underlying qualified loans occur throughout the United States at a rate of default and severity (based on any measurements of default reasonably related to prevailing industry practice in determining capital adequacy) reasonably related to the rate and severity that occurred in contiguous areas of the United States containing an aggregate of not less than 5 percent of the total population of the United States that, for a period of not less than 2 years (as established by the Director), experienced the highest rates of default and severity of agricultural mortgage losses, in <!-- PDFPage:1429 -->comparison with such rates of default and severity of agricultural mortgage losses in other such areas for any period of such duration, as determined by the Director.</p>
<h4 class="subparagraph-head">(B) Rural utility loans</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">With respect to securities representing an interest in, or obligation backed by, a pool of qualified loans described in section 2279aa(7)(C) of this title owned or guaranteed by the Corporation, losses occur at a rate of default and severity reasonably related to risks in electric and telephone facility loans (as applicable), as determined by the Director.</p>
<h4 class="paragraph-head">(2) Interest rate risk</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">Interest rates on Treasury obligations of varying terms increase or decrease over the first 12 months of such 10-year period by not more than the lesser of (A) 50 percent (with respect to the average interest rates on such obligations during the 12-month period preceding the 10-year period), or (B) 600 basis points, and remain at such level for the remainder of the period. This paragraph may not be construed to require the Director to determine interest rate risk under this paragraph based on the interest rates for various long-term and short-term obligations all increasing or all decreasing concurrently.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(b) Considerations</h4>
<h4 class="paragraph-head">(1) Establishment of test</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">In establishing the risk-based capital test under subsection (a)&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(A) the Director shall take into account appropriate distinctions based on various types of agricultural mortgage products, varying terms of Treasury obligations, and any other factors the Director considers appropriate;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(B) the Director shall conform loan data used in determining credit risk to the minimum geographic and commodity diversification standards applicable to pools of qualified loans eligible for guarantee;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(C) the Director may take into account retained subordinated participating interests under section 2279aa&ndash;6(b)(2) of this title (as in effect before February 10, 1996);</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(D) the Director may take into account other methods or tests to determine credit risk developed by the Corporation before December 13, 1991; and</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(E) the Director shall consider any other information submitted by the Corporation in writing during the 180-day period beginning on December 13, 1991.</p>
<h4 class="paragraph-head">(2) Revising test</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">Upon the expiration of the 8-year period beginning on December 13, 1991, the Director shall examine the risk-based capital test under subsection (a) and may revise the test. In making examinations and revisions under this paragraph, the Director shall take into account that, before December 13, 1991, the Corporation has not issued guarantees for pools of qualified loans. To the extent that the revision of the risk-based capital test causes a change in the classification of the Corporation within the enforcement levels established under section 2279bb&ndash;4 of this title, the Director shall waive the applicability of any additional enforcement actions available because of such change for a reasonable period of time, to permit the Corporation to increase the amount of regulatory capital of the Corporation accordingly.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(c) Risk-based capital level</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">For purposes of this part, the risk-based capital level for the Corporation shall be equal to the sum of the following amounts:</p>
<h4 class="paragraph-head">(1) Credit and interest rate risk</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">The amount of regulatory capital determined by applying the risk-based capital test under subsection (a) to the Corporation, adjusted to account for foreign exchange risk.</p>
<h4 class="paragraph-head">(2) Management and operations risk</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">To provide for management and operations risk, 30 percent of the amount of regulatory capital determined by applying the risk-based capital test under subsection (a) to the Corporation.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(d) Specified contents</h4>
<h4 class="paragraph-head">(1) In general</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">The regulations establishing the risk-based capital test under this section shall&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(A) be issued by the Director for public comment in the form of a notice of proposed rulemaking, to be first published after the expiration of the period referred to in subsection (a); and</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(B) contain specific requirements, definitions, methods, variables, and parameters used under the risk-based capital test and in implementing the test (such as loan loss severity, float income, loan-to-value ratios, taxes, yield curve slopes, default experience, prepayment rates, and performance of pools of qualified loans).</p>
<h4 class="paragraph-head">(2) Specificity</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">The regulations referred to in paragraph (1) shall be sufficiently specific to permit an individual other than the Director to apply the test in the same manner as the Director.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(e) Availability of model</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">The Director shall make copies of the statistical model or models used to implement the risk-based capital test under this section available for public acquisition and may charge a reasonable fee for such copies.</p>
