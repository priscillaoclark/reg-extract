<h4 class="subsection-head">(a) Bond not required; agents; fee</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">The Corporation as receiver of an insured depository institution or branch of a foreign bank shall not be required to furnish bond and may appoint an agent or agents to assist it in its duties as such receiver. All fees, compensation, and expenses of liquidation and administration shall be fixed by the Corporation, and may be paid by it out of funds coming into its possession as such receiver.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(b) Payment of insured deposit as discharge from liability</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">Payment of an insured deposit to any person by the Corporation shall discharge the Corporation, and payment of a transferred deposit to any person by the new depository institution or by an insured depository institution in which a transferred deposit has been made available shall discharge the Corporation and such new depository institution or other insured depository institution, to the same extent that payment to such person by the depository institution in default would have discharged it from liability for the insured deposit.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(c) Recognition of claimant not on depository institution records</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">Except as otherwise prescribed by the Board of Directors, neither the Corporation nor such new depository institution or other insured depository institution shall be required to recognize as the owner of any portion of a deposit appearing <!-- PDFPage:1084 -->on the records of the depository institution in default under a name other than that of the claimant, any person whose name or interest as such owner is not disclosed on the records of such depository institution in default as part owner of said deposit, if such recognition would increase the aggregate amount of the insured deposits in such depository institution in default.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(d) Withholding payments to meet liability to depository institution</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">The Corporation may withhold payment of such portion of the insured deposit of any depositor in a depository institution in default as may be required to provide for the payment of any liability of such depositor to the depository institution in default or its receiver, which is not offset against a claim due from such depository institution, pending the determination and payment of such liability by such depositor or any other person liable therefor.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(e) Disposition of unclaimed deposits</h4>
<h4 class="paragraph-head">(1) Notices</h4>
<h4 class="subparagraph-head">(A) First notice</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">Within 30 days after the initiation of the payment of insured deposits under section 1821(f) of this title, the Corporation shall provide written notice to all insured depositors that they must claim their deposit from the Corporation, or if the deposit has been transferred to another institution, from the transferee institution.</p>
<h4 class="subparagraph-head">(B) Second notice</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">A second notice containing this information shall be mailed by the Corporation to all insured depositors who have not responded to the first notice, 15 months after the Corporation initiates such payment of insured depositors.</p>

<p class="statutory-body-2em">(A) any transferee institution shall refund the deposit to the Corporation, and all rights of the depositor against the transferee institution shall be barred; and</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(B) with the exception of United States deposits, the Corporation shall deliver the deposit to the custody of the appropriate State as unclaimed property, unless the appropriate State declines to accept custody. Upon delivery to the appropriate State, all rights of the depositor against the Corporation with respect to the deposit shall be barred and the Corporation shall be deemed to have made payment to the depositor for purposes of section 1821(g)(1) of this title.</p>
<h4 class="paragraph-head">(3) Refusal of appropriate State to accept custody</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">If the appropriate State declines to accept custody of the deposit tendered pursuant to paragraph (2)(B), the deposit shall not be delivered to any State, and the insured depositor shall claim the deposit from the Corporation before the receivership is terminated, or all rights of the depositor with respect to such deposit shall be barred.</p>
<h4 class="paragraph-head">(4) Treatment of United States deposits</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">If the deposit is a United States deposit it shall be delivered to the Secretary of the Treasury for deposit in the general fund of the Treasury. Upon delivery to the Secretary of the Treasury, all rights of the depositor against the Corporation with respect to the deposit shall be barred and the Corporation shall be deemed to have made payment to the depositor for purposes of section 1821(g)(1) of this title.</p>
<h4 class="paragraph-head">(5) Reversion</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">If a depositor does not claim the deposit delivered to the custody of the appropriate State pursuant to paragraph (2)(B) within 10 years of the date of delivery, the deposit shall be immediately refunded to the Corporation and become its property. All rights of the depositor against the appropriate State with respect to such deposit shall be barred as of the date of the refund to the Corporation.</p>
