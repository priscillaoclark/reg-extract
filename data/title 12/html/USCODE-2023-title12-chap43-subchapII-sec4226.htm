<p class="note-body">Section 4221 of this title, referred to in subsec. (c)(1), was in the original &quot;section 831&quot;, and was translated as <!-- PDFPage:1625 -->reading &quot;section 2576&quot;, meaning section 2576 of Pub. L. 101&ndash;647, as the probable intent of Congress, because Pub. L. 101&ndash;647 does not contain a section 831.</p>
