<h4 class="subsection-head">(a) U.S. nonbank financial companies supervised by the Board of Governors</h4>
<h4 class="paragraph-head">(1) Determination</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">The Council, on a nondelegable basis and by a vote of not fewer than 2/3 of the voting members then serving, including an affirmative vote by the Chairperson, may determine that a U.S. nonbank financial company shall be supervised by the Board of Governors and shall be subject to prudential standards, in accordance with this subchapter, if the Council determines that material financial distress at the U.S. nonbank financial company, or the nature, scope, size, scale, concentration, interconnectedness, or mix of the activities of the U.S. nonbank financial company, could pose a threat to the financial stability of the United States.</p>
<h4 class="paragraph-head">(2) Considerations</h4>

<p class="statutory-body-2em">(G) the nature, scope, size, scale, concentration, interconnectedness, and mix of the activities of the company;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(H) the degree to which the company is already regulated by 1 or more primary financial regulatory agencies;</p>

<p class="statutory-body-2em">(A) material financial distress related to, or the nature, scope, size, scale, concentration, interconnectedness, or mix of, the financial activities conducted directly or indirectly by a company incorporated or organized under the laws of the United States or any State or the financial activities in the United States of a company incorporated or organized in a country other than the United States would pose a threat to the financial stability of the United States, based on consideration of the factors in subsection (a)(2) or (b)(2), as applicable;</p>

<h4 class="paragraph-head">(3) Consolidated supervision of only financial activities; establishment of an intermediate holding company</h4>
<h4 class="subparagraph-head">(A) Establishment of an intermediate holding company</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">Upon a determination under paragraph (1), the company that is the subject of the determination may establish an intermediate holding company in which the financial activities of such company and its subsidiaries shall be conducted (other than the activities described in section 5367(b)(2) of this title) in compliance with any regulations or guidance provided by the Board of Governors. Such intermediate holding company shall be subject to the supervision of the Board of Governors and to prudential standards under this subchapter as if the intermediate holding com<!-- PDFPage:1841 -->pany were a nonbank financial company supervised by the Board of Governors.</p>
<h4 class="subparagraph-head">(B) Action of the Board of Governors</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">To facilitate the supervision of the financial activities subject to the determination in paragraph (1), the Board of Governors may require a company to establish an intermediate holding company, as provided for in section 5367 of this title, which would be subject to the supervision of the Board of Governors and to prudential standards under this subchapter, as if the intermediate holding company were a nonbank financial company supervised by the Board of Governors.</p>
<h4 class="paragraph-head">(4) Notice and opportunity for hearing and final determination; judicial review</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">Subsections (d) through (h) shall apply to determinations made by the Council pursuant to paragraph (1) in the same manner as such subsections apply to nonbank financial companies.</p>
<h4 class="paragraph-head">(5) Covered financial activities</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">For purposes of this subsection, the term &quot;financial activities&quot;&mdash;</p>

For purposes of this Act, the financial activities that are the subject of the determination in paragraph (1) shall be subject to the same requirements as a nonbank financial company supervised by the Board of Governors. Nothing in this paragraph shall prohibit or limit the authority of the Board of Governors to apply prudential standards under this subchapter to the financial activities that are subject to the determination in paragraph (1).</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(d) Reevaluation and rescission</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">The Council shall&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(1) not less frequently than annually, reevaluate each determination made under subsections (a) and (b) with respect to such nonbank financial company supervised by the Board of Governors; and</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(2) rescind any such determination, if the Council, by a vote of not fewer than 2/3 of the voting members then serving, including an affirmative vote by the Chairperson, determines that the nonbank financial company no longer meets the standards under subsection (a) or (b), as applicable.</p>

<h4 class="paragraph-head">(1) In general</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">The Council shall provide to a nonbank financial company written notice of a proposed determination of the Council, including an explanation of the basis of the proposed determination of the Council, that a nonbank financial company shall be supervised by the Board of Governors and shall be subject to prudential standards in accordance with this subchapter.</p>
<h4 class="paragraph-head">(2) Hearing</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">Not later than 30 days after the date of receipt of any notice of a proposed determination under paragraph (1), the nonbank financial company may request, in writing, an opportunity for a written or oral hearing before the Council to contest the proposed determination. Upon receipt of a timely request, the Council shall fix a time (not later than 30 days after the date of receipt of the request) and place at which such company may appear, personally or through counsel, to submit written materials (or, at the sole discretion of the Council, oral testimony and oral argument).</p>
<h4 class="paragraph-head">(3) Final determination</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">Not later than 60 days after the date of a hearing under paragraph (2), the Council shall notify the nonbank financial company of the final determination of the Council, which shall contain a statement of the basis for the decision of the Council.</p>
