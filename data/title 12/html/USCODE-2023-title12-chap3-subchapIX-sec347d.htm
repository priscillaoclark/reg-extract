In exercising any such powers with respect to any such branch or agency, each Federal Reserve bank shall give due regard to account balances being maintained by such branch or agency with such Reserve bank and the proportion of the assets of such branch or agency being held as reserves under section 3105 of this title. For the purposes of this paragraph, the terms &quot;branch&quot;, &quot;agency&quot;, and &quot;foreign bank&quot; shall have the same meanings assigned to them in section 3101 of this title.</p>
