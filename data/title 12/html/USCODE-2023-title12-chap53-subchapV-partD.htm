<h4 class="paragraph-head">(2) Bureau considerations required for issuance of final regulation</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">Before prescribing a final regulation based upon a notice issued pursuant to paragraph (1), the Bureau shall take into account whether&mdash;</p>

<p class="statutory-body-2em">(B) the intended benefits of the proposed regulation for consumers would outweigh any increased costs or inconveniences for consumers, and would not discriminate unfairly against any category or class of consumers; and</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(C) a Federal banking agency has advised that the proposed regulation is likely to present an unacceptable safety and soundness risk to insured depository institutions.</p>

<h4 class="paragraph-head">(4) Reservation of authority</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">No provision of this subsection shall be construed as limiting or restricting the authority of the Bureau to enhance consumer protection standards established pursuant to this title&#160;<sup><a href="#5551_1_target" name="5551_1">1</a></sup> in response to its own motion or in response to a request by any other interested person.</p>

<p class="statutory-body-1em">No provision of this subsection shall be construed as exempting the Bureau from complying with subchapter II of chapter 5 of title 5.</p>
<h4 class="paragraph-head">(6) Definition</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">For purposes of this subsection, the term &quot;consumer protection regulation&quot; means a regulation that the Bureau is authorized to prescribe under the Federal consumer financial laws.</p>
