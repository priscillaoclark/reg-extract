<h4 class="subsection-head">(c) Establishment of revised minimum capital levels</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">Notwithstanding subsections (a) and (b) and notwithstanding the capital classifications of the regulated entities, the Director may, by regulations issued under section 4526 of this title, establish a minimum capital level for the enterprises, for the Federal Home Loan Banks, or for both the enterprises and the banks, that is higher than the level specified in subsection (a) for the enterprises or the level specified in subsection (b) for the Federal Home Loan Banks, to the extent needed to ensure that the regulated entities operate in a safe and sound manner.</p>

<h4 class="paragraph-head">(1) In general</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">Notwithstanding subsections (a) and (b) and any minimum capital level established pursuant to subsection (c), the Director may, by order, increase the minimum capital level for a regulated entity on a temporary basis, when the Director determines that such an increase is necessary and consistent with the prudential regulation and the safe and sound operations of a regulated entity.</p>
<h4 class="paragraph-head">(2) Rescission</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">The Director shall rescind any temporary minimum capital level established under paragraph (1) when the Director determines that the circumstances or facts no longer justify the temporary minimum capital level.</p>

<h4 class="subsection-head">(e) Authority to establish additional capital and reserve requirements for particular purposes</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">The Director may, at any time by order or regulation, establish such capital or reserve requirements with respect to any product or activity of a regulated entity, as the Director considers appropriate to ensure that the regulated entity operates in a safe and sound manner, with sufficient capital and reserves to support the risks that arise in the operations and management of the regulated entity.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(f) Periodic review</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">The Director shall periodically review the amount of core capital maintained by the enterprises, the amount of capital retained by the Federal Home Loan Banks, and the minimum capital levels established for such regulated entities pursuant to this section.</p>
