<h4 class="paragraph-head">(1) Member directorships</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">Each member directorship shall be designated by the Director as representing the members located in a particular State, and shall be filled by a person who is an officer or director of a member located in that State, each of which members shall be entitled to <!-- PDFPage:291 -->nominate an eligible person for such directorship, and such office shall be filled from such nominees by a plurality of the votes which such members may cast in an election held for the purpose of filling such office, in which election each such member may cast for such office a number of votes equal to the number of shares of stock in such bank required by this chapter to be held by such member at the end of the calendar year next preceding the election, as determined pursuant to regulation of the Director, but not in excess of the average number of shares of stock in such bank required by this chapter to be held at the end of such calendar year by the respective members of such bank located in such State, as so determined. No person who is an officer or director of a member that fails to meet any applicable capital requirement is eligible to hold the office of Federal Home Loan Bank director. As used in this subsection and in subsection (c) of this section, the term &quot;member&quot; means a member of a Federal home loan bank which was a member of such bank at the end of such calendar year.</p>

<h4 class="subsection-head">(c) Apportionment among States in bank district; designation of State location</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">The number of member directorships designated as representing the members located in each separate State in a bank district shall be determined by the Director in the approximate ratio of the percentage of the required stock, as determined pursuant to regulation of the Director, of the members located in that State at the end of the calendar year next preceding the date of the election to the total required stock, as so determined, of all members of such bank at the end of such year, except that in the case of each State such number shall not be less than one and shall not be more than six. Notwithstanding any other provision of this section, (A) except as provided in clause (B) of this sentence, if at any time the number of member directorships so designated as representing the members located in any State would not be at least equal to the total number of elective directorships which, on December 31, 1960, were filled by officers or directors of members whose principal places of business were located in such State, the Director shall add to the board of directors of the bank of the district in which such State is located such number of member directorships, and shall so designate the directorship or directorships thus added, that the number of member directorships designated as representing the members located in such State will equal said total number, and (B) clause (A) of this sentence shall not apply to the directorships of any Federal Home Loan Bank resulting from the merger of any 2 or more such Banks. Any member directorship so added shall exist only until the expiration of its first term. The Director shall, with respect to each member of a Federal home loan bank, designate the State in the district of such bank in which such member shall, for the purposes of this subsection and subsection (b) of this section, be deemed to be located, and may from time to time change any such designation, but if the principal place of business of any such member is located in a State of such district it shall be the duty of the Director to designate such State as the State in which such member shall, for said purposes, be deemed to be located. As used in the second sentence of this subsection, the term &quot;total number of elective directorships&quot; means the total number of elective directorships on the board of directors of the bank of the district in which such State was located on December 31, 1960, and the term &quot;members&quot; where used for the second time in such sentence means members of such bank.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(d) Terms; rules and regulations governing nominations and elections</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">The term of each director shall be 4 years.

If any person, before or after, or partly before and partly after, September 8, 1961, has been elected to each of three consecutive full terms as a director of a Federal home loan bank and has served for all or part of each of said terms, such person shall not be eligible for election to a directorship of such bank for a term which begins earlier than two years after the expiration of the last expiring of said three terms. The Director is authorized to prescribe such rules and regulations as it may deem necessary or appropriate for the nomination and election of directors of Federal home loan banks, including, without limitation on the generality of the foregoing, rules and regulations with respect to the breaking of ties and with respect to the inclusion of more than one directorship on a single ballot and the methods of voting and of determining the results of voting in such cases.</p>

The Director in its&#160;<sup><a href="#1427_1_target" name="1427_1">1</a></sup> discretion may shorten the next succeeding term of any such elective directorship to one year, and may fill such term by appointment.
