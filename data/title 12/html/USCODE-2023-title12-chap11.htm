<h4 class="paragraph-head">(1) Member directorships</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">Each member directorship shall be designated by the Director as representing the members located in a particular State, and shall be filled by a person who is an officer or director of a member located in that State, each of which members shall be entitled to <!-- PDFPage:291 -->nominate an eligible person for such directorship, and such office shall be filled from such nominees by a plurality of the votes which such members may cast in an election held for the purpose of filling such office, in which election each such member may cast for such office a number of votes equal to the number of shares of stock in such bank required by this chapter to be held by such member at the end of the calendar year next preceding the election, as determined pursuant to regulation of the Director, but not in excess of the average number of shares of stock in such bank required by this chapter to be held at the end of such calendar year by the respective members of such bank located in such State, as so determined.

Notwithstanding any other provision of this section, (A) except as provided in clause (B) of this sentence, if at any time the number of member directorships so designated as representing the members located in any State would not be at least equal to the total number of elective directorships which, on December 31, 1960, were filled by officers or directors of members whose principal places of business were located in such State, the Director shall add to the board of directors of the bank of the district in which such State is located such number of member directorships, and shall so designate the directorship or directorships thus added, that the number of member directorships designated as representing the members located in such State will equal said total number, and (B) clause (A) of this sentence shall not apply to the directorships of any Federal Home Loan Bank resulting from the merger of any 2 or more such Banks. Any member directorship so added shall exist only until the expiration of its first term. The Director shall, with respect to each member of a Federal home loan bank, designate the State in the district of such bank in which such member shall, for the purposes of this subsection and subsection (b) of this section, be deemed to be located, and may from time to time change any such designation, but if the principal place of business of any such member is located in a State of such district it shall be the duty of the Director to designate such State as the State in which such member shall, for said purposes, be deemed to be located.

If any person, before or after, or partly before and partly after, September 8, 1961, has been elected to each of three consecutive full terms as a director of a Federal home loan bank and has served for all or part of each of said terms, such person shall not be eligible for election to a directorship of such bank for a term which begins earlier than two years after the expiration of the last expiring of said three terms. The Director is authorized to prescribe such rules and regulations as it may deem necessary or appropriate for the nomination and election of directors of Federal home loan banks, including, without limitation on the generality of the foregoing, rules and regulations with respect to the breaking of ties and with respect to the inclusion of more than one directorship on a single ballot and the methods of voting and of determining the results of voting in such cases.</p>

The Director in its&#160;<sup><a href="#1427_1_target" name="1427_1">1</a></sup> discretion may shorten the next succeeding term of any such elective directorship to one year, and may fill such term by appointment. The term &quot;States&quot; or &quot;State&quot; as used in this section shall mean the States of the Union, the District of Columbia, and the Commonwealth of Puerto Rico. The Director, by regulation or otherwise, may add an additional elective directorship to the board of directors of the bank of any district in which the Commonwealth of Puerto Rico is included at the time such directorship is added and which does not then include five or more States, may fix the commencement and the duration, which shall not exceed two years, of the initial term of any directorship so added, and may fill any such initial term by appointment: <i>Provided</i>, That (1) any directorship added pursuant to the foregoing provisions of this sentence shall be designated by the Director, pursuant to subsection (b) of this section, as representing the members located in the Commonwealth of Puerto Rico, (2) such designation of such directorship shall not be changed, and (3) such directorship shall automatically cease to exist if and when the Commonwealth of Puerto Rico ceases to be included in such district.</p>

<!-- field-end:head -->
<!-- field-start:statute -->
<h4 class="subsection-head">(a) In general</h4>
<h4 class="paragraph-head">(1) All advances</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">Each Federal Home Loan Bank is authorized to make secured advances to its members upon collateral sufficient, in the judgment of the Bank, to fully secure advances obtained from the Bank under this section or section 1431(g) of this title.</p>
<h4 class="paragraph-head">(2) Purposes of advances</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">A long-term advance may only be made for the purposes of&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(A) providing funds to any member for residential housing finance; and</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(B) providing funds to any community financial institution for small businesses, small farms, small agri-businesses, and community development activities.</p>
<h4 class="paragraph-head">(3) Collateral</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">A Bank, at the time of origination or renewal of a loan or advance, shall obtain and maintain a security interest in collateral eligible pursuant to one or more of the following categories:</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(A) Fully disbursed, whole first mortgages on improved residential property (not more than 90 days delinquent), or securities representing a whole interest in such mortgages.</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(B) Securities issued, insured, or guaranteed by the United States Government or any agency thereof (including without limitation, mortgage-backed securities issued or guaranteed by the Federal Home Loan Mortgage Corporation, the Federal National Mortgage Corporation, and the Government National Mortgage Association).</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(C) Cash or deposits of a Federal Home Loan Bank.</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(D) Other real estate related collateral acceptable to the Bank if such collateral has a readily ascertainable value and the Bank can perfect its interest in the collateral.</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(E) Secured loans for small business, agriculture, or community development activities or securities representing a whole interest in such secured loans, in the case of any community financial institution.</p>
<h4 class="paragraph-head">(4) Additional bank authority</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">Subparagraphs (A) through (E) of paragraph (3) shall not affect the ability of any Federal <!-- PDFPage:296 -->Home Loan Bank to take such steps as it deems necessary to protect its security position with respect to outstanding advances, including requiring deposits of additional collateral security, whether or not such additional security would be eligible to originate an advance. If an advance existing on August 9, 1989, matures and the member does not have sufficient eligible collateral to fully secure a renewal of such advance, a Bank may renew such advance secured by such collateral as the Bank determines is appropriate. A member that has an advance secured by such insufficient eligible collateral must reduce its level of outstanding advances promptly and prudently in accordance with a schedule determined by the Federal home loan bank.</p>
<h4 class="paragraph-head">(5) Review of certain collateral standards</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">The Director may review the collateral standards applicable to each Federal home loan bank for the classes of collateral described in subparagraphs (D) and (E) of paragraph (3), and may, if necessary for safety and soundness purposes, require an increase in the collateral standards for any or all of those classes of collateral.</p>
<h4 class="paragraph-head">(6) Definitions</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">For purposes of this subsection, the terms &quot;small business&quot;, &quot;agriculture&quot;, &quot;small farm&quot;, &quot;small agri-business&quot;, and &quot;community development activities&quot; shall have the meanings given those terms by regulation of the Director.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(b) Appraisals and other investigations; acceptance of home mortgages as collateral security only by approval of Director</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">For the purposes of this section, each Home Loan Bank shall have power to make, or to cause or require to be made, such appraisals and other investigations as it may deem necessary. No home mortgage otherwise eligible to be accepted as collateral security for an advance by a Home Loan Bank shall be accepted if any director, officer, employee, attorney or agent of the Home Loan Bank or of the borrowing institution is personally liable thereon, unless the Director has specifically approved such acceptance.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(c) Notes of borrowing members; interest rate; lien on stock</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">Such advances shall be made upon the note or obligation of the member secured as provided in this section, bearing such rate of interest as the Federal home loan bank may approve or determine, and the Federal Home Loan Bank shall have a lien upon and shall hold the stock of such member as further collateral security for all indebtedness of the member to the Federal Home Loan Bank.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(d) Obligation to repay; additional security; sale of advances to other banks</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">The institution applying for an advance shall enter into a primary and unconditional obligation to pay off all advances, together with interest and any unpaid costs and expenses in connection therewith according to the terms under which they were made, in such form as shall meet the requirements of the bank. The bank shall reserve the right to require at any time, when deemed necessary for its protection, deposits of additional collateral security or substitutions of security by the borrowing institution, and each borrowing institution shall assign additional or substituted security when and as so required. Any Federal Home Loan Bank shall have power to sell to any other Federal Home Loan Bank, with or without recourse, any advance made under the provisions of this chapter, or to allow to such bank a participation therein, and any other Federal Home Loan Bank shall have power to purchase such advance or to accept a participation therein, together with an appropriate assignment of security therefor.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(e) Priority of certain secured interests</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">Notwithstanding any other provision of law, any security interest granted to a Federal Home Loan Bank by any member of any Federal Home Loan Bank or any affiliate of any such member shall be entitled to priority over the claims and rights of any party (including any receiver, conservator, trustee, or similar party having rights of a lien creditor) other than claims and rights that&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(1) would be entitled to priority under otherwise applicable law; and</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(2) are held by actual bona fide purchasers for value or by actual secured parties that are secured by actual perfected security interests.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(g)&#160;<sup><a href="#1430_1_target" name="1430_1">1</a></sup> Community support requirements</h4>
<h4 class="paragraph-head">(1) In general</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">Before the end of the 2-year period beginning on August 9, 1989, the Director shall adopt regulations establishing standards of community investment or service for members of Banks to maintain continued access to long-term advances.</p>
<h4 class="paragraph-head">(2) Factors to be included</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">The regulations promulgated pursuant to paragraph (1) shall take into account factors such as a member's performance under the Community Reinvestment Act of 1977 [12 U.S.C. 2901 et seq.] and the member's record of lending to first-time homebuyers.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(h) Special liquidity advances</h4>
<h4 class="paragraph-head">(1) In general</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">Subject to paragraph (2), the Federal Home Loan Banks may, upon the request of the Director of the Office of Thrift Supervision, make short-term liquidity advances to a savings association that&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(A) is solvent but presents a supervisory concern because of such association's poor financial condition; and</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(B) has reasonable and demonstrable prospects of returning to a satisfactory financial condition.</p>
<h4 class="paragraph-head">(2) Interest on and security for special liquidity advances</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">Any loan by a Federal Home Loan Bank pursuant to paragraph (1) shall be subject to all applicable collateral requirements, including the requirements of subsection (a), and shall be at an interest rate no less favorable than those made available for similar short-term li<!-- PDFPage:297 -->quidity advances to savings associations that do not present such supervisory concern.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(i) Community investment program</h4>
<h4 class="paragraph-head">(1) In general</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">Each Bank shall establish a program to provide funding for members to undertake community-oriented mortgage lending. Each Bank shall designate a community investment officer to implement community lending and affordable housing advance programs of the Banks under this subsection and subsection (j) and provide technical assistance and outreach to promote such programs. Advances under this program shall be priced at the cost of consolidated Federal Home Loan Bank obligations of comparable maturities, taking into account reasonable administrative costs.</p>

<h4 class="paragraph-head">(2) Standards</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">The Board's&#160;<sup><a href="#1430_2_target" name="1430_2">2</a></sup> regulations shall permit Bank members to use subsidized advances received from the Banks to&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(A) finance homeownership by families with incomes at or below 80 percent of the median income for the area;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(B) finance the purchase, construction, or rehabilitation of rental housing, at least 20 percent of the units of which will be occupied by and affordable for very low-income households for the remaining useful life of such housing or the mortgage term; or</p>

<h4 class="paragraph-head">(3) Priorities for making advances</h4>

<h4 class="subparagraph-head">(B) Financial instability</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">In determining the financial instability of a Bank, the Director shall consider such factors as (i) whether the Bank's earnings are severely depressed, (ii) whether there has been a substantial decline in membership capital, and (iii) whether there has been a substantial reduction in advances outstanding.</p>

<p class="statutory-body-2em">The Director shall notify the Committee on Banking, Finance and Urban Affairs of the House of Representatives and the Committee on Banking, Housing, and Urban Affairs of the Senate not less than 60 days before such suspension takes effect.

<h4 class="subsection-head">(a) Borrowing money; issuing bonds and debentures; general powers</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">Each Federal Home Loan Bank shall have power, subject to rules and regulations prescribed by the Director, to borrow and give security therefor and to pay interest thereon, to issue debentures, bonds, or other obligations upon such terms and conditions as the Director may approve, and to do all things necessary for carrying out the provisions of this chapter and all things incident thereto.</p>

<p class="statutory-body">The Office of Finance, as agent for the Banks, may issue consolidated Federal Home Loan Bank debentures which shall be the joint and several obligations of all Federal Home Loan Banks organized and existing under this chapter, in order to provide funds for any such bank or banks, and such debentures shall be issued upon such terms and conditions as such Office may prescribe. No such debentures shall be issued at any time if any of the assets of any Federal Home Loan Bank are pledged to secure any debts or subject to any lien, and neither the Office of Finance nor any Federal Home Loan Bank shall have power to pledge any of the assets of any Federal Home Loan Bank, or voluntarily to permit any lien to attach to the same while any of such debentures so issued are outstanding. The debentures issued under this section and outstanding shall at no time exceed five times the total paid-in capital of all the Federal Home Loan Banks as of the time of the issue of such debentures. It shall be the duty of the Office of Finance not to issue debentures under this section in excess of the notes or obligations of member institutions held and secured under section 1430(a) of this title by all the Federal Home Loan Banks.</p>

<p class="statutory-body">(2)(A) The Director may, subject to such rules and regulations, including definitions of terms <!-- PDFPage:303 -->used in this paragraph, as the Director shall from time to time prescribe, authorize Federal Home Loan Banks to be drawees of, and to engage in, or be agents or intermediaries for, or otherwise participate or assist in, the collection and settlement of (including presentment, clearing, and payment of, and remitting for), checks, drafts, or any other negotiable or nonnegotiable items or instruments of payment drawn on or issued by members of any Federal Home Loan Bank or by institutions which are eligible to make application to become members pursuant to section 1424 of this title, and to have such incidental powers as the Director shall find necessary for the exercise of any such authorization.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(B) A Federal Home Loan Bank shall make charges, to be determined and regulated by the Director consistent with the principles set forth in section 248a(c) of this title, or utilize the services of, or act as agent for, or be a member of, a Federal Reserve bank, clearinghouse, or any other public or private financial institution or other agency, in the exercise of any powers or functions pursuant to this paragraph.</p>

In prescribing such rules and regulations, the Director may adopt or apply, in whole or in part, general banking usage and practices, and, in instances or respects in which they would otherwise not be applicable, Federal Reserve regulations and operating letters, the Uniform Commercial Code, and clearinghouse rules.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(f) Rediscount of notes held by other banks; purchase of bonds of other banks</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">The Director is authorized and empowered to permit or to require Federal Home Loan Banks, upon such terms and conditions as the Director may prescribe, to rediscount the discounted notes of members held by other Federal Home Loan Banks, or to make loans to, or make deposits with, such other Federal Home Loan Banks, or to purchase any bonds or debentures issued under this section.</p>

<h4 class="subsection-head">(h) Investment of surplus funds</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">Such part of the assets of each Federal Home Loan Bank (except reserves and amounts provided for in subsection (g)) as are not required for advances to members, may be invested, to such extent as the bank may deem desirable and subject to such regulations, restrictions, and limitations as may be prescribed by the Director, in obligations of the United States, in obligations, participations, or other instruments of or issued by the Federal National Mortgage Association or the Government National Mortgage Association, in mortgages, obligations, or other securities which are or ever have been sold by the Federal Home Loan Mortgage Corporation pursuant to section 1454 or section 1455 of this title, in the stock of the Federal National Mortgage Association, in stock, obligations, or other securities of any small business investment company formed pursuant to section 681 of title 15, for the purpose of aiding members of the Federal Home Loan Bank System, and in such securities as fiduciary and trust funds may be invested in under the laws of the State in which the Federal Home Loan Bank is located.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(i) Treasury purchase of banks&apos; obligations; exercise of authority</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">The Secretary of the Treasury is authorized in his discretion to purchase any obligations issued pursuant to this section, as heretofore, now, or hereafter in force and for such purpose the Secretary of the Treasury is authorized to use as a public-debt transaction the proceeds of the sale of any securities hereafter issued under chapter 31 of title 31, as now or hereafter in force, and the purposes for which securities may be issued under chapter 31 of title 31, as now or hereafter in force, are extended to include such purchases. The Secretary of the Treasury may, at any time, sell, upon such terms and conditions and at such price or prices as he shall determine, any of the obligations acquired by him under this subsection. All redemptions, purchases, and sales by the Secretary of the Treasury of such obligations under this subsection shall be treated as public-debt transactions of the United States. The Secretary of the Treasury shall not at any time purchase any obligations under this paragraph if such purchase would increase the aggregate principal amount of his then outstanding holdings of such obligations under this paragraph to an amount greater than $4,000,000,000. Each purchase of obligations by the Secretary of the Treasury under this subsection shall be upon terms and conditions as shall be determined by the Secretary of the Treasury and shall bear such rate of interest as may be determined by the Secretary of the Treasury taking into consideration the current average market yield for the month preceding the month of such purchase on outstanding marketable obligations of the United States.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">In addition to obligations authorized to be purchased by the preceding paragraph, the Secretary of the Treasury is authorized to purchase any obligations issued pursuant to this section <!-- PDFPage:304 -->in amounts not to exceed $2,000,000,000. The authority provided in this paragraph shall expire August 10, 1975.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">Notwithstanding the foregoing, the authority provided in this subsection may be exercised during any calendar quarter beginning after October 28, 1974, only if the Secretary of the Treasury and the Chairperson of the Director&#160;<sup><a href="#1431_1_target" name="1431_1">1</a></sup> certify to the Congress that (1) alternative means cannot be effectively employed to permit members of the Federal Home Loan Bank System to continue to supply reasonable amounts of funds to the mortgage market, and (2) the ability to supply such funds is substantially impaired because of monetary stringency and a high level of interest rates. Any funds borrowed under this subsection shall be repaid by the Home Loan Banks at the earliest practicable date.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(j) Audits</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">Notwithstanding the provisions of section 9105(a)(1)(B)&#160;<sup><a href="#1431_2_target" name="1431_2">2</a></sup> of title 31, audits by the Government Accountability Office of the financial transactions of a Federal Home Loan Bank shall not be limited to periods during which Government capital has been invested therein.
