<h3 class="section-head">&sect;203. Appointment of conservator</h3>
<!-- field-end:head -->
<!-- field-start:statute -->
<h4 class="subsection-head">(a) Appointment</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">The Comptroller of the Currency may, without prior notice or hearings, appoint a conservator (which may be the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation) to the possession and control of a bank whenever the Comptroller of the Currency determines that 1 or more of the grounds specified in section 11(c)(5) of the Federal Deposit Insurance Act [12 U.S.C. 1821(c)(5)] exist.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(b) Judicial review</h4>
<h4 class="paragraph-head">(1) In general</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">Not later than 20 days after the initial appointment of a conservator pursuant to this section, the bank may bring an action in the United States district court for the judicial district in which the home office of such bank is located, or in the United States District Court for the District of Columbia, for an order requiring the Comptroller to terminate <!-- PDFPage:69 -->the appointment of the conservator, and the court, upon the merits, shall dismiss such action or shall direct the Comptroller to terminate the appointment of such conservator. The Comptroller's decision to appoint a conservator pursuant to this section shall be set aside only if the court finds that such decision was arbitrary, capricious, an abuse of discretion, or otherwise not in accordance with law.</p>
<h4 class="paragraph-head">(2) Stay</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">The conservator may request that any judicial action or proceeding to which the conservator or the bank is or may become a party be stayed for a period of up to 45 days after the appointment of the conservator. Upon petition, the court shall grant such stay as to all parties.</p>
<h4 class="paragraph-head">(3) Actions and orders</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">Except as otherwise provided in this subsection, no court may take any action regarding the removal of a conservator, or restrain, or affect the exercise of powers or functions of a conservator. A court, upon application by the Comptroller, shall have jurisdiction to enforce an order of the Comptroller relating to&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(A) the conservatorship and the bank in conservatorship, or</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(B) restraining or affecting the exercise of powers or functions of a conservator.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(c) Additional grounds for appointment</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">In addition to the foregoing provisions, the Comptroller may appoint a conservator for a bank if&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(1) the bank, by an affirmative vote of a majority of its board of directors or by an affirmative vote of a majority of its shareholders, consents to such appointment, or</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(2) the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation terminates the bank's status as an insured bank.</p>
<br class="Q04" />
<p class="statutory-body-block">The appointment of a conservator pursuant to this subsection shall not be subject to review.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(d) Exclusive authority</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">The Comptroller shall have exclusive power and jurisdiction to appoint a conservator for a bank. Whenever the Comptroller appoints a conservator for any bank, the Comptroller may appoint the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation conservator for such bank. The Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation, as such conservator, shall have all the powers granted under the Federal Deposit Insurance Act [12 U.S.C. 1811 et seq.], and (when not inconsistent therewith) any other rights, powers, and privileges possessed by conservators of banks under this Act and any other provision of law. The Comptroller may also appoint another person as conservator, who shall be subject to the provisions of this Act.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(e) Replacement of conservator</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">The Comptroller may, without notice or hearing, replace a conservator with another conservator. Such replacement shall not affect the bank's right under subsection (b) to obtain judicial review of the Comptroller's original decision to appoint a conservator.</p>

<h4 class="subsection-head">(a) General rule</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">At any time the Comptroller&#160;<sup><a href="#205_1_target" name="205_1">1</a></sup> becomes satisfied that it may safely be done and that it would be in the public interest, the Comptroller (with the agreement of the Board of Directors of the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation when the Corporation has been appointed conservator) may&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(1) terminate the conservatorship and permit the involved bank to resume the transaction of its business subject to such terms, conditions, and limitations as the Comptroller may prescribe; or</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(2) terminate the conservatorship upon a sale, merger, consolidation, purchase and assumption, change in control, or voluntary dissolution and liquidation of the involved bank.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(b) Other grounds for termination</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">The Comptroller also may terminate the conservatorship upon the appointment of a receiver pursuant to section 191 of this title.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(c) Enforcement under Federal Deposit Insurance Act</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">Such terms, conditions, and limitations as may be prescribed under subsection (a)(1) shall be enforceable under the provisions of section 8(i) of the Federal Deposit Insurance Act [12 U.S.C. 1818(i)], to the same extent as an order issued pursuant to section 8(b) of the Federal Deposit Insurance Act [12 U.S.C. 1818(b)] which has become final. The bank may bring an action in the United States district court for the judicial district in which the home office of such bank is located or in the United States District Court for the District of Columbia for an order requiring the Comptroller to terminate the order. An action for judicial review of the terms, conditions, and limitations may not be commenced later than 20 days from the date of the termination of the conservatorship or the imposition of the order, whichever is later.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(d) Action upon termination</h4>
<h4 class="paragraph-head">(1) In general</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">Upon termination of the conservatorship under subsection (a)(2), the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation, as conservator, or when another person is appointed conservator, such other person, shall conclude the affairs of the conservatorship in accordance with paragraph (2).</p>
<h4 class="paragraph-head">(2) Deposit and distribution of proceeds</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(A) Within 180 days of the sale, merger, consolidation, purchase and assumption, change in control, or voluntary dissolution and liquidation, the conservator shall deposit all net proceeds received from the transaction, less any outstanding expenses of the conservatorship, with the United States district court for the judicial district in which the home office of such bank is located and shall cause notice to be published for three consecutive months and notify by mail all known and remaining creditors and shareholders. Within 60 days thereafter, any depositor, creditor, or other claimant of the bank, or any shareholder of the bank may bring an action in interpleader in that court for distribution of the proceeds. The district court shall distribute such funds equitably. If no such action is instituted within one year after the date the funds are deposited with the district court, title to such net proceeds shall revert to the United States and the district court shall remit the funds to the Treasury of the United States.</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(B) The conservator shall be deemed to have discharged all responsibility of the conservatorship upon the deposit of the proceeds with the district court and giving the required notifications.</p>

<h4 class="subsection-head">(d) Compensation of conservator and employees</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">The conservator and professional employees appointed to represent or assist the conservator shall not be paid amounts greater than are payable to employees of the Federal Government for similar services, except that the Comptroller of the Currency may authorize payment at higher rates (but not in excess of rates prevailing in the private sector), if the Comptroller determines that paying such higher rates is necessary in order to recruit and retain competent personnel.</p>
