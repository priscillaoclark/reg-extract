<h4 class="subsection-head">(a) In general</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">The Bureau is authorized to exercise its authorities under Federal consumer financial law to administer, enforce, and otherwise implement the provisions of Federal consumer financial law.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(b) Rulemaking, orders, and guidance</h4>
<h4 class="paragraph-head">(1) General authority</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">The Director may prescribe rules and issue orders and guidance, as may be necessary or appropriate to enable the Bureau to administer and carry out the purposes and objectives of the Federal consumer financial laws, and to prevent evasions thereof.</p>
<h4 class="paragraph-head">(2) Standards for rulemaking</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">In prescribing a rule under the Federal consumer financial laws&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(A) the Bureau shall consider&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-3em">(i) the potential benefits and costs to consumers and covered persons, including the potential reduction of access by consumers to consumer financial products or services resulting from such rule; and</p>
<p class="statutory-body-3em">(ii) the impact of proposed rules on covered persons, as described in section 5516 of this title, and the impact on consumers in rural areas;</p>
<br class="Q04" />
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(B) the Bureau shall consult with the appropriate prudential regulators or other Federal agencies prior to proposing a rule and during the comment process regarding consistency with prudential, market, or systemic objectives administered by such agencies; and</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(C) if, during the consultation process described in subparagraph (B), a prudential regulator provides the Bureau with a written objection to the proposed rule of the Bureau or a portion thereof, the Bureau shall include in the adopting release a description of the objection and the basis for the Bureau decision, if any, regarding such objection, except that nothing in this clause shall be construed as altering or limiting the procedures under section 5513 of this title that may apply to any rule prescribed by the Bureau.</p>
<h4 class="paragraph-head">(3) Exemptions</h4>
<h4 class="subparagraph-head">(A) In general</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">The Bureau, by rule, may conditionally or unconditionally exempt any class of covered persons, service providers, or consumer financial products or services, from any provision of this title,<sup><a href="#5512_1_target" name="5512_1">1</a></sup> or from any rule issued under this title,<sup><a href="#5512_1_target" name="5512_1">1</a></sup> as the Bureau determines necessary or appropriate to carry out the purposes and objectives of this title,<sup><a href="#5512_1_target" name="5512_1">1</a></sup> taking into consideration the factors in subparagraph (B).</p>
<h4 class="subparagraph-head">(B) Factors</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">In issuing an exemption, as permitted under subparagraph (A), the Bureau shall, as appropriate, take into consideration&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-3em">(i) the total assets of the class of covered persons;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-3em">(ii) the volume of transactions involving consumer financial products or services in which the class of covered persons engages; and</p>

<h4 class="paragraph-head">(4) Exclusive rulemaking authority</h4>
<h4 class="subparagraph-head">(A) In general</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">Notwithstanding any other provisions of Federal law and except as provided in section 5581(b)(5) of this title, to the extent that a provision of Federal consumer financial law authorizes the Bureau and another Federal agency to issue regulations under that provision of law for purposes of assuring compliance with Federal consumer financial law and any regulations thereunder, the Bureau shall have the exclusive authority to prescribe rules subject to those provisions of law.</p>
<h4 class="subparagraph-head">(B) Deference</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">Notwithstanding any power granted to any Federal agency or to the Council under this title,<sup><a href="#5512_1_target" name="5512_1">1</a></sup> and subject to section 5581(b)(5)(E) of this title, the deference that a court affords to the Bureau with respect to a determination by the Bureau regarding the meaning or interpretation of any provision of a Federal consumer financial law shall be applied as if the Bureau were the only agency authorized <!-- PDFPage:1957 -->to apply, enforce, interpret, or administer the provisions of such Federal consumer financial law.</p>

<p class="statutory-body-2em">(D) rates of growth in the offering or provision of a consumer financial product or service;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(E) the extent, if any, to which the risks of a consumer financial product or service may disproportionately affect traditionally underserved consumers; or</p>
