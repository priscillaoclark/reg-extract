<p class="statutory-body">If, by the end of the 1-year period, or the 2-year period in the case of a State whose legislature meets only biennially, beginning on July 30, 2008, or at any time thereafter, the Director determines that a State does not have in place by law or regulation a system for licensing and registering loan originators that meets the requirements of sections 5104 and 5105 of this title and subsection (d) of this section, or does not participate in the Nationwide Mortgage Licensing System and Registry, the Director shall provide for the establishment and maintenance of a system for the licensing and registration by the Director of loan originators operating in such State as State-licensed loan originators.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(b) Licensing and registration requirements</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">The system established by the Director under subsection (a) for any State shall meet the requirements of sections 5104 and 5105 of this title for State-licensed loan originators.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(c) Unique identifier</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">The Director shall coordinate with the Nationwide Mortgage Licensing System and Registry to establish protocols for assigning a unique identifier to each loan originator licensed by the Director as a State-licensed loan originator that will facilitate electronic tracking and uniform identification of, and public access to, the employment history of and the publicly adjudicated disciplinary and enforcement actions against loan originators.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(d) State licensing law requirements</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">For purposes of this section, the law in effect in a State meets the requirements of this subsection if the Director determines the law satisfies the following minimum requirements:</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(1) A State loan originator supervisory authority is maintained to provide effective supervision and enforcement of such law, including the suspension, termination, or nonrenewal of a license for a violation of State or Federal law.</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(2) The State loan originator supervisory authority ensures that all State-licensed loan originators operating in the State are registered with Nationwide Mortgage Licensing System and Registry.</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(3) The State loan originator supervisory authority is required to regularly report violations of such law, as well as enforcement actions and other relevant information, to the Nationwide Mortgage Licensing System and Registry.</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(4) The State loan originator supervisory authority has a process in place for challenging information contained in the Nationwide Mortgage Licensing System and Registry.</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(5) The State loan originator supervisory authority has established a mechanism to assess civil money penalties for individuals acting as mortgage originators in their State without a valid license or registration.</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(6) The State loan originator supervisory authority has established minimum net worth or surety bonding requirements that reflect the dollar amount of loans originated by a residential mortgage loan originator, or has established a recovery fund paid into by the loan originators.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(e) Temporary extension of period</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">The Director may extend, by not more than 24 months, the 1-year or 2-year period, as the case may be, referred to in subsection (a) for the licensing of loan originators in any State under a State licensing law that meets the requirements of sections 5104 and 5105 of this title and subsection (d) if the Director determines that such State is making a good faith effort to establish a State licensing law that meets such requirements, license mortgage originators under such law, and register such originators with the Nationwide Mortgage Licensing System and Registry.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(f) Regulation authority</h4>
<h4 class="paragraph-head">(1) In general</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">The Bureau is authorized to promulgate regulations setting minimum net worth or surety bond requirements for residential mortgage loan originators and minimum requirements for recovery funds paid into by loan originators.</p>
<h4 class="paragraph-head">(2) Considerations</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">In issuing regulations under paragraph (1), the Bureau shall take into account the need to provide originators adequate incentives to originate affordable and sustainable mortgage loans, as well as the need to ensure a competitive origination market that maximizes consumer access to affordable and sustainable mortgage loans.</p>

Such order may, in addition to requiring a person to cease and desist from committing or causing a violation, require such person to comply, or to take steps to effect compliance, with such provision or regulation, upon such terms and conditions and within such time as the Director may specify in such order. Any such order may, as the Director deems appropriate, require future compliance or steps to effect future compliance, either permanently or for such period of time as the Director may specify, with such provision or regulation with respect to any loan originator.</p>

Such an order shall be entered only after notice and opportunity for a hearing, unless the Director determines that notice and hearing prior to entry would be impracticable or contrary to the public interest.

A respondent served with a temporary cease and desist order entered without a prior hearing before the Director may not apply to the court except after hearing and decision by the Director on the respondent's application under subparagraph (A).</p>
<h4 class="subparagraph-head">(C) No automatic stay of temporary order</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">The commencement of proceedings under subparagraph (B) shall not, unless specifically ordered by the court, operate as a stay of the Secretary's&#160;<sup><a href="#5113_1_target" name="5113_1">1</a></sup> order.</p>

<p class="statutory-body-1em">The Director may impose a civil penalty on a loan originator operating in any State which is subject to a licensing system established by the Director under section 5107 of this title, if the Director finds, on the record after notice and opportunity for hearing, that such loan originator has violated or failed to comply with any requirement of this chapter or any regulation prescribed by the Director under this chapter or order issued under subsection (c).</p>
