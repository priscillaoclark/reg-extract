Federal Reserve notes issued to any such bank shall, upon delivery, together with such notes of such Federal Reserve bank as may be issued under subchapter XIII&#160;<sup><a href="#414_1_target" name="414_1">1</a></sup> of this chapter upon security of United States 2 per centum Government bonds, become a first and paramount lien on all the assets of such bank.</p>
