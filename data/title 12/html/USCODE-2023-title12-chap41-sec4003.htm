<h4 class="paragraph-head">(1) Next business day availability of cash and certain items</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">Except as provided in paragraph (3), in the case of&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(A) any cash deposited in such account;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(B) any funds received by such depository institution by wire transfer for deposit in such account;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(C) any funds deposited in such account by cashier's check, certified check, teller's check, depository check, or traveler's check; and</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(D) any funds deposited by a government check which is described in subparagraph (A), (B), or (C) of section 4002(a)(2) of this title,</p>
<br class="Q04" />
<p class="statutory-body-block-1em">such cash or funds shall be available for withdrawal on the business day after the business day on which such cash or funds are deposited or, in the case of a wire transfer, on the business day after the business day on which such funds are received for deposit.</p>
<h4 class="paragraph-head">(2) Availability of other items</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">In the case of any funds deposited in such account by a check (other than a check described in subparagraph (C) or (D) of paragraph (1)), the availability for withdrawal of such funds shall not be subject to the provisions of section 4002(b), 4002(c), or paragraphs&#160;<sup><a href="#4003_1_target" name="4003_1">1</a></sup> (1) of section 4002(e) of this title.</p>
<h4 class="paragraph-head">(3) Limitation relating to certain checks in excess of $5,000</h4>

<p class="statutory-body-1em">In accordance with regulations which the Board, jointly with the Director of the Bureau of Consumer Financial Protection, shall prescribe, subsections (a)(2), (b), (c), and (e) of section 4002 of this title shall not apply with respect to any check deposited in an account at a depository institution if the receiving depository institution has reasonable cause to believe that the check is uncollectible from <!-- PDFPage:1585 -->the originating depository institution. For purposes of the preceding sentence, reasonable cause to believe requires the existence of facts which would cause a well-grounded belief in the mind of a reasonable person. Such reasons shall be included in the notice required under subsection (f).</p>
<h4 class="paragraph-head">(2) Basis for determination</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">No determination under this subsection may be based on any class of checks or persons.</p>
<h4 class="paragraph-head">(3) Overdraft fees</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">If the receiving depository institution determines that a check deposited in an account is a check described in paragraph (1), the receiving depository institution shall not assess any fee for any subsequent overdraft with respect to such account, if&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(A) the depositor was not provided with the written notice required under subsection (f) (with respect to such determination) at the time the deposit was made;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(B) the overdraft would not have occurred but for the fact that the funds so deposited are not available; and</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(C) the amount of the check is collected from the originating depository institution.</p>
<h4 class="paragraph-head">(4) Compliance</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">Each agency referred to in section 4009(a) of this title shall monitor compliance with the requirements of this subsection in each regular examination of a depository institution and shall describe in each report to the Congress the extent to which this subsection is being complied with. For the purpose of this paragraph, each depository institution shall retain a record of each notice provided under subsection (f) as a result of the application of this subsection.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(d) Emergency conditions</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">Subject to such regulations as the Board, jointly with the Director of the Bureau of Consumer Financial Protection, may prescribe, subsections (a)(2), (b), (c), and (e) of section 4002 of this title shall not apply to funds deposited by check in any receiving depository institution in the case of&mdash;</p>

<p class="statutory-body-1em">(2) suspension of payments by another depository institution;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(3) any war; or</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(4) any emergency condition beyond the control of the receiving depository institution,</p>
<br class="Q04" />

<h4 class="paragraph-head">(1) In general</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">The Board, jointly with the Director of the Bureau of Consumer Financial Protection, may, by regulation or order, suspend the applicability of this chapter, or any portion thereof, to any classification of checks if the Board, jointly with the Director of the Bureau of Consumer Financial Protection, determines that&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(A) depository institutions are experiencing an unacceptable level of losses due to check-related fraud, and</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(B) suspension of this chapter, or such portion of this chapter, with regard to the classification of checks involved in such fraud is necessary to diminish the volume of such fraud.</p>
<h4 class="paragraph-head">(2) Sunset provision</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">No regulation prescribed or order issued under paragraph (1) shall remain in effect for more than 45 days (excluding Saturdays, Sundays, legal holidays, or any day either House of Congress is not in session).</p>
<h4 class="paragraph-head">(3) Report to Congress</h4>
<h4 class="subparagraph-head">(A) Notice of each suspension</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">Within 10 days of prescribing any regulation or issuing any order under paragraph (1), the Board, jointly with the Director of the Bureau of Consumer Financial Protection, shall transmit a report of such action to the Committee on Banking, Finance and Urban Affairs of the House of Representatives and the Committee on Banking, Housing, and Urban Affairs of the Senate.</p>

<p class="statutory-body-2em">(A) the depository institution shall provide notice in the manner provided in paragraph (2) of&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-3em">(i) the time period within which the funds shall be made available for withdrawal; and</p>
<p class="statutory-body-3em">(ii) the reason the exception was invoked; and</p>
<br class="Q04" />
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(B) except where other time periods are specifically provided in this chapter, the availability of the funds deposited shall be governed by the policy of the receiving depository institution, but shall not exceed a reasonable period of time as determined by the Board, jointly with the Director of the Bureau of Consumer Financial Protection.</p>

<p class="statutory-body-2em">(E) In the case of a deposit to which subsection (b)(3) applies, the depository institution may, subject to regulations of the Board, provide notice at the beginning of each time period it determines that the subsection applies. In addition to the requirements contained in paragraph (1)(A), the notice shall specify the time period for which the exception will apply.</p>
<h4 class="paragraph-head">(3) Subsequent determinations</h4>
