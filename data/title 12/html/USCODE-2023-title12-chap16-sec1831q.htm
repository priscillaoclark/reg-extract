<p class="statutory-body-3em">The term &quot;affordable housing discount&quot; means, with respect to any eligible residential or eligible condominium property transferred under this section by the Corporation, the difference (if any) between the realizable disposition value of the property and the actual sale price of the property under this section.</p>
<h4 class="clause-head">(ii) Realizable disposition value</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-3em">The term &quot;realizable disposition value&quot; means the estimated sale price that the Corporation reasonably would be able to obtain upon the sale of a property by the Corporation under the provisions of this chapter, not including this section, and any other applicable laws. Not later than the expiration of the 120-day period beginning upon the commencement of the first fiscal year for which amounts are provided pursuant to paragraph (2)(A), the Corporation shall establish, and publish in the Federal Register, procedures for determining the realizable disposition value of <!-- PDFPage:1175 -->a property transferred under this section, which shall take into consideration such factors as the Corporation considers appropriate, including the actual sale prices of properties disposed of by the Resolution Trust Corporation under section 1441a(c)&#160;<sup><a href="#1831q_1_target" name="1831q_1">1</a></sup> of this title, the prices of other properties sold under similar programs, and the appraised value of the property transferred under this section.

<p class="statutory-body-1em">A qualifying multifamily purchaser receiving notice in accordance with paragraph (3) shall have 45 days (from the date notice is received) to make a bona fide offer to purchase the property. The Corporation shall accept an offer that complies with the terms and conditions established by the Corporation. If, before the expiration of such 45-day period, any offer to purchase a property initially accepted by the Corporation is subsequently rejected or fails (for any reason), the Corporation shall accept another offer to purchase the property made during such period that complies with the terms and conditions established by the Corporation (if such another offer is made).
