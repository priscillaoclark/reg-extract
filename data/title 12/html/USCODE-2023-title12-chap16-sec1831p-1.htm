<p class="statutory-body-2em">(A) to preserve the safety and soundness of the institution; or</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(B) in connection with any action under section 1818 of this title or any order issued <!-- PDFPage:1173 -->by the agency, any agreement between the agency and the institution, or any condition imposed by the agency in connection with the agency's approval of an application or other request by the institution, which is enforceable under section 1818 of this title.</p>

<p class="statutory-body-3em">(ii) require the agency to act on plans expeditiously, and generally not later than 30 days after the plan is submitted.</p>
<h4 class="paragraph-head">(2) Order required if institution fails to submit or implement plan</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">If an insured depository institution fails to submit an acceptable plan within the time allowed under paragraph (1)(C), or fails in any material respect to implement a plan accepted by the appropriate Federal banking agency, the agency, by order&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(A) shall require the institution to correct the deficiency; and</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(B) may do 1 or more of the following until the deficiency has been corrected:</p>
<p class="statutory-body-3em">(i) Prohibit the institution from permitting its average total assets during any calendar quarter to exceed its average total assets during the preceding calendar quarter, or restrict the rate at which the average total assets of the institution may increase from one calendar quarter to another.</p>

<h4 class="paragraph-head">(3) Restrictions mandatory for certain institutions</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">In complying with paragraph (2), the appropriate Federal banking agency shall take 1 or more of the actions described in clauses (i) through (iii) of paragraph (2)(B) if&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(A) the agency determines that the insured depository institution fails to meet any standard prescribed under subsection (a)(1) or (b)(1);</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(B) the institution has not corrected the deficiency; and</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(C) either&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-3em">(i) during the 24-month period before the date on which the institution first failed to meet the standard&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-4em">(I) the institution commenced operations; or</p>
<p class="statutory-body-4em">(II) 1 or more persons acquired control of the institution; or</p>
<br class="Q04" />
<p class="statutory-body-3em">(ii) during the 18-month period before the date on which the institution first failed to meet the standard, the institution underwent extraordinary growth, as defined by the agency.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(f) Definitions</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">For purposes of this section, the terms &quot;average&quot; and &quot;capital restoration plan&quot; have the same meanings as in section 1831o of this title.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(g) Other authority not affected</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">The authority granted by this section is in addition to any other authority of the Federal banking agencies.</p>
