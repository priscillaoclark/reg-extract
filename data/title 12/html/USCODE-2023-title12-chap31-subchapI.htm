So long as any class A notes are outstanding, the Bank shall not pay any dividend on any class of stock at a rate greater than the statutory interest rate payable on class A notes. Class B and class C stock shall be common stock with voting rights as provided for herein and shall be issued only to eligible borrowers and organizations controlled by such borrowers or organizations eligible to borrow, and shall be transferable only on the books of the Bank and then only to another eligible borrower.

Any such interest payment may be deferred by the Board of Directors with the approval of the Secretary of the Treasury, except that any interest payment so deferred shall bear interest at a rate equal to the rate determined pursuant to the first sentence of this subsection. Without the approval of the Secretary of the Treasury, the Bank shall not pay any dividend or distribution on, or make any redemption or repurchase of, any class of stock at any time when the deferred interest payments on class A notes shall not have been paid in full, together with any unpaid interest on such notes.

Such additional stock ownership requirements may be on the basis of the face amount of the loan, the outstanding balances, or on a percentage of interest payable during any year or any quarter thereof, as the Bank may determine will provide adequate capital for the operation of the Bank and equitable ownership thereof among borrowers.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(e) Class C stock; purchase, dividends, etc.</h4>

<p class="statutory-body">For the purpose of all subchapters of this chapter, subject to the limitations of subsection (d) of this section, an eligible cooperative is an organization chartered or operated on a cooperative, not-for-profit basis for producing or furnishing goods, services or facilities, primarily for the benefit of its members or voting stockholders who are ultimate consumers of such goods, services, or facilities, or a legally chartered entity primarily owned and controlled by any such organization or organizations, if it&mdash;</p>

<p class="statutory-body-1em">(3) provides that its net savings shall be allocated or distributed to all members or patrons, in proportion to their patronage, or shall be retained for the actual or potential expansion of its services or the reduction of its charges to the patrons, or for such other purposes as may be authorized by its membership not inconsistent with its purposes;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(4) makes membership available on a voluntary basis, without any social, political, racial, or religious discrimination and without any discrimination on the basis of age, sex, or marital status, to all persons who can make use of its services and are willing to accept the responsibilities of membership, subject only to limitations under applicable Federal or State laws or regulations;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(5) in the case of primary cooperative organizations restricts its voting control to members or voting stockholders on a one vote per person basis (except that this requirement shall not apply to any housing cooperative in existence on March 21, 1980, which did not meet such requirement on such date) and takes positive steps to insure economic democracy and maximum participation by members of the cooperative including the holding of annual meetings and, in the case of organizations owned by groups of cooperatives, provides positive protections to insure economic democracy; and</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(6) is not a credit union, mutual savings bank, or mutual savings and loan association.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(b) Primary producers</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">No organization shall be ineligible because it produces, markets, or furnishes goods, services, or facilities on behalf of its members as primary producers, unless the dollar volume of loans made by the Bank to such organizations exceeds 10 per centum of the gross assets of the Bank.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(c) &quot;Net savings&quot; defined</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">As used in this section, the term &quot;net savings&quot; means, for any period, the borrower's gross receipts, less the operating and other expenses deductible therefrom in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles, including, without limitation, contributions to allowable reserves, and after deducting the amounts of any dividends on its capital stock or other membership capital payable during, or within forty-five days after, the close of such period.</p>

<h4 class="subsection-head">(e) Credit unions eligible for technical assistance from Office of Self-Help Development and Technical Assistance</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">Notwithstanding any other provision of this section, a credit union serving predominantly low-income members (as defined by the Administrator of the National Credit Union Administration) may receive technical assistance under subchapter II.</p>

<!-- field-end:head -->
<!-- field-start:statute -->
<h4 class="subsection-head">(a) General requirements for loans and commitments for loans; limitations; allocation of assistance for low-income persons; criteria and factors for making loans, etc.; publication</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">The Bank may make loans and commitments for loans under this subsection to any organization determined by the Bank to be eligible under the provisions of section 3015 of this title, and may purchase or discount obligations of members of such organizations if the Bank, to the exclusion of all other persons, entities, agencies, or jurisdictions, also determines that the applicant has or will have a sound organizational and financial structure, income in excess of its operating costs and assets in excess of its obligations, and a reasonable expectation of a continuing demand for its production, goods, commodities, or services, or the use of its facilities, so that the loan will be fully repayable in accordance with its terms and conditions. Commencing on October 1, 1985, the Bank shall not make any loan to a cooperative for the purpose of financing the construction, ownership, acquisition, or improvement of any structure used primarily for residential purposes if, after giving effect to such loan, the aggregate amount of all loans outstanding for such purpose would exceed 30 per centum of the gross assets of the Bank. The Board of Directors shall use its best efforts to insure that at the end of each fiscal year of the Bank at least 35 per centum of its outstanding loans are to&mdash;</p>
<!-- PDFPage:1487 --><p class="statutory-body-1em">(1) cooperatives at least a majority of the members of which are low-income persons, and</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(2) other cooperatives, if the proceeds of such loans are directly applied to finance a facility, activity, or service that the Board finds will be used predominantly by low-income persons.</p>
<br class="Q04" />
<p class="statutory-body-block">The Board shall adopt and publish in the Federal Register rules defining the term &quot;low-income persons&quot; for purposes of this subsection. The criteria to be applied and the factors to be considered by the Bank in making loans, loan commitments, purchases, discounts, and guarantees shall include an assessment of the impact of the loan on existing small businesses in the eligible organizations&apos; business territory. The criteria and factors shall be stated in rules of the Bank which shall be published and made available to applicants and, upon request, to any other person or organization.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(b) Repayment requirements; criteria for terms, rates, and charges; advancement of loan proceeds</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">Loans under this section shall be repayable in not more than forty years and, except for loans with final due date not longer than five years from the date of the loan, shall be amortized as to principal and interest. In setting the terms, rates, and charges, it shall be the objective of the Bank to provide the type of credit needed by eligible borrowers, at the lowest reasonable cost on a sound business basis, taking into account the cost of money to the Bank, necessary reserve and expenses of the Bank, and the technical and other assistance attributable to loans under this section made available by the Bank. The loan terms may provide for interest rates to vary from time to time during the repayment period of the loan in accordance with the rates being charged by the Bank for new loans at such times. The proceeds of a loan under this subsection may be advanced by the borrower to its members or stockholders under circumstances described in the bylaws or rules of the Bank.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(c) Guarantees by Bank; requirements; charges</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">Subject to section 3012(13) of this title, the Bank may guarantee all or any part of the principal and interest of any loan made by any State or federally chartered lending institution to any borrower if such loan is to an organization that would be an eligible borrower from the Bank for a direct loan and is on terms and conditions (including the rate of interest) which would be permissible terms and conditions for such a direct loan. The Bank may impose a charge for any such guarantee. No loan may be guaranteed by the Bank if the income therefrom to the lender is excluded from such lender's gross income for purposes of chapter 1 of title 26.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(d) Assignment of guaranteed loans; contestability of guarantee; criteria for purchase by Bank of guaranteed loan in lieu of requiring service by lender</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">Any loan guaranteed under subsection (c) shall be assignable to the extent provided in the contract of guarantee as may be determined by the Bank. The guarantee shall be uncontestable, except for fraud or misrepresentation of which the holder had actual knowledge at the time he acquired the loan. The Bank in lieu of requiring such lender to service such guaranteed loan until final maturity or liquidation, may purchase the loan for the balance of the principal and accrued interest thereon without penalty, if it determines that (1) the liquidation of the loan would result in the insolvency of the borrower or deprive the borrower of assets essential to its continued operation, and (2) the loan will be repayable with revision of the loan rates, terms, or payment periods or other conditions not inconsistent with loans made by the Bank under subsection (a) of this section, which revisions the lender or other holder of such guaranteed loan is unwilling to make.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(e) Aggregate amount of commitments to make or guarantee loans</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">As long as any of the class A stock of the Bank is held by the Secretary of the Treasury, the aggregate amount of commitments by the Bank to make or guarantee loans shall not exceed such amounts as may be specified in annual appropriation Acts.</p>
