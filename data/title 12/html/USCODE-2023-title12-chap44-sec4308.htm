<p class="note-body">Section 4311(b) of this title, referred to in subsec. (a)(4), was in the original &quot;section 12(b)&quot;, probably meaning section 12(b) of Pub.

L. 102&ndash;242, and section 272(b) of Pub. L. 102&ndash;242 relates to regulations prescribed by the National Credit Union Administration Board.</p>
