<p class="statutory-body-1em">(3)(A) in the case of a foreclosure involving a monetary default, there is tendered to the foreclosure commissioner before public auction is completed the entire amount of principal and interest which would be due if payments under the mortgage had not been accelerated; (B) in the case of a foreclosure involving a nonmonetary default, the foreclosure commissioner, upon application of the mortgagor before the date of foreclosure sale, finds that such default is cured; and (C) there is tendered to the foreclosure commissioner before public auction is completed all amounts due under the mortgage agreement (excluding additional amounts which would have been due if mortgage payments had been accelerated), all amounts of expenditures secured by the mortgage and all costs of foreclosure incurred for which payment from the proceeds of foreclosure is provided in section 3711 of this title, except that the Secretary shall have discretion to refuse to cancel a foreclosure pursuant to this paragraph (3) if the current mortgagor or owner of record has on one or more previous occasions caused a foreclosure of the mortgage, commenced pursuant to this chapter or otherwise, to be canceled by curing a default.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(b) Views of Secretary</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">Prior to withdrawing the security property from foreclosure in the circumstances described in subsection (a)(2) or (a)(3), the foreclosure commissioner shall afford the Secretary a reasonable opportunity to demonstrate why the security property should not be so withdrawn.</p>
