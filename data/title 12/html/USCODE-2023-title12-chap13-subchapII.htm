<p class="statutory-body-2em">The Board may issue a letter of reprimand only once to a mortgagee without taking action under subparagraphs&#160;<sup><a href="#1708_2_target" name="1708_2">2</a></sup> (B), (C), or (D) of this section. A letter of reprimand shall explain the violation and describe actions the mortgagee should take to correct the violation.</p>
<h4 class="subparagraph-head">(B) Probation</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">The Board may place a mortgagee on probation for a specified period of time not to exceed 6 months for the purpose of evaluating the mortgagee's compliance with Federal Housing Administration requirements, the Equal Credit Opportunity Act [15 U.S.C. 1691 et seq.], the Fair Housing Act [42 U.S.C. 3601 et seq.], Executive Order 11063, or orders of the Board.

A suspension shall last for not less than 6 months, and for not longer than 1 year. The Board may extend the suspension for an additional 6 months if it determines the extension is in the public interest. If the Board and the mortgagee agree, these time limits may be extended.

<p class="statutory-body">The Secretary is authorized, upon application by the mortgagee, to insure as hereinafter provided any mortgage offered to him which is eligible for insurance as hereinafter provided, and, upon such terms as the Secretary may prescribe, to make commitments for the insuring of such mortgages prior to the date of their execution or disbursement thereon.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(b) Eligibility for insurance; mortgage limits</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">To be eligible for insurance under this section a mortgage shall comply with the following:</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(1) Have been made to, and be held by, a mortgagee approved by the Secretary as responsible and able to service the mortgage properly.</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(2) Involve a principal obligation (including such initial service charges, appraisal, inspection, and other fees as the Secretary shall approve) in an amount&mdash;</p>

<p class="statutory-body-3em">(ii) 150 percent of the dollar amount limitation determined under the sixth sentence of such section 1454(a)(2) for a residence of applicable size;</p>
<br class="Q04" />
<p class="statutory-body-block-2em" style="padding-left:2em text-indent:0em">except that the dollar amount limitation in effect under this subparagraph for any size residence for any area may not be less than the greater of: (I) the dollar amount limitation in effect under this section for the area on October 21, 1998; or (II) 65 percent of the dollar amount limitation determined under the sixth sentence of such section 1454(a)(2) for a residence of the applicable size; and</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(B) not to exceed 100 percent of the appraised value of the property.</p>
<br class="Q04" />
<p class="statutory-body-block-1em">For purposes of the preceding sentence, the term &quot;area&quot; means a metropolitan statistical area as established by the Office of Management and Budget; and the median 1-family house price for an area shall be equal to the median 1-family house price of the county within the area that has the highest such median price. Notwithstanding any other provision of this paragraph, the amount which may be insured under this section may be increased by up to 20 percent if such increase is necessary to account for the increased cost of the residence due to the installation of a solar energy system (as defined in subparagraph (3) of the last paragraph of section 1703(a) of this title) therein.</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">Notwithstanding any other provision of this paragraph, the Secretary may not insure, or enter into a commitment to insure, a mortgage under this section that is executed by a first-time homebuyer and that involves a principal obligation (including such initial service charges, appraisal, inspection, and other fees as the Secretary shall approve) in excess of 97 percent of the appraised value of the property unless the mortgagor has completed a program of counseling with respect to the responsibilities and financial management involved in homeownership that is approved by the Secretary; except that the Secretary may, in the discretion of the Secretary, waive the applicability of this requirement.</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(3) Have a maturity satisfactory to the Secretary, but not to exceed, in any event, thirty-five years (or thirty years if such mortgage is not approved for insurance prior to construction) from the date of the beginning of amortization of the mortgage.</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(4) Contain complete amortization provisions satisfactory to the Secretary requiring periodic payments by the mortgagor not in excess of his reasonable ability to pay as determined by the Secretary.</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(5) Bear interest at such rate as may be agreed upon by the mortgagor and the mortgagee.</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(6) Provide, in a manner satisfactory to the Secretary, for the application of the mortgagor's periodic payments (exclusive of the amount allocated to interest and to the premium charge which is required for mortgage insurance as hereinafter provided) to amortization of the principal of the mortgage.</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(7) Contain such terms and provisions with respect to insurance, repairs, alterations, payment of taxes, default, reserves, delinquency charges, foreclosure proceedings, anticipation of maturity, additional and secondary liens, and other matters as the Secretary may in his discretion prescribe.</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(8) Repealed. Pub. L. 100&ndash;242, title IV, &sect;406(b)(2), Feb. 5, 1988, 101 Stat. 1900.</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(9) <cap-smallcap>Cash investment requirement.&mdash;</cap-smallcap></p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(A) <cap-smallcap>In general</cap-smallcap>.&mdash;A mortgage insured under this section shall be executed by a mortgagor who shall have paid, in cash or its equivalent, on account of the property an amount equal to not less than 3.5 percent of the appraised value of the property or such larger amount as the Secretary may determine.</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(B) <cap-smallcap>Family members</cap-smallcap>.&mdash;For purposes of this paragraph, the Secretary shall consider as cash or its equivalent any amounts borrowed from a family member (as such term is defined in section 1707 of this title), subject only to the requirements that, in any case in which the repayment of such borrowed amounts is secured by a lien against the property, that&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-3em">(i) such lien shall be subordinate to the mortgage; and</p>
<p class="statutory-body-3em">(ii) the sum of the principal obligation of the mortgage and the obligation secured by such lien may not exceed 100 percent of the appraised value of the property plus any initial service charges, appraisal, inspection, and other fees in connection with the mortgage.</p>
<br class="Q04" />
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(C) <cap-smallcap>Prohibited sources</cap-smallcap>.&mdash;In no case shall the funds required by subparagraph (A) con<!-- PDFPage:541 -->sist, in whole or in part, of funds provided by any of the following parties before, during, or after closing of the property sale:</p>
<p class="statutory-body-3em">(i) The seller or any other person or entity that financially benefits from the transaction.</p>
<p class="statutory-body-3em">(ii) Any third party or entity that is reimbursed, directly or indirectly, by any of the parties described in clause (i).</p>
<br class="Q04" />
<p class="statutory-body-block-2em" style="padding-left:2em text-indent:0em">This subparagraph shall apply only to mortgages for which the mortgagee has issued credit approval for the borrower on or after October 1, 2008.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(c) Premium charges</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">(1) The Secretary is authorized to fix premium charges for the insurance of mortgages under the separate sections of this subchapter but in the case of any mortgage such charge shall be not less than an amount equivalent to one-fourth of 1 per centum per annum nor more than an amount equivalent to 1 per centum per annum of the amount of the principal obligation of the mortgage outstanding at any time, without taking into account delinquent payments or prepayments: <i>Provided</i>, That premium charges fixed for insurance (1) under section 1715z&ndash;10,<sup><a href="#1709_1_target" name="1709_1">1</a></sup> 1715z&ndash;12, 1715z&ndash;16, 1715z&ndash;17, or 1715z&ndash;18 of this title, or any other financing mechanism providing alternative methods for repayment of a mortgage that is determined by the Secretary to involve additional risk, or (2) under subsection (n) are not required to be the same as the premium charges for mortgages insured under the other provisions of this section, but in no case shall premium charges under subsection (n) exceed 1 per centum per annum: <i>Provided</i>, That any reduced premium charge so fixed and computed may, in the discretion of the Secretary, also be made applicable in such manner as the Secretary shall prescribe to each insured mortgage outstanding under the section or sections involved at the time the reduced premium charge is fixed. Such premium charges shall be payable by the mortgagee, either in cash, or in debentures issued by the Secretary under this subchapter at par plus accrued interest, in such manner as may be prescribed by the Secretary: <i>Provided</i>, That debentures presented in payment of premium charges shall represent obligations of the particular insurance fund or account to which such premium charges are to be credited: <i>Provided further</i>, That the Secretary may require the payment of one or more such premium charges at the time the mortgage is insured, at such discount rate as he may prescribe not in excess of the interest rate specified in the mortgage. If the Secretary finds upon the presentation of a mortgage for insurance and the tender of the initial premium charge or charges so required that the mortgage complies with the provisions of this section, such mortgage may be accepted for insurance by endorsement or otherwise as the Secretary may prescribe; but no mortgage shall be accepted for insurance under this section unless the Secretary finds that the project with respect to which the mortgage is executed is economically sound. In the event that the principal obligation of any mortgage accepted for insurance is paid in full prior to the maturity date, the Secretary is further authorized in his discretion to require the payment by the mortgagee of an adjusted premium charge in such amount as the Secretary determines to be equitable, but not in excess of the aggregate amount of the premium charges that the mortgagee would otherwise have been required to pay if the mortgage had continued to be insured under this section until such maturity date; and in the event that the principal obligation is paid in full as herein set forth the Secretary is authorized to refund to the mortgagee for the account of the mortgagor all, or such portion as he shall determine to be equitable, of the current unearned premium charges theretofore paid: <i>Provided</i>, That with respect to mortgages (1) for which the Secretary requires, at the time the mortgage is insured, the payment of a single premium charge to cover the total premium obligation for the insurance of the mortgage, and (2) on which the principal obligation is paid before the number of years on which the premium with respect to a particular mortgage was based, or the property is sold subject to the mortgage or is sold and the mortgage is assumed prior to such time, the Secretary shall provide for refunds, where appropriate, of a portion of the premium paid and shall provide for appropriate allocation of the premium cost among the mortgagors over the term of the mortgage, in accordance with procedures established by the Secretary which take into account sound financial and actuarial considerations.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(2) Notwithstanding any other provision of this section, each mortgage secured by a 1- to 4-family dwelling that is an obligation of the Mutual Mortgage Insurance Fund shall be subject to the following requirements:</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(A) The Secretary shall establish and collect, at the time of insurance, a single premium payment in an amount not exceeding 3 percent of the amount of the original insured principal obligation of the mortgage. In the case of a mortgage for which the mortgagor is a first-time homebuyer who completes a program of counseling with respect to the responsibilities and financial management involved in homeownership that is approved by the Secretary, the premium payment under this subparagraph shall not exceed 2.75 percent of the amount of the original insured principal obligation of the mortgage. Upon payment in full of the principal obligation of a mortgage prior to the maturity date of the mortgage, the Secretary shall refund all of the unearned premium charges paid on the mortgage pursuant to this subparagraph, provided that the mortgagor refinances the unpaid principal obligation under this subchapter.</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(B) In addition to the premium under subparagraph (A), the Secretary may establish and collect annual premium payments in an amount not exceeding 1.5 percent of the remaining insured principal balance (excluding the portion of the remaining balance attributable to the premium collected under subparagraph (A) and without taking into account delinquent payments or prepayments) for the following periods:</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(i) For any mortgage involving an original principal obligation (excluding any premium <!-- PDFPage:542 -->collected under subparagraph (A)) that is less than 90 percent of the appraised value of the property (as of the date the mortgage is accepted for insurance), for the first 11 years of the mortgage term.</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(ii) For any mortgage involving an original principal obligation (excluding any premium collected under subparagraph (A)) that is greater than or equal to 90 percent of such value, for the first 30 years of the mortgage term; except that notwithstanding the matter preceding clause (i), for any mortgage involving an original principal obligation (excluding any premium collected under subparagraph (A)) that is greater than 95 percent of such value, the annual premium collected during the 30-year period under this clause may be in an amount not exceeding 1.55 percent of the remaining insured principal balance (excluding the portion of the remaining balance attributable to the premium collected under subparagraph (A) and without taking into account delinquent payments or prepayments).</p>
<br class="Q04" />
<h4 class="subsection-head">(d) Increase in maximum amount of mortgage</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">(1) Except as provided in paragraph (2) of this subsection, notwithstanding&#160;<sup><a href="#1709_2_target" name="1709_2">2</a></sup> provision of this subchapter governing maximum mortgage amounts for insuring a mortgage secured by a one- to four-family dwelling, the maximum amount of the mortgage determined under any such provision may be increased by the amount of the mortgage insurance premium paid at the time the mortgage is insured.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(2) The maximum amount of a mortgage determined under subsection (b)(2)(B) of this section may not be increased as provided in paragraph (1).</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(e) Contract of insurance as evidence of eligibility</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">Any contract of insurance heretofore or hereafter executed by the Secretary under this subchapter shall be conclusive evidence of the eligibility of the loan or mortgage for insurance, and the validity of any contract of insurance so executed shall be incontestable in the hands of an approved financial institution or approved mortgagee from the date of the execution of such contract, except for fraud or misrepresentation on the part of such approved financial institution or approved mortgagee.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(f) Disclosure of other mortgage products</h4>
<h4 class="paragraph-head">(1) In general</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">In conjunction with any loan insured under this section, an original lender shall provide to each prospective borrower a disclosure notice that provides a 1-page analysis of mortgage products offered by that lender and for which the borrower would qualify.</p>

<p class="statutory-body-1em">The notice required under paragraph (1) shall include&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(A) a generic analysis comparing the note rate (and associated interest payments), insurance premiums, and other costs and fees that would be due over the life of the loan for a loan insured by the Secretary under subsection (b) with the note rates, insurance premiums (if applicable), and other costs and fees that would be expected to be due if the mortgagor obtained instead other mortgage products offered by the lender and for which the borrower would qualify with a similar loan-to-value ratio in connection with a conventional mortgage (as that term is used in section 1454(a)(2) of this title or section 1717(b)(2) of this title, as applicable), assuming prevailing interest rates; and</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(B) a statement regarding when the requirement of the mortgagor to pay the mortgage insurance premiums for a mortgage insured under this section would terminate, or a statement that the requirement shall terminate only if the mortgage is refinanced, paid off, or otherwise terminated.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(g) Limitation on use of single family mortgage insurance by investors</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">(1) The Secretary may insure a mortgage under this subchapter that is secured by a 1- to 4-family dwelling, or approve a substitute mortgagor with respect to any such mortgage, only if the mortgagor is to occupy the dwelling as his or her principal residence or as a secondary residence, as determined by the Secretary. In making this determination with respect to the occupancy of secondary residences, the Secretary may not insure mortgages with respect to such residences unless the Secretary determines that it is necessary to avoid undue hardship to the mortgagor. In no event may a secondary residence under this subsection include a vacation home, as determined by the Secretary.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(2) The occupancy requirement established in paragraph (1) shall not apply to any mortgagor (or co-mortgagor, as appropriate) that is&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(A) a public entity, as provided in section 1715d or 1715z&ndash;12 of this title, or any other State or local government or an agency thereof;</p>

<br class="Q04" />
<p class="statutory-body">(3) For purposes of this subsection, the term &quot;substitute mortgagor&quot; means a person who, <!-- PDFPage:543 -->upon the release by a mortgagee of a previous mortgagor from personal liability on the mortgage note, assumes such liability and agrees to pay the mortgage debt.</p>

<h4 class="subsection-head">(i) Repealed. Pub. L. 110&ndash;289, div. B, title I, &sect;2120(a)(1), July 30, 2008, 122 Stat. 2835</h4>

<p class="statutory-body">(1) The Secretary may, in order to assist in the rehabilitation of one- to four-family structures used primarily for residential purposes, insure and make commitments to insure rehabilitation loans (including advances made during rehabilitation) made by financial institutions.

<h4 class="clause-head">(ii) Other considerations</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-3em">The Secretary may increase the percentage applicable pursuant to clause (i) to a condominium project on a project-by-project or regional basis, and in determining such percentage for a project shall consider factors relating to the economy for the locality in which such project is located or specific to project,<sup><a href="#1709_2_target" name="1709_2">2</a></sup> including the total number of family units in the project.</p>

All such debentures shall be dated as of the date foreclosure proceedings were instituted, or the property was otherwise acquired by the mortgagee after default: <i>Provided</i>, That debentures issued pursuant to claims for insurance filed on or after September 2, 1964 shall be dated as of the date of default or as of such later date as the Secretary, in his discretion, may establish by regulation.

<p class="statutory-body-1em">(7) The term &quot;State&quot; includes the several States, and Puerto Rico, the District of Columbia, Guam, the Trust Territory of the Pacific Islands, American Samoa, and the Virgin Islands.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(b) Insurance of additional mortgages</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">In addition to mortgages insured under section 1709 of this title, the Secretary is authorized to insure mortgages as defined in this section (including advances on such mortgages during construction) which cover property held by&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(1) Federal or State instrumentalities, municipal corporate instrumentalities of one or more States, or limited dividend or redevelopment or housing corporations restricted by Federal or State laws or regulations of State banking or insurance departments as to rents, charges, capital structure, rate of return, or methods of operation; or</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(2) any other mortgagor approved by the Secretary. The Secretary may, in the Secretary's discretion, require any such mortgagor to be regulated or restricted as to rents or sales, charges, capital structure, rate of return, and methods of operation so as to provide reasonable rentals to tenants and a reasonable return on the investment. Any such regulations or restrictions shall continue for such period or periods as the Secretary, in the Secretary's discretion, may require, including until the termination of all obligations of the Secretary under the insurance and during such further period of time as the Secretary shall be the owner, holder, or reinsurer of the mortgage. The Secretary may make such contracts with and acquire, for not to exceed $100, such stock or interest in the mortgagor as he may deem necessary to render effective any such regulations or restrictions. The stock or interest acquired by the Secretary shall be paid for out of the General Insurance Fund, and shall be redeemed by the mortgagor at par upon the termination of all obligations of the Secretary under the insurance.</p>
<br class="Q04" />
<p class="statutory-body">The insurance of mortgages under this section is intended to facilitate particularly the production of rental accommodations, at reasonable rents, of design and size suitable for family living. The Secretary is, therefore, authorized in the administration of this section to take action, by regulation or otherwise, which will direct the benefits of mortgage insurance hereunder primarily to those projects which make adequate provision for families with children, and in which every effort has been made to achieve moderate rental charges.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">Notwithstanding any other provisions of this section, the Secretary may not insure any mortgage under this section (except a mortgage with respect to a manufactured home park designed exclusively for occupancy by elderly persons) unless the mortgagor certifies under oath that in selecting tenants for the property covered by the mortgage he will not discriminate against any family by reason of the fact that there are children in the family, and that he will not sell the property while the insurance is in effect unless the purchaser so certifies, such certification to be filed with the Secretary. Violation of any such certification shall be a misdemeanor punishable by a fine of not to exceed $500.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(c) Eligibility for insurance; mortgage limits</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">To be eligible for insurance under this section a mortgage on any property or project shall involve a principal obligation in an amount&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(1) Repealed. Pub. L. 93&ndash;383, title III, &sect;304(a)(1), Aug. 22, 1974, 88 Stat. 677.</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(2) Not to exceed 90 per centum of the estimated value of the property or project (when the proposed improvements are completed): <i>Provided</i>, That this limitation shall not apply to mortgages on housing in Alaska or in Guam, but such a mortgage may involve a principal obligation in an amount not to exceed 90 per centum of the amount which the Secretary estimates will be the replacement cost of the property or project when the proposed improvements are completed (the value of the property or project as such term is used in this paragraph may include the land, the proposed physical improvements, utilities within the boundaries of the property or project, architect's fees, taxes, and interest accruing during construction, and other miscellaneous charges incident to construction and approved by the Secretary): <i>And provided further</i>, That nothing contained in this section shall preclude the insurance of mortgages covering existing construction located in slum or blighted areas, as defined in paragraph (5) of subsection (a) of this section, and the Sec<!-- PDFPage:574 -->retary may require such repair or rehabilitation work to be completed as is, in his discretion, necessary to remove conditions detrimental to safety, health, or morals; and</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(3)(A) Not to exceed, for such part of the property or project as may be attributable to dwelling use (excluding exterior land improvements as defined by the Secretary), $38,025 per family unit without a bedroom, $42,120 per family unit with one bedroom, $50,310 per family unit with two bedrooms, $62,010 per family unit with three bedrooms, and $70,200 per family unit with four or more bedrooms, or not to exceed $17,460 per space; except that as to projects to consist of elevator type structures the Secretary may in his discretion, increase the dollar amount limitations per family unit to not to exceed $43,875 per family unit without a bedroom, $49,140 per family unit with one bedroom, $60,255 per family unit with two bedrooms, $75,465 per family unit with three bedrooms, and $85,328 per family unit with four or more bedrooms, as the case may be, to compensate for the higher costs incident to the construction of elevator-type structures of sound standards of construction and design;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(B) the Secretary may, by regulation, increase any of the dollar amount limitations in subparagraph (A) (as such limitations may have been adjusted in accordance with section 1712a of this title) by not to exceed 170 percent in any geographical area where the Secretary finds that cost levels so require and by not to exceed 170 percent, or 215 percent in high cost areas, where the Secretary determines it necessary on a project-by-project basis, but in no case may any such increase exceed 90 percent where the Secretary determines that a mortgage purchased or to be purchased by the Government National Mortgage Association in implementing its special assistance functions under section 1720&#160;<sup><a href="#1713_1_target" name="1713_1">1</a></sup> of this title (as such section existed immediately before November 30, 1983) is involved. Notwithstanding any other provision of this paragraph, the amount which may be insured under this section may be increased by up to 20 percent if such increase is necessary to account for the increased cost of the project due to the installation therein of a solar energy system (as defined in subparagraph (3) of the last paragraph of section 1703(a) of this title) or residential energy conservation measures (as defined in section 8211(11)(A) through (G) and (I) of title 42)&#160;<sup><a href="#1713_1_target" name="1713_1">1</a></sup> in cases where the Secretary determines that such measures are in addition to those required under the minimum property standards and will be cost-effective over the life of the measure.</p>
<br class="Q04" />
<p class="statutory-body">The mortgage shall provide for complete amortization by periodic payments (unless otherwise approved by the Secretary) within such term as the Secretary shall prescribe, and shall bear interest at such rate as may be agreed upon by the mortgagor and the mortgagee. The Secretary may consent to the release of a part or parts of the mortgaged property from the lien of the mortgage upon such terms and conditions as he may prescribe and the mortgage may provide for such release. No mortgage shall be accepted for insurance under this section or section 1715a&#160;<sup><a href="#1713_1_target" name="1713_1">1</a></sup> of this title unless the Secretary finds that the property or project, with respect to which the mortgage is executed, is economically sound. Such property or project may include five or more family units and may include such commercial and community facilities as the Secretary deems adequate to serve the occupants.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(d) Premium, appraisal, and inspection charges</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">The Secretary shall collect a premium charge for the insurance of mortgages under this section which shall be payable annually in advance by the mortgagee, either in cash or in debentures issued by the Secretary under any subchapter and section of this chapter, except debentures of the Mutual Mortgage Insurance Fund, or of the Cooperative Management Housing Insurance Fund at par plus accrued interest. In addition to the premium charge herein provided for the Secretary is authorized to charge and collect such amounts as he may deem reasonable for the appraisal of a property or project offered for insurance and for the inspection of such property or project during construction: <i>Provided</i>, That such charges for appraisal and inspection shall not aggregate more than 1 per centum of the original principal face amount of the mortgage.</p>

<h4 class="subsection-head">(g) Payment of insurance after default</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">The failure of the mortgagor to make any payment due under or provided to be paid by the terms of a mortgage insured under this section shall be considered a default under such mortgage and, if such default continues for a period of thirty days, the mortgagee shall be entitled to receive the benefits of the insurance as hereinafter provided, upon assignment, transfer, and delivery to the Secretary, within a period and in accordance with rules and regulations to be prescribed by the Secretary of (1) all rights and interests arising under the mortgage so in default; (2) all claims of the mortgagee against the mortgagor or others, arising out of the mortgage transactions; (3) all policies of title or other insurance or surety bonds or other guaranties and any and all claims thereunder; (4) any balance of the mortgage loans not advanced to the mortgagor; (5) any cash or property held by the mortgagee, or to which it is entitled, as deposits <!-- PDFPage:575 -->made for the account of the mortgagor and which have not been applied in reduction of the principal of the mortgage indebtedness; and (6) all records, documents, books, papers, and accounts relating to the mortgage transactions. Upon such assignment, transfer, and delivery the obligation of the mortgagee to pay the premium charges for mortgage insurance shall cease, and the Secretary shall issue to the mortgagee a certificate of claim as provided in subsection (h), and debentures having a par value equal to the original principal face amount of the mortgage plus such amount as the mortgagee may have paid for (A) taxes, special assessments, and water rates, which are liens prior to the mortgage; (B) insurance on the property; and (C) reasonable expenses for the completion and preservation of the property and any mortgage insurance premiums paid after default, less the sum of (i) that part of the amount of the principal obligation that has been repaid by the mortgagor, (ii) an amount equivalent to 1 per centum of the unpaid amount of such principal obligation, and (iii) any net income received by the mortgagee from the property: <i>Provided</i>, That the mortgagee in the event of a default under the mortgage may, at its option and in accordance with regulations of, and in a period to be determined by, the Secretary, proceed to foreclose on and obtain possession of or otherwise acquire such property from the mortgagor after default, and receive the benefits of the insurance as herein provided, upon (1) the prompt conveyance to the Secretary of title to the property which meets the requirements of the rules and regulations of the Secretary in force at the time the mortgage was insured and which is evidenced in the manner prescribed by such rules and regulations, and (2) the assignment to him of all claims of the mortgagee against the mortgagor or others, arising out of the mortgage transaction or foreclosure proceedings, except such claims that may have been released with the consent of the Secretary. Upon such conveyance and assignment, the obligation of the mortgagee to pay the premium charges for insurance shall cease and the mortgagee shall be entitled to receive the benefits of the insurance as provided in this subsection, except that in such event the 1 per centum deduction, set out in (ii) hereof, shall not apply. Notwithstanding any other provision of this chapter, upon receipt, after September 2, 1964, of an application for insurance benefits on a mortgage insured under this chapter, the Secretary may terminate the mortgagee's obligation to pay premium charges on the mortgage.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(h) Certificate of claim; division of excess proceeds</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">The certificate of claim issued under this section shall be for an amount which the Secretary determines to be sufficient, when added to the face value of the debentures issued and the cash adjustment paid to the mortgagee, to equal the amount which the mortgagee would have received if, on the date of the assignment, transfer and delivery to the Secretary provided for in subsection (g), the mortgagor had extinguished the mortgage indebtedness by payment in full of all obligations under the mortgage and a reasonable amount for necessary expenses incurred by the mortgagee in connection with the foreclosure proceedings, or the acquisition of the mortgaged property otherwise, and the conveyance thereof to the Secretary. Each such certificate of claim shall provide that there shall accrue to the holder of such certificate with respect to the face amount of such certificate, an increment at the rate of 3 per centum per annum which shall not be compounded. If the net amount realized from the mortgage, and all claims in connection therewith, so assigned, transferred, and delivered, and from the property covered by such mortgage and all claims in connection with such property, after deducting all expenses incurred by the Secretary in handling, dealing with, acquiring title to, and disposing of such mortgage and property and in collecting such claims, exceeds the face value of the debentures issued and the cash adjustment paid to the mortgagee plus all interest paid on such debentures, such excess shall be divided as follows:</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(1) If such excess is greater than the total amount payable under the certificate of claim issued in connection with such property, the Secretary shall pay to the holder of such certificate the full amount so payable, and any excess remaining thereafter shall be retained by the Secretary and credited to the General Insurance Fund; and</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(2) If such excess is equal to or less than the total amount payable under such certificate of claim, the Secretary shall pay to the holder of such certificate the full amount of such excess.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(i) Debentures; execution; negotiability; terms; tax exemptions</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">Debentures issued under this section shall be executed in the name of the General Insurance Fund as obligor, shall be negotiable, and, if in book entry form, transferable, in the manner described by the Secretary in regulations, and shall be dated as of the date of default as determined in subsection (g) of this section, except that debentures issued pursuant to the provisions of section 1715k(f), section 1715l(g), and section 1715x of this title may be dated as of the date the mortgage is assigned (or the property is conveyed) to the Secretary and shall bear interest from such date. They shall bear interest at a rate established by the Secretary pursuant to section 1715o of this title payable semiannually on the 1st day of January and the 1st day of July of each year, and shall mature twenty years after the date thereof. Such debentures as are issued in exchange for mortgages insured after February 3, 1938, shall be exempt, both as to principal and interest, from all taxation (except surtaxes, estate, inheritance, and gift taxes) now or hereafter imposed by the United States, by any Territory, dependency, or possession thereof, or by any State, county, municipality, or local taxing authority. They shall be paid out of the General Insurance Fund which shall be primarily liable therefor, and they shall be fully and unconditionally guaranteed as to principal and interest by the United States, and, in the case of debentures issued in certificated registered form, such guaranty shall be expressed <!-- PDFPage:576 -->on the face of the debentures. In the event the General Insurance Fund fails to pay upon demand, when due, the principal of or interest on any debentures so guaranteed, the Secretary of the Treasury shall pay to the holders the amount thereof which is authorized to be appropriated out of any money in the Treasury not otherwise appropriated, and thereupon, to the extent of the amount so paid, the Secretary of the Treasury shall succeed to all the rights of the holders of such debentures.</p>

<p class="statutory-body">The Secretary is authorized either to (1) acquire possession of and title to any property, covered by a mortgage insured under this section and assigned to him, by voluntary conveyance in extinguishment of the mortgage indebtedness, or (2) institute proceedings for foreclosure on the property covered by any such insured mortgage and prosecute such proceedings to conclusion. The Secretary at any sale under foreclosure may, in his discretion, for the protection of the General Insurance Fund, bid any sum up to but not in excess of the total unpaid indebtedness secured by the mortgage, plus taxes, insurance, foreclosure costs, fees, and other expenses, and may become the purchaser of the property at such sale. In determining the amount to be bid, the Secretary shall act consistently with the goal established in section 1701z&ndash;11(a)(1) of this title. The Secretary is authorized to pay from the General Insurance Fund such sums as may be necessary to defray such taxes, insurance, costs, fees, and other expenses in connection with the acquisition or foreclosure of property under this section. Pending such acquisition by voluntary conveyance or by foreclosure, the Secretary is authorized, with respect to any mortgage assigned to him under the provisions of subsection (g), to exercise all the rights of a mortgagee under such mortgage, including the right to sell such mortgage, and to take such action and advance such sums as may be necessary to preserve or protect the lien of such mortgage.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(l) Handling and disposal of property; settlement of claims</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">Notwithstanding any other provisions of law relating to the acquisition, handling, or disposal of real and other property by the United States, the Secretary shall also have power, for the protection of the interests of the General Insurance Fund, to pay out of the General Insurance Fund all expenses or charges in connection with, and to deal with, complete, reconstruct, rent, renovate, modernize, insure, make contracts for the management of, or establish suitable agencies for the management of, or sell for cash or credit or lease in his discretion, any property acquired by him under this section, and notwithstanding any other provision of law, the Secretary shall also have power to pursue to final collection by way of compromise or otherwise all claims assigned and transferred to him in connection with the assignment, transfer, and delivery provided for in this section, and at any time, upon default, to foreclose on any property secured by any mortgage assigned and transferred to or held by him: <i>Provided</i>, That section 6101 of title 41 shall not be construed to apply to any contract for hazard insurance, or to any purchase or contract for services or supplies on account of such property if the amount thereof does not exceed $1,000.</p>

<p class="statutory-body">The Secretary, with the consent of the mortgagee and the mortgagor of a mortgage insured under this section prior to February 3, 1938, shall be empowered to reissue such mortgage insurance in accordance with the provisions of this section as amended by the National Housing Act Amendments of 1938, and any such insurance not so reissued shall not be affected by the enactment of such Act.</p>

<!-- field-end:head -->
<!-- field-start:statute -->
<p class="statutory-body">If the Secretary of Housing and Urban Development finds that, because of higher costs prevailing in Alaska, Guam, Hawaii, or the Virgin Islands, it is not feasible to construct dwellings or manufactured home courts or parks on property located in Alaska, Guam, Hawaii, or the Virgin Islands without sacrifice of sound standards of construction, design, or livability, within the limitations as to maximum or maxima mortgage amounts provided in this chapter, the Secretary may, by regulations or otherwise, prescribe, with respect to dollar amount, a higher maximum or maxima for the principal obligation of mortgages insured under this chapter covering property located in Alaska, Guam, Hawaii, or the Virgin Islands in such amounts as he shall find necessary to compensate for such higher costs but not to exceed, in any event, the maximum or maxima otherwise applicable (including increased mortgage amounts in geographical areas where cost levels so require) by more than one-half thereof. No mortgage with respect to a project or property in Alaska, Guam, Hawaii, or the Virgin Islands shall be accepted for insurance under this chapter unless the Secretary finds that the project or property is an acceptable risk giving consideration to the acute housing shortage in Alaska, Guam, Hawaii, or the Virgin Islands: <i>Provided</i>, That any such mortgage may be insured or accepted for insurance without regard to any requirement in any other section of this chapter that the Secretary find the project or property to be economically sound or an acceptable risk. Notwithstanding any of the provisions of this chapter or any other law, the Alaska Housing Authority or the Government of Guam, the Virgin Islands, or Hawaii or any agency or instrumentality thereof shall be eligible as mortgagor or mortgagee, as the case may be, for any of the purposes of mortgage insurance under the provisions of this chapter. Upon application by the mortgagee (1) where the mortgagor is regulated or restricted pursuant to the last sentence of this section or (2) where the Alaska Housing Authority or the Government of Guam, the Virgin Islands, or Hawaii or any agency or instrumentality thereof is the mortgagor or mortgagee, for the insurance of a mortgage under any provisions of this chapter, the Secretary is authorized to insure the mortgage (including advances thereon where otherwise authorized), and to make commitments for the insuring of any such mortgages prior to the date of their execution or disbursement thereon, under such provision (and this section) without regard to any requirement that the mortgagor shall have paid a prescribed amount on account of such property. Without limiting the authority of the Secretary under any other provision of law, the Secretary is authorized, with respect to any mortgagor in such case (except where the Alaska Housing Authority is the mortgagor or mortgagee), to require the mortgagor to be regulated or restricted as to rents or sales, charges, capital structure, rate of return, and methods of operation to such an extent and in such manner as the Secretary determines advisable to provide reasonable rentals and sales prices and a reasonable return on the investment.</p>

<h4 class="subsection-head">(h) Failure to sell to a nonprofit organization</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">In the event that a mortgagor of the character described in paragraph (3) of subsection (a) obtains an insured mortgage loan pursuant to this section and fails to sell the property or project covered by such mortgage to a nonprofit housing corporation or nonprofit housing trust of the character described in paragraph (1) of subsection (a), the Secretary is authorized to refuse, for such period of time as he shall deem appropriate under the circumstances, to insure under this section any additional investor-sponsor type mortgage loans made to such mortgagor or to any other investor-sponsor mortgagor where, in the determination of the Secretary, any of its stockholders were identified with such mortgagor.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(i) Mortgages executed by consumer cooperatives covering existing structures</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">Nothing in this chapter shall be construed to prevent the insurance of a mortgage executed by a mortgagor of the character described in paragraph (1) of subsection (a) of this section covering property upon which dwelling units and related facilities have been constructed prior to the filing of the application for mortgage insurance hereunder: <i>Provided</i>, That the Secretary determines that the consumer interest is protected and that the mortgagor will be a consumer cooperative. In the case of properties other than new construction, the limitations in this section upon the amount of the mortgage shall be based upon the appraised value of the property for continued use as a cooperative rather than upon the Secretary's estimate of the replacement cost. As to any project on which construction was commenced after September 23, 1959, the mortgage on such project shall be eligible for insurance under this section only in those cases where the construction was subject to inspection by the Secretary and where there was compliance with the provisions of section 1715c of this title. As to any project on which construction was commenced prior to September 23, 1959, such inspection, and compliance with the provisions of section 1715c of this title, shall not be a prerequisite.</p>

<p class="statutory-body">(1) With respect to any property covered by a mortgage insured under this section (or any cooperative housing project covered by a mortgage <!-- PDFPage:588 -->insured under section 1713 of this title as in effect prior to April 20, 1950), the Secretary is authorized, upon such terms and conditions as he may prescribe, to make commitments to insure and to insure supplementary cooperative loans (including advances during construction or improvement) made by financial institutions approved by the Secretary. The Secretary is further authorized to make commitments to insure and to insure supplementary cooperative loans (including advances during construction or improvement) with respect to any property purchased from the Federal Government by a nonprofit corporation or trust of the character described in paragraph (1) of subsection (a), if the property is covered by an uninsured mortgage representing a part of the purchase price.

<p class="statutory-body">(2) To be eligible for insurance under this subsection, a supplementary cooperative loan shall&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(A) be limited to an amount which, when added to the outstanding mortgage indebtedness on the property, creates a total outstanding indebtedness which does not exceed the original principal obligation of the mortgage; except that, in the case of improvements or additional community facilities, the outstanding indebtedness may be increased by an amount equal to 97 per centum of the amount which the Secretary estimates will be the value of such improvements or facilities, and the new outstanding indebtedness may exceed the original principal obligation of the mortgage if such new outstanding indebtedness does not exceed the limitations imposed by subsection (b);</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(B) have a maturity satisfactory to the Secretary but not to exceed the remaining term of the mortgage; except that, in the case of repairs or improvements to a property covered by an uninsured mortgage dated more than twenty years prior to the date of the commitment to insure, of such magnitude that the Secretary deems them to be a major rehabilitation or modernization of such property, the loan may have a maturity date up to ten years in excess of the remaining term of the uninsured mortgage;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(C) be secured in such manner as the Secretary may require;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(D) contain such other terms, conditions, and restrictions as the Secretary may prescribe; and</p>

Upon termination of the insurance obligation of the Management Fund by payment of any mortgage or loan insured under this section, and at such time or times prior to such termination as the Secretary may determine, the Secretary is authorized to distribute to the mortgagor or borrower a share of the Participating Reserve Account in such manner and amount as the Secretary shall determine to be equitable and in accordance with sound actuarial and accounting practice: <i>Provided</i>, That in no event shall the amount of the distributable share exceed the aggregate scheduled annual premiums of the mortgagor or borrower to the year of payment of the share less the total amount of any share or shares previously distributed by the Secretary to the mortgagor or borrower: <i>And provided further</i>, That in no event may a distributable share be distributed until any funds transferred from the General Insurance Fund to the Management Fund pursuant to subsection (o) have been repaid in full to the General Insurance Fund. No mortgagor, mortgagee, borrower, or lender shall have any vested right in a credit balance in any <!-- PDFPage:589 -->such account or be subject to any liability arising out of the mutuality of the Management Fund. The determination of the Secretary as to the amount to be paid by him to any mortgagor or borrower shall be final and conclusive.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(m) Transfer of insurance to Management Fund</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">The Secretary is authorized to transfer to the Management Fund commitments for insurance issued under subsections (a)(1), (i), and (j) prior to August 10, 1965, and to transfer to the Management Fund the insurance of any mortgage or loan insured prior to August 10, 1965, under subsection (a)(1), (a)(3) (if the project is acquired by a cooperative corporation), (i), or (j): <i>Provided</i>, That the insurance of any mortgage or loan shall not be transferred under the provisions of this subsection if on August 10, 1965, the mortgage or loan is in default and the mortgagee or lender has notified the Secretary in writing of its intention to file an insurance claim. Any insurance or commitment not so transferred shall continue to be an obligation of the General Insurance Fund.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(n) Payment of premium charges in debentures</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">Notwithstanding the limitations contained in other provisions of this chapter, premium charges for mortgages or loans the insurance of which is the obligation of either the Management Fund or the General Insurance Fund may be payable in debentures issued in connection with mortgages or loans transferred to the Management Fund or in connection with mortgages or loans insured pursuant to commitments transferred to the Management Fund, as provided in subsection (m) of this section. Premium charges on the insurance of mortgages or loans transferred to the Management Fund or insured pursuant to commitments transferred to the Management Fund may be payable in debentures which are the obligation of either the Management Fund or the General Insurance Fund.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(o) Transfer of funds between Management Fund and General Insurance Fund; investment of monies</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">Notwithstanding any other provision of this chapter the Secretary is authorized to transfer funds between the Cooperative Management Housing Insurance Fund and the General Insurance Fund in such amounts and at such times as he may determine, taking into consideration the requirements of each such Fund, to assist in carrying out effectively the insurance programs for which such Funds were respectively established. Moneys in the Cooperative Management Housing Insurance Fund not needed for current operations of the fund shall be deposited with the Treasurer of the United States to the credit of the Cooperative Management Housing Insurance Fund or invested in bonds or other obligations of, or in bonds or other obligations guaranteed as to principal and interest by, the United States or any agency of the United States: <i>Provided</i>, That such moneys shall to the maximum extent feasible be invested in such bonds or other obligations the proceeds of which will be used to directly support the residential mortgage market. The Secretary may, with the approval of the Secretary of the Treasury, purchase in the open market debentures which are the obligations of the Cooperative Management Housing Insurance Fund. Such purchases shall be made at a price which will provide an investment yield of not less than the yield obtainable from other investments authorized by this subsection. Debentures so purchased shall be canceled and not reissued.</p>

<p class="statutory-body">Notwithstanding any other provision of this section, the project mortgage amounts which may be insured under this section may be increased by up to 20 per centum if such increase is necessary to account for the increased cost of the project due to the installation therein of a solar energy system (as defined in subparagraph (3) of the last paragraph of section 1703(a) of this title) or residential energy conservation measures (as defined in section 8211(11)(A) through (G) and (I) of title 42)&#160;<sup><a href="#1715e_1_target" name="1715e_1">1</a></sup> in cases where the Secretary determines that such measures are in addition to those required under the minimum property standards and will be cost-effective over the life of the measure.</p>

<p class="statutory-body-1em">(3) as to mortgages meeting the requirements of this section which are insured or initially endorsed for insurance on or after June 30, 1961, notwithstanding the provisions of paragraphs (1) and (2) of this subsection, the Secretary in his discretion, in accordance with such regulations as he may prescribe, may make payments pursuant to such paragraphs in cash or in debentures (as provided in the mortgage insurance contract), or may acquire a mortgage loan that is in default and the security therefor upon payment to the mortgagee in cash or in debentures (as provided in the mortgage insurance contract) of a total amount equal to the unpaid principal balance of the loan plus any accrued interest and any advances approved by the Secretary and made previously by the mortgagee under the provisions of the mortgage, and after the acquisition of any such mortgage by the Secretary the mortgagee shall have no further rights, liabilities, or obligations with respect to the loan or the security for the loan. The appropriate provisions of sections 1710 and 1713 of this title relating to the issuance of debentures shall apply with respect to debentures issued under this paragraph, and the appropriate provisions of sections 1710 and 1713 of this title relating to the rights, liabilities, and obligations of a mortgagee shall apply with respect to the Secretary when he has acquired an insured mortgage under this paragraph, in accordance with and subject to regulations (modifying such provisions to the extent necessary to render their application for such purposes appropriate and effective) which shall be prescribed by the Secretary, except that as applied to mortgages so acquired (A) all references in section 1710 of this title to the Mutual Mortgage Insurance Fund or the Fund shall be construed to refer to the General Insurance Fund, and (B) all references in section 1710 of this title to section 1709 of this title shall be construed to refer to this section. If the insurance is paid in cash, there shall be added to such payment an amount equivalent to the interest which the debentures would have earned, computed to a date to be established pursuant to regulations issued by the Secretary.</p>

Upon such assignment, transfer, and delivery the obligation of the mortgagee to pay the premium charges for insurance shall cease, and the Secretary shall issue to the mortgagee debentures having a par value equal to the amount of the original principal obligation of the mortgage which was unpaid on the date of the assignment, plus accrued interest to such date. Debentures issued pursuant to this paragraph shall be issued in the same manner and subject to the same terms and conditions as debentures issued under paragraph (1) of this subsection, except that the debentures issued pursuant to this paragraph shall be dated as of the date the mortgage is assigned to the Secretary, shall mature ten years after such date, and shall bear interest from such date at the going Federal rate determined at the time of issuance. The term &quot;going Federal rate&quot; as used herein means the annual rate of interest which the Secretary of the Treasury shall specify as applicable to the six-month period (consisting of January through June or July through December) which includes the issuance date of such debentures, which applicable rate for each such six-month period shall be determined by the Secretary of the Treasury by estimating the average yield to maturity, on the basis of daily closing market bid quotations or prices during the month of May or the month of November, as the case may be, next preceding such six-month period, on all outstanding marketable obligations of the United States having a maturity date of eight to twelve years from the first day of such month of May or November (or, if no such obligations are outstanding, the obligation next shorter than eight years and the obligation next longer than twelve years, respectively, shall be used), and by adjusting such estimated average annual yield to the nearest one-eight of 1 per centum.

Upon the assignment, transfer, and delivery of the credit instrument and the mortgage to the Association, the mortgage insurance contract shall terminate and the mortgagee shall receive insurance benefits as provided in subparagraph (A). The Association is authorized to accept such loan documents in its own name and to hold, service, and sell such loans as agent for the Secretary. The mortgagor's obligation to pay a service charge in lieu of a mortgage insurance premium shall continue as long as the mortgage is held by the Association or by the Secretary. The Secretary shall have the same authority with respect to mortgages assigned to the Secretary or the Association under this subparagraph as provided by section 1715n(c) of this title.</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(C)(i) In lieu of accepting assignment of the original credit instrument and the mortgage securing the credit instrument under subparagraph (A) in exchange for receipt of debentures, the Secretary shall arrange for the sale of the beneficial interests in the mortgage loan through an auction and sale of the (I) mortgage loans, or (II) participation certificates, or other mortgage-backed obligations in a form acceptable to the Secretary (in this subparagraph referred to as &quot;participation certificates&quot;).

<p class="statutory-body-1em">(II) A mortgagee who elects to assign a mortgage shall provide the Secretary and persons bidding at the auction a description of the characteristics of the original credit instrument and mortgage securing the original credit instrument, which shall include the principal mortgage balance, original stated interest rate, service fees, real estate and tenant characteristics, the level and duration of applicable Federal subsidies, and any other information determined by the Secretary to be appropriate. The Secretary shall also provide information regarding the status of the property with respect to the provisions of the Emergency Low Income Housing Preservation Act of 1987 or any subsequent Act with respect to eligibility to prepay the mortgage, a statement of whether the owner has filed a notice of intent to prepay or a plan of action under the Emergency Low Income Housing Preservation Act of 1987 or any subsequent Act, and the details with respect to incentives provided under the Emergency Low Income Housing Preservation Act of 1987 or any subsequent Act in lieu of exercising prepayment rights.</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(III) The Secretary shall, upon receipt of the information in subclause (II), promptly advertise for an auction and publish such mortgage descriptions in advance of the auction.

<p class="statutory-body-1em">(IV) In any auction under this subparagraph, the Secretary shall accept the lowest interest rate bid for purchase that the Secretary determines to be acceptable. The Secretary shall cause the accepted bid to be published in the Federal Register. Settlement for the sale of the credit instrument and the mortgage securing the credit instrument shall occur not later than 30 business days after the date winning bidders are selected in the auction, unless the Secretary determines that extraordinary circumstances require an extension (not to exceed 60 days) of the period.</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(V) If no bids are received, the bids that are received are not acceptable to the Secretary, or settlement does not occur within the period under subclause (IV), the mortgagee shall retain all rights (including the right to interest, at a rate to be determined by the Secretary, for the period covering any actions taken under this subparagraph) under this section to assign the mortgage loan to the Secretary.</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(iii) As part of the auction process, the Secretary shall agree to provide a monthly interest subsidy payment from the General Insurance Fund to the purchaser under the auction of the original credit instrument or the mortgage securing the credit instrument (and any subsequent holders or assigns who are approved mortgagees). The subsidy payment shall be paid on the first day of each month in an amount equal to the difference between the stated interest due on the mortgage loan and the lowest interest rate necessary to accomplish a sale of the mortgage loan or participation certificates (less the servicing fee, if appropriate) for the then unpaid principal balance plus accrued interest at a rate determined by the Secretary. Each interest subsidy payment shall be treated by the holder of the mortgage as interest paid on the mortgage. The interest subsidy payment shall be provided until the earlier of&mdash;</p>

<h4 class="note-head">&quot;subtitle a&mdash;general provisions</h4>
<h4 class="note-sub-head">&quot;SEC. 201. SHORT TITLE.</h4>
<p class="note-body">&quot;This title [amending sections 1715z&ndash;6 and 1715z&ndash;15 of this title and sections 1437f, 1472, 1485, and 1487 of Title 42, The Public Health and Welfare] may be cited as the &apos;Emergency Low Income Housing Preservation Act of 1987&apos;.</p>
<h4 class="note-sub-head">&quot;SEC. 202. FINDINGS AND PURPOSE.</h4>
<p class="note-body">&quot;(a) <cap-smallcap>Findings</cap-smallcap>.&mdash;The Congress finds that&mdash;</p>
<p class="note-body-1em">&quot;(1) in the next 15 years, more than 330,000 low income housing units insured or assisted under sections 221(d)(3) and 236 of the National Housing Act [12 U.S.C. 1715l(d)(3), 1715z&ndash;1] could be lost as a result of the termination of low income affordability restrictions;</p>
<p class="note-body-1em">&quot;(2) in the next decade, more than 465,000 low income housing units produced with assistance under section 8 of the United States Housing Act of 1937 [42 U.S.C. 1437f] could be lost as a result of the expiration of the rental assistance contracts;</p>
<p class="note-body-1em">&quot;(3) some 150,000 units of rural low income housing financed under section 515 of the Housing Act of 1949 [42 U.S.C. 1485] are threatened with loss as a result of the prepayment of mortgages by owners;</p>
<!-- PDFPage:621 --><p class="note-body-1em">&quot;(4) the loss of this privately owned and federally assisted housing, which would occur in a period of sharply rising rents on unassisted housing and extremely low production of additional low rent housing, would inflict unacceptable harm on current tenants and would precipitate a grave national crisis in the supply of low income housing that was neither anticipated nor intended when contracts for these units were entered into;</p>
<p class="note-body-1em">&quot;(5) the loss of this affordable housing, to encourage the production of which the public has provided substantial benefits over past years, would irreparably damage hard-won progress toward such important and long-established national objectives as&mdash;</p>
<p class="note-body-2em">&quot;(A) providing a more adequate supply of decent, safe, and sanitary housing that is affordable to low income Americans;</p>
<p class="note-body-2em">&quot;(B) increasing the supply of housing affordable to low income Americans that is accessible to employment opportunities; and</p>
<p class="note-body-2em">&quot;(C) expanding housing opportunities for all Americans, particularly members of disadvantaged minorities;</p>
<p class="note-body-1em">&quot;(6) the provision of an adequate supply of low income housing has depended and will continue to depend upon a strong, long-term partnership between the public and private sectors that accommodates a fair return on investment;</p>
<p class="note-body-1em">&quot;(7) recent reductions in Federal housing assistance and tax benefits related to low income housing have increased the incentives for private industry to withdraw from the production and management of low income housing;</p>
<p class="note-body-1em">&quot;(8) efforts to retain this housing must take account of specific financial and market conditions that differ markedly from project to project;</p>
<p class="note-body-1em">&quot;(9) a major review of alternative responses to this threatened loss of affordable housing is now being undertaken by numerous private sector task forces as well as State and local organizations; and</p>
<p class="note-body-1em">&quot;(10) until the Congress can act on recommendations that will emerge from this review, interim measures are needed to avoid the irreplaceable loss of low income housing and irrevocable displacement of current tenants.</p>
<p class="note-body">&quot;(b) <cap-smallcap>Purpose</cap-smallcap>.&mdash;It is the purpose of this title&mdash;</p>
<p class="note-body-1em">&quot;(1) to preserve and retain to the maximum extent practicable as housing affordable to low income families or persons those privately owned dwelling units that were produced for such purpose with Federal assistance;</p>
<p class="note-body-1em">&quot;(2) to minimize the involuntary displacement of tenants currently residing in such housing; and</p>
<p class="note-body-1em">&quot;(3) to continue the partnership between all levels of government and the private sector in the production and operation of housing that is affordable to low income Americans.</p>
<h4 class="note-sub-head">&quot;SEC. 203. TERMINATION OF CERTAIN PROVISIONS.</h4>

<h4 class="subsection-head">(c) Insurance of certain assigned mortgages</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">The Secretary shall also have authority to insure under this chapter any mortgage assigned to the Secretary in connection with payment under a contract of mortgage insurance or executed in connection with the sale by the Secretary, including a sale through another entity acting under authority of the fourth sentence of section 1710(g) of this title, of any property acquired under any section or subchapter of this chapter without regard to any limitations or requirements contained in this chapter upon the eligibility of the mortgage, upon the payment of insurance premiums, or upon the terms and conditions of insurance settlement and the benefits of the insurance to be included in such settlement.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(d) Insurance of loans made to cover operating losses of certain projects having existing mortgages insured by Secretary</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">(1) Notwithstanding any other provision of this chapter, the Secretary is authorized to insure loans made to cover the operating losses of certain projects that have existing project mortgages insured by the Secretary. Insurance under this subsection shall be in the Secretary's discretion and upon such terms and conditions as the Secretary may prescribe, and shall be provided in accordance with the provisions of this subsection. For purposes of this subsection, the term &quot;operating loss&quot; means the amount by which the sum of the taxes, interest on the mortgage debt, mortgage insurance premiums, hazard insurance premiums, and the expense of maintenance and operation of the project covered by the mortgage, exceeds the income of the project.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(2) To be eligible for insurance pursuant to this paragraph&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(A) the existing project mortgage (i) shall have been insured by the Secretary at any time before or after February 5, 1988; and (ii) shall cover any property, other than a property upon which there is located a 1- to 4-family dwelling;</p>

<!-- PDFPage:627 --><p class="statutory-body-1em">(C) the loan shall be made within 10 years after the end of the period of consecutive months referred to in the preceding subparagraph; and</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(D) the project shall meet all applicable underwriting and other requirements of the Secretary at the time the loan is to be made.</p>
<br class="Q04" />
<p class="statutory-body">(4) Any loan insured pursuant to this subsection shall (A) bear interest at such rate as may be agreed upon by the mortgagor and mortgagee; (B) be secured in such manner as the Secretary shall require; (C) be limited to a term not exceeding the unexpired term of the original mortgage; and (D) be insured under the same section as the original mortgage.

The Secretary is authorized to collect a premium charge for insurance of loans pursuant to this subsection in an amount computed at the same premium rate as is applicable to the original mortgage. This premium shall be payable in cash or in debentures of the insurance fund under which the loan is insured at par plus accrued interest. In the event of a failure of the borrower to make any payment due under such loan or under the original mortgage, both the loan and original mortgage shall be considered in default, and if such default continues for a period of thirty days, the lender shall be entitled to insurance benefits, computed in the same manner as for the original mortgage, except that in determining the interest rate under section 1715o of this title for the debentures representing the portion of the claim applicable to the loan, the date of the commitment to insure the loan and the insurance date of the loan shall be taken into consideration rather than the commitment or insurance date for the original mortgage.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(5) A loan involving a project covered by a mortgage insured under section 1715e of this title that is the obligation of the Cooperative Management Housing Insurance Fund shall be the obligation of such fund, and loans involving projects covered by a mortgage insured under section 1715z&ndash;1 of this title or under any section of this subchapter pursuant to subsection (e) of this section shall be the obligation of the Special Risk Insurance Fund.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(6) In determining the amount of an operating loss loan to be insured pursuant to this subsection, the Secretary shall not reduce such amount solely to reflect any amounts placed in escrow (at the time the existing project mortgage was insured) for initial operating deficits. If an operating loss loan was insured by the Secretary pursuant to this subsection before October 28, 1992, and was reduced solely to reflect the amount placed in escrow for initial operating deficits, the Secretary shall insure, to the extent of the availability of insurance authority provided in appropriation Acts, an increase in the existing loan or a separate loan, in an amount equal to the lesser of (A) the maximum amount permitted under this subsection and the applicable underwriting requirements established by the Secretary and in effect at the time the loan is to be made, or (B) the amount of the escrow for initial operating deficits.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(e) Insurance of mortgages executed in connection with repair, rehabilitation, construction, or purchase of property in older, declining urban areas</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">Notwithstanding any of the provisions of this chapter except section 1715c of this title, and without regard to limitations upon eligibility contained in any section of this subchapter or subchapter IX&ndash;B, other than the limitation in section 1709(g) of this title, the Secretary is authorized, upon application by the mortgagee, to insure under any section of this subchapter or subchapter IX&ndash;B a mortgage executed in connection with the repair, rehabilitation, construction, or purchase of property located in an older, declining urban area in which the conditions are such that one or more of the eligibility requirements applicable to the section or subchapter under which insurance is sought could not be met, if the Secretary finds that (1) the area is reasonably viable, giving consideration to the need for providing adequate housing or group practice facilities for families of low and moderate income in such area, and (2) the property is an acceptable risk in view of such consideration. The insurance of a mortgage pursuant to this subsection shall be the obligation of the Special Risk Insurance Fund.</p>

<p class="statutory-body">(2) In the case of the purchase or refinancing under this subsection of a multifamily housing project located in an older, declining urban area, the Secretary shall make available an amount not to exceed $30,000,000 of available purchase authority pursuant to section 1720&#160;<sup><a href="#1715n_1_target" name="1715n_1">1</a></sup> of this title to reduce interest rates on low- and moderate-income rental housing in projects having 100 units or less which otherwise could not support refinancing and moderate rehabilitation without causing excessive rent burdens on current tenants due to rent increases. The Secretary shall prescribe such terms and conditions as he deems necessary to assure that&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(A) the refinancing is used to lower the monthly debt service only to the extent necessary to assure the continued economic viability of the project, taking into account any rent reductions to be implemented by the mortgagor; and</p>
<!-- PDFPage:628 --><p class="statutory-body-1em">(B) during the mortgage term no rental increases shall be made except those which are necessary to offset actual and reasonable operating expense increases or other necessary expense increases and maintain reasonable profit levels approved by the Secretary.</p>
<br class="Q04" />
<p class="statutory-body">(3) For all insurance authorized by this subsection and provided pursuant to a commitment entered into after October 8, 1980, the Secretary may not accept an offer to prepay or request refinancing of a mortgage secured by rental housing unless the Secretary takes appropriate action that will obligate the borrower (and successors in interest thereof) to utilize the property as a rental property for a period of five years from the date on which the insurance was provided (twenty years in the case of any such mortgage purchased under section 1720&#160;<sup><a href="#1715n_1_target" name="1715n_1">1</a></sup> of this title) unless the Secretary finds that&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(A) the conversion of the property to a cooperative, or condominium form of ownership is sponsored by a bona fide tenants&apos; organization representing a majority of the households in the project;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(B) continuance of the property as rental housing is clearly unnecessary to assure adequate rental housing opportunities for low- and moderate-income people in the community; or</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(C) continuance of the property as rental housing would have an undesirable and deleterious effect on the surrounding neighborhood.</p>
<br class="Q04" />
<p class="statutory-body">(4) In the case of refinancing of an existing hospital (or existing nursing home, existing assisted living facility, existing intermediate care facility, existing board and care home, or any combination thereof) the Secretary shall prescribe such terms and conditions as the Secretary deems necessary to assure that&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(A) the refinancing is employed to lower the monthly debt service costs (taking into account any fees or charges connected with such refinancing) of such existing hospital (or existing nursing home, existing assisted living facility, existing intermediate care facility, existing board and care home, or any combination thereof);</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(B) the proceeds of any refinancing will be employed only to retire the existing indebtedness and pay the necessary cost of refinancing on such existing hospital (or existing nursing home, existing assisted living facility, existing intermediate care facility, existing board and care home, or any combination thereof);</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(C) such existing hospital (or existing nursing home, existing assisted living facility, existing intermediate care facility, existing board and care home, or any combination thereof) is economically viable; and</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(D) the applicable requirements for certificates, studies, and statements of section 1715w of this title (for the existing nursing home, existing assisted living facility, intermediate care facility, board and care home, or any combination thereof, proposed to be refinanced) or of section 1715z&ndash;7 of this title (for the existing hospital proposed to be refinanced) have been met.</p>
<br class="Q04" />
<p class="statutory-body">(5) In the case of any purchase or refinancing under this subsection involving property to be rehabilitated or developed under section 1437o&#160;<sup><a href="#1715n_1_target" name="1715n_1">1</a></sup> of title 42, the Secretary may&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(A) include rehabilitation or development costs of not to exceed $20,000 per unit, except that the Secretary may increase such amount by not to exceed 25 per centum for specific properties where cost levels so require;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(B) permit subordinated liens securing up to the full amount of mortgage financing provided by State or local governments or agencies thereof; and</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(C) pay such benefits in cash unless the mortgagee submits a written request for debenture payment.</p>

<p class="statutory-body-1em">(4)(A) With respect to nursing homes and intermediate care facilities and combined nursing home and intermediate care facilities, the Secretary shall not insure any mortgage under this section unless he has received, from the State agency designated in accordance with section 604(a)(1) or section 1521&#160;<sup><a href="#1715w_3_target" name="1715w_3">3</a></sup> of the Public Health Service Act [42 U.S.C. 291d (a)(1), 300m] for the State in which is located the nursing home or intermediate care facility or combined nursing home and intermediate care facility covered by the mortgage, a certification that (i) there is a need for such home or facility or combined home and facility, and (ii) there are in force in such State or in the municipality or other political subdivision of the State in which the proposed home or facility or combined home and facility is to be located reasonable minimum standards of licensure and methods of operation governing it. No such mortgage shall be insured under this section unless the Secretary has received such assurance as he may deem satisfactory from the State agency that such standards will be applied and enforced with respect to any home or facility or combined home and facility located in the State for which mortgage insurance is provided under this section. If no such State agency exists, or if the State agency exists but is not empowered to provide a certification that there is a need for the home or facility or combined home and facility as required in clause (i) of the first sentence, the Secretary shall not insure any mortgage under this section unless (i) the State in which the home or facility or combined home and facility is located has conducted or commissioned and paid for the preparation of an independent study of market need and feasibility that (I) is prepared in accordance with the principles established by the American Institute of Certified Public Accountants; (II) assesses, on a marketwide basis, the impact of the proposed home or facility or combined home and facility on, and its relationship to, other health care facilities and services, the percentage of excess beds, demographic projections, alternative health care delivery systems, and the reimbursement structure of the home, facility, or combined home and facility; (III) is addressed to and is acceptable to the Secretary in form and substance; and (IV) in the event the State does not prepare the study, is prepared by a financial consultant who is selected by the State or the applicant for mortgage insurance and is approved by the Secretary; and (ii) the State complies with the other provisions of this subparagraph that would otherwise be required to be met by a State agency designated in accordance with section 604(a)(1) or section 1521&#160;<sup><a href="#1715w_3_target" name="1715w_3">3</a></sup> of the Public Health Service Act.

<h4 class="subsection-head">(a) Purpose; authorization</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">(1) In order to assist in lowering housing costs and improving housing standards, quality, livability, or durability or neighborhood design through the utilization of advanced housing technology, or experimental property standards, the Secretary is authorized to insure and to make commitments to insure, under this section, mortgages (including home improvement loans, and including advances on mortgages during construction) secured by properties including dwellings involving the utilization and testing of advanced technology in housing design, materials, or construction, or experimental property standards for neighborhood design if the Secretary determines that (A) the property is an acceptable risk, giving consideration to the need for testing advanced housing technology or experimental property standards, (B) the utilization and testing of the advanced technology or experimental property standards involved will provide data or experience which the Secretary deems to be significant in reducing housing costs or improving housing standards, quality, livability, or durability, or improving neighborhood design, and (C) the mortgages are eligible for insurance under the provisions of this section and under any further terms and conditions which may be prescribed by the Secretary to establish the acceptability of the mortgages for insurance.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(2) The Secretary is further authorized to insure and to make commitments to insure, under this section, mortgages (including advances on mortgages during construction) secured by properties in projects to be carried out in accordance with plans approved by the Secretary under section 1701z of this title.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(b) Eligibility for insurance; conditions; limits</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">To be eligible for insurance under this section, a mortgage shall meet the requirements of one of the other sections or subchapters of this chapter; except that, in lieu of determining the appraised value or the replacement cost of the property in cases involving new construction or the estimated cost of repair and rehabilitation or improvement in cases involving existing properties, the Secretary shall estimate the cost of replacing the property using comparable conventional design, materials, and construction, and any limitation upon the maximum mortgage amount available to a nonoccupant owner shall not, in the discretion of the Secretary, be applicable to mortgages insured under this section.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(c) Contracts, agreements, and financial undertakings with mortgagor</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">The Secretary may enter into such contracts, agreements, and financial undertakings with the mortgagor and others as he deems necessary or desirable to carry out the purposes of this section, and may expend available funds for such <!-- PDFPage:649 -->purposes, including the correction (when he determines it necessary to protect the occupants), at any time subsequent to insurance of a mortgage, of defects or failures in the dwellings which the Secretary finds are caused by or related to the advanced housing technology utilized in their design or construction or experimental property standards. Any authority which the Secretary may exercise in connection with a mortgage, or property covered by a mortgage, insured under any other section of this subchapter (including payments to reduce rentals for, or to facilitate homeownership by, lower income families) may be exercised in connection with a mortgage, or property covered by a mortgage, meeting the requirements of such other section (except as specified in subsection (b)), which is insured under this section to the same extent and in the same manner as if the mortgage insured under this section was insured under such other section.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(d) Investigations and analysis of data; publication and distribution of reports</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">The Secretary may make such investigations and analyses of data, and publish and distribute such reports, as he determines to be necessary or desirable to assure the most beneficial use of the data and information to be acquired as a result of this section.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(e) Entitlement to insurance benefits</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">Any mortgagee or lender under a mortgage insured under subsection (b) shall be entitled to insurance benefits determined in the same manner as such benefits would be determined if such mortgage or loan were insured under the section or subchapter of this chapter for which it otherwise would have been eligible except for the experimental feature of the property involved.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(f) Defaults; payment in cash or debentures; acquisition of mortgage</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">Notwithstanding the provisions of subsection (e) of this section, in the case of default on any mortgage insured under this section, the Secretary in his discretion, in accordance with such regulations as he may prescribe, may make payments pursuant to such subsections in cash or in debentures (as provided in the mortgage insurance contract), or may acquire the mortgage loan and the security therefor upon payment to the mortgagee in cash or in debentures (as provided in the mortgage insurance contract) of a total amount equal to the unpaid principal balance of the loan plus any accrued interest and any advances approved by the Secretary made previously by the mortgagee under the provisions of the mortgage. After the acquisition of the mortgage by the Secretary the mortgagee shall have no further rights, liabilities, or obligations with respect to the mortgage. The appropriate provisions of sections 1710 and 1713 of this title relating to the issuance of debentures shall apply with respect to debentures issued under this subsection, and the appropriate provisions of sections 1710 and 1713 of this title relating to the rights, liabilities, and obligations of a mortgagee shall apply with respect to the Secretary when he has acquired an insured mortgage under this subsection, in accordance with and subject to regulations (modifying such provisions to the extent necessary to render their application for such purposes appropriate and effective) which shall be prescribed by the Secretary, except that as applied to mortgages insured under this section (1) all references in section 1710 of this title to the Mutual Mortgage Insurance Fund or the Fund shall be construed to refer to the General Insurance Fund, and (2) all references in section 1710 of this title to section 1709 of this title shall be construed to refer to this section. If the insurance payment is made in cash, there shall be added to such payment an amount equivalent to the interest which the debentures would have earned, computed to a date to be established pursuant to regulations issued by the Secretary.</p>

<p class="statutory-body">The Secretary is authorized, in his discretion and under such terms and conditions as he may prescribe (including the minimum number of family units in the project which shall be offered for sale and provisions for the protection of the consumer and the public interest), to insure any mortgage covering a one-family unit in a multifamily project and an undivided interest in the common areas and facilities which serve the project, if (1) the mortgage meets the requirements of this subsection and of section 1709(b) of this title, except as that section is modified by this subsection, (2) at least 80 percent of the units in the project covered by mortgages insured under this subchapter are occupied by the mortgagors or comortgagors, and (3) the project has a blanket mortgage insured by the Secretary under subsection (d). Any project proposed to be constructed or rehabilitated after June 30, 1961, with the assistance of mortgage insurance under this chapter, where the sale of family units is to be assisted with mortgage insurance under this subsection, shall be subject to such requirements as the Secretary may prescribe. To be eligible for insurance pursuant to this subsection, a mortgage shall (A) involve a principal obligation in an amount not to exceed the maximum principal obligation of a mortgage which may be insured in the area pursuant to section 1709(b)(2) of this title or pursuant to section 1709(h) of this title under the conditions described in section 1709(h) of this title, and (B) have a maturity satisfactory to the Secretary, but not to exceed, in any event, thirty-five years from the date of the beginning of amortization of the mortgage. The mortgage shall contain such provisions as the Secretary determines to be necessary for the maintenance of common areas and facilities and the multifamily project. The mortgagor shall have exclusive right to the use of the one-family unit covered by the mortgage and, together with the owners of other units in the multifamily project, shall have the right to the use of the common areas and facilities serving the project and the obligation of maintaining all such common areas and facilities. The Secretary may require that the rights and obligations of the mortgagor and the owners of other dwelling units in the project shall be subject to such controls as he determines to be necessary and feasible to promote and protect individual owners, the multifamily project, and its occupants. For the purposes of this subsection, the Secretary is authorized in his discretion and under such terms and conditions as he may prescribe to permit one-family units and interests in common areas and facilities in multifamily projects covered by mortgages insured under any section of this chapter (other than section 1715e(a)(1) and (2) of this title) to be released from the liens of those mortgages.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(d) Blanket mortgages of multifamily projects; plan of family unit ownership; regulations; stock purchase and redemption</h4>

<p class="statutory-body-1em">(1) has certified to the Secretary, as a condition of obtaining the insurance of a blanket mortgage under this subsection, that upon completion of the multifamily project covered by such mortgage it intends to commit the ownership of the multifamily project to a plan of family unit ownership under which each family unit would be eligible for individual mortgage insurance under subsection (c) and will faithfully and diligently make and carry out all reasonable efforts to establish such plan of family unit ownership and to sell such family units to purchasers approved by the Secretary; and</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(2) may, in the Secretary's discretion, be regulated or restricted as to rents, charges, capital structure, rate of return, and methods of operation until the termination of all obligations of the Secretary under the insurance and during such further period of time as the Secretary shall be the owner, holder or reinsurer of the mortgage. The Secretary may make such contracts with and acquire for not to exceed $100 such stock or interest in such mortgagor as he may deem necessary to render effective any such regulation or restriction of such mortgagor. The stock or interest acquired by the Secretary shall be paid for out of the General Insurance Fund, and shall be redeemed by the mortgagor at par at any time upon the request of the Secretary after the termination of all obligations of the Secretary under the insurance.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(e) Eligibility for insurance of blanket mortgages of multifamily projects</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">To be eligible for insurance, a blanket mortgage on any multifamily project of a mortgagor of the character described in subsection (d) shall involve a principal obligation in an amount&mdash;</p>

<p class="statutory-body">Any blanket mortgage insured under subsection (d) shall provide for complete amortization by periodic payments within such terms as the Secretary may prescribe but not to exceed 40 years from the beginning of amortization of the mortgage, and shall bear interest at such rate as may be agreed upon by the mortgagor and the mortgagee. The Secretary may consent to the release of a part or parts of the mortgaged property from the lien of the blanket mortgage upon such terms and conditions as he may prescribe and the blanket mortgage may provide for such release. The project covered by the blanket mortgage may include four or more family units and such commercial and community facilities as the Secretary deems adequate to serve the occupants.</p>

<p class="statutory-body">The Secretary may further increase the dollar amount limitations which would otherwise <!-- PDFPage:652 -->apply under subsection (e) by not to exceed 20 per centum if such increase is necessary to account for the increased cost of a project due to the installation therein of a solar energy system (as defined in subparagraph (3) of the last paragraph of section 1703(a) of this title) or residential energy conservation measures (as defined in section 8211(11)(A) through (G) and (I) of title 42)&#160;<sup><a href="#1715y_1_target" name="1715y_1">1</a></sup> in cases where the Secretary determines that such measures are in addition to those required under the minimum property standards and will be cost-effective over the life of the measure.</p>

<!-- field-end:head -->
<!-- field-start:statute -->
<h4 class="subsection-head">(a) Authorization for periodic assistance payments to mortgagees; assistance to manufactured home buyers</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">(1) For the purpose of assisting lower income families in acquiring homeownership or in acquiring membership in a cooperative association operating a housing project, the Secretary is authorized to make, and to contract to make, periodic assistance payments on behalf of such homeowners and cooperative members. The assistance shall be accomplished through payments to mortgagees holding mortgages meeting the special requirements specified in this section or which mortgages are assisted under a State or local program providing assistance through loans, loan insurance or tax abatement. In making such assistance available, the Secretary shall give preference to low-income families who, without such assistance, would be likely to be involuntarily displaced (including those who would be likely to be displaced from rental units which are to be converted into a condominium project or a cooperative project). Such assistance may include the acquisition of a condominium or a membership in a cooperative association.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(2)(A) Notwithstanding any other provision of this section, the Secretary is authorized to make periodic assistance payments under this section on behalf of families whose incomes do not exceed the maximum income limits prescribed pursuant to subsection (h)(2) of this section for the purpose of assisting such families in acquiring ownership of a manufactured home consisting of two or more modules and a lot on which such manufactured home is or will be situated, except that periodic assistance payments pursuant to this paragraph shall not be made with respect to more than 20 per centum of the total number of units with respect to which assistance is approved under this section after January 1, 1976. Assistance payments under this section pursuant to this paragraph shall be accomplished through payments on behalf of an owner of lower-income of a manufactured home as described in the preceding sentence to the financial institution which makes the loan, advance of credit, or purchase of an obligation representing the loan or advance of credit to finance the purchase of the manufactured home and the lot on which such manufactured home is or will be situated, but only if insurance under section 1703 of this title covering such loan, advance of credit, or obligation has been granted to such institution.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(B) Notwithstanding the provisions of subsection (c) of this section, assistance payments provided pursuant to this paragraph shall be in an amount not exceeding the lesser of&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(i) the balance of the monthly payment for principal, interest, real and personal property taxes, insurance, and insurance premium chargeable under section 1703 of this title due under the loan or advance of credit remaining unpaid after applying 20 per centum of the manufactured homeowner's income; or</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(ii) the difference between the amount of the monthly payment for principal, interest, and insurance premium chargeable under section 1703 of this title which the manufactured homeowner is obligated to pay under the loan or advance of credit and the monthly payment of principal and interest which the owner would be obligated to pay if the loan or advance of credit were to bear interest at a rate derived by subtracting from the interest rate applicable to such loan or advance of credit the interest rate differential between the maximum interest rate plus mortgage insurance premium applicable to mortgages insured under subsection (i) of this section at the time such loan or advance of credit is made and the interest rate which such mortgages are presumed, under regulations prescribed by the Secretary, to bear for purposes of subsection (c)(2) of this section.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(b) Qualifications and eligibility requirements for assistance payments</h4>

<h3 class="section-head">&sect;1715z&ndash;1. Rental and cooperative housing for lower income families</h3>
<!-- field-end:head -->
<!-- field-start:statute -->
<h4 class="subsection-head">(a) Authorization for periodic interest reduction payments on behalf of owner of rental housing project</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">For the purpose of reducing rentals for lower income families, the Secretary is authorized to make, and to contract to make, periodic interest reduction payments on behalf of the owner of a rental housing project designed for occupancy by lower income families, which shall be accomplished through payments to morgagees&#160;<sup><a href="#1715z-1_1_target" name="1715z-1_1">1</a></sup> holding mortgages meeting the special requirements specified in this section.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(b) Restrictions on payments; payments with respect to projects financed under State or local programs; mortgage insurance premium</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">Interest reduction payments with respect to a project shall only be made during such time as the project is operated as a rental housing project and is subject to a mortgage which meets the requirements of, and is insured under, subsection (j) of this section: <i>Provided</i>, That the Secretary is authorized to continue making such interest reduction payments where the mortgage has been assigned to the Secretary: <i>Provided further</i>, That interest reduction payments may be made with respect to a mortgage or part thereof on a rental or cooperative housing project owned by a private nonprofit corporation or other private nonprofit entity, a limited dividend corporation or other limited dividend entity, public&#160;<sup><a href="#1715z-1_2_target" name="1715z-1_2">2</a></sup> entity, or a cooperative housing corporation, which is financed under a State or local program providing assistance through loans, loan insurance, or tax abatements, and which may involve either new or existing construction and which is approved for receiving the benefits of this section. The term &quot;mortgage insurance premium&quot;, when used in this section in relation to a project financed by a loan under a State or local program, means such fees and charges, approved by the Secretary, as are payable by the mortgagor to the State or local agency mortgagee to meet reserve requirements and administrative expenses of such agency.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(c) Amount of payments</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">The interest reduction payments to a mortgagee by the Secretary on behalf of a project owner shall be in an amount not exceeding the difference between the monthly payment for principal, interest, and mortgage insurance premium which the project owner as a mortgagor is obligated to pay under the mortgage and the monthly payment for principal and interest such project owner would be obligated to pay if the mortgage were to bear interest at the rate of 1 per centum per annum.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(d) Mortgage handling expenses</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">The Secretary may include in the payment to the mortgagee such amount, in addition to the amount computed under subsection (c), as he deems appropriate to reimburse the mortgagee for its expenses in handling the mortgage.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(e) Operation of project in accordance with requirements respecting tenant eligibility and rents prescribed by Secretary</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">(1) As a condition for receiving the benefits of interest reduction payments, the project owner shall operate the project in accordance with such requirements with respect to tenant eligibility and rents as the Secretary may prescribe. Procedures shall be adopted by the Secretary for review of tenant incomes at intervals of one year (or at shorter intervals where the Secretary deems it desirable).</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(2) A project for which interest reduction payments are made under this section and for which the mortgage on the project has been refinanced shall continue to receive the interest reduction payments under this section under the terms of the contract for such payments, but only if the project owner enters into such binding commitments as the Secretary may require (which shall be applicable to any subsequent owner) to ensure that the owner will continue to operate the project in accordance with all low-income affordability restrictions for the project in connection with the Federal assistance for the project for a period having a duration that is not less than the term for which such interest reduction payments are made plus an additional 5 years.</p>
<!-- PDFPage:668 --><h4 class="subsection-head">(f) Establishment of basic and fair market rental charges; rental for dwelling units; separate utility metering; additional assistance payments for low-income tenants; limitations; amounts; approval of payments</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">(1)(A)(i) For each dwelling unit there shall be established, with the approval of the Secretary, a basic rental charge and fair market rental charge.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(ii) The basic rental charge shall be&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(I) the amount needed to operate the project with payments of principal and interest due under a mortgage bearing interest at the rate of 1 percent per annum; or</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(II) an amount greater than that determined under clause (ii)(I), but not greater than the market rent for a comparable unassisted unit, reduced by the value of the interest reduction payments subsidy.</p>
<br class="Q04" />
<p class="statutory-body">(iii) The fair market rental charge shall be&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(I) the amount needed to operate the project with payments of principal, interest, and mortgage insurance premium which the mortgagor is obligated to pay under the mortgage covering the project; or</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(II) an amount greater than that determined under clause (iii)(I), but not greater than the market rent for a comparable unassisted unit.</p>
<br class="Q04" />
<p class="statutory-body">(iv) The Secretary may approve a basic rental charge and fair market rental charge for a unit that exceeds the minimum amounts permitted by this subparagraph for such charges only if&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(I) the approved basic rental charge and fair market rental charges each exceed the applicable minimum charge by the same amount; and</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(II) the project owner agrees to restrictions on project use or mortgage prepayment that are acceptable to the Secretary.</p>
<br class="Q04" />
<p class="statutory-body">(v) The Secretary may approve a basic rental charge and fair market rental charge under this paragraph for a unit with assistance under section 1437f of title 42 that differs from the basic rental charge and fair market rental charge for a unit in the same project that is similar in size and amenities but without such assistance, as needed to ensure equitable treatment of tenants in units without such assistance.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(B)(i) The rental charge for each dwelling unit shall be at the basic rental charge or such greater amount, not exceeding the fair market rental charge determined pursuant to subparagraph (A), as represents 30 percent of the tenant's adjusted income, except as otherwise provided in this subparagraph.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(ii) In the case of a project which contains more than 5000 units, is subject to an interest reduction payments contract, and is financed under a State or local project, the Secretary may reduce the rental charge ceiling, but in no case shall the rental charge be below the basic rental charge set forth in subparagraph (A)(ii)(I).</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(iii) For plans of action approved for capital grants under the Low-Income Housing Preservation and Resident Homeownership Act of 1990 [12 U.S.C. 4101 et seq.] or the Emergency Low Income Housing Preservation Act of 1987, the rental charge for each dwelling unit shall be at the minimum basic rental charge set forth in subparagraph (A)(ii)(I) or such greater amount, not exceeding the lower of: (I) the fair market rental charge set forth in subparagraph (A)(iii)(I); or (II) the actual rent paid for a comparable unit in comparable unassisted housing in the market area in which the housing assisted under this section is located, as represents 30 percent of the tenant's adjusted income.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(C) With respect to those projects which the Secretary determines have separate utility metering paid by the tenants for some or all dwelling units, the Secretary may&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(i) permit the basic rental charge and the fair market rental charge to be determined on the basis of operating the project without the payment of the cost of utility services used by such dwelling units; and</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(ii) permit the charging of a rental for such dwelling units at such an amount less than 30 percent of a tenant's adjusted income as the Secretary determines represents a proportionate decrease for the utility charges to be paid by such tenant, but in no case shall rental be lower than 25 percent of a tenant's adjusted income.</p>
<br class="Q04" />
<p class="statutory-body">(2) With respect to 20 per centum of the dwelling units in any project made subject to a contract under this section after August 22, 1974, the Secretary shall make, and contract to make, additional assistance payments to the project owner on behalf of tenants whose incomes are too low for them to afford the basic rentals (including the amount allowed for utilities in the case of a project with separate utility metering) with 30 per centum of their adjusted income. The additional assistance payments authorized by this paragraph with respect to any dwelling unit shall be the amount required to reduce the rental payment (including the amount allowed for utilities in the case of a project with separate utility metering) by the tenant to the highest of the following amounts, rounded to the nearest dollar:</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(A) 30 per centum of the tenant's monthly adjusted income;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(B) 10 per centum of the tenant's monthly income; or</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(C) if the family is receiving payments for welfare assistance from a public agency and a part of such payments, adjusted in accordance with the family's actual housing costs, is specifically designated by such agency to meet the family's housing costs, the portion of such payments which is so designated.</p>
<br class="Q04" />
<p class="statutory-body-block">Notwithstanding the foregoing provisions of this paragraph, the Secretary may&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(A) reduce such 20 per centum requirement in the case of any project if he determines that such action is necessary to assure the economic viability of the project; or</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(B) increase such 20 per centum requirement in the case of any project if he determines that such action is necessary and feasible in order to assure, insofar as is practicable, that there is in the project a reasonable range in the income levels of tenants, or that such action is to be taken to meet the housing needs of elderly or handicapped families.</p>
<br class="Q04" />
<p class="statutory-body">(3) The Secretary shall utilize amounts credited to the fund described in subsection (g) for <!-- PDFPage:669 -->the sole purpose of carrying out the purposes of section 201 of the Housing and Community Development Amendments of 1978. No payments may be made from such fund unless approved in an appropriation Act. No amount may be so approved for any fiscal year beginning after September 30, 1994.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(4) To ensure that eligible tenants occupying that number of units with respect to which assistance was being provided under this subsection immediately prior to November 30, 1983, receive the benefit of assistance contracted for under paragraph (2), the Secretary shall offer annually to amend contracts entered into under this subsection with owners of projects assisted but not subject to mortgages insured under this section to provide sufficient payments to cover 100 percent of the necessary rent increases and changes in the incomes of eligible tenants, subject to the availability of authority for such purpose under section 1437c(c) of title 42. The Secretary shall take such actions as may be necessary to ensure that payments, including payments that reflect necessary rent increases and changes in the incomes of tenants, are made on a timely basis for all units covered by contracts entered into under paragraph (2).</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(5)(A) In order to induce advances by owners for capital improvements (excluding any owner contributions that may be required by the Secretary as a condition for assistance under section 201 of the Housing and Community Development Amendments of 1978) to benefit projects assisted under this section, in establishing basic rental charges and fair market rental charges under paragraph (1) the Secretary may include an amount that would permit a return of such advances with interest to the owner out of project income, on such terms and conditions as the Secretary may determine. Any resulting increase in rent contributions shall be&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(i) to a level not exceeding the lower of 30 percent of the adjusted income of the tenant or the published existing fair market rent for comparable housing established under section 1437f(c) of title 42;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(ii) phased in equally over a period of not less than 3 years, if such increase is 30 percent or more; and</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(iii) limited to not more than 10 percent per year if such increase is more than 10 percent but less than 30 percent.</p>
<br class="Q04" />
<p class="statutory-body">(B) Assistance under section 1437f of title 42 shall be provided, to the extent available under appropriations Acts, if necessary to mitigate any adverse effects on income-eligible tenants.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(6) Repealed. Pub. L. 104&ndash;99, title IV, &sect;405(d)(2), Jan. 26, 1996, 110 Stat. 45.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(7) The Secretary shall determine whether and under what conditions the provisions of this subsection shall apply to mortgages sold by the Secretary on a negotiated basis.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(g) Collection of excess rental charges; credit to reserve for additional assistance payments; retention by project owner</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">(1) The project owner shall, as required by the Secretary, accumulate, safeguard, and periodically pay the Secretary or such other entity as determined by the Secretary and upon such terms and conditions as the Secretary deems appropriate, all rental charges collected on a unit-by-unit basis in excess of the basic rental charges. Unless otherwise directed by the Secretary, such excess charges shall be credited to a reserve used by the Secretary to make additional assistance payments as provided in paragraph (3) of subsection (f).</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(2) Notwithstanding any other requirements of this subsection, a project owner may retain some or all of such excess charges for project use if authorized by the Secretary. Such excess charges shall be used for the project and upon terms and conditions established by the Secretary, unless the Secretary permits the owner to retain funds for non-project use after a determination that the project is well-maintained housing in good condition and that the owner has not engaged in material adverse financial or managerial actions or omissions as described in section 516 of the Multifamily Assisted Housing Reform and Affordability Act of 1997. In connection with the retention of funds for non-project use, the Secretary may require the project owner to enter into a binding commitment (which shall be applicable to any subsequent owner) to ensure that the owner will continue to operate the project in accordance with all low-income affordability restrictions for the project in connection with the Federal assistance for the project for a period having a duration of not less than the term of the existing affordability restrictions plus an additional 5 years.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(3) The Secretary shall not withhold approval of the retention by the owner of such excess charges because of the existence of unpaid excess charges if such unpaid amount is being remitted to the Secretary over a period of time in accordance with a workout agreement with the Secretary, unless the Secretary determines that the owner is in violation of the workout agreement.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(h) Rules and regulations</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">In addition to establishing the requirements specified in subsection (e), the Secretary is authorized to make such rules and regulations, to enter into such agreements, and to adopt such procedures as he may deem necessary or desirable to carry out the provisions of this section.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(i) Authorization of appropriations; aggregate amount of contracts; contracts for assistance payments; income limitations; availability of amounts for projects approved prior to rehabilitation and projects for occupancy by elderly or handicapped families; definitions</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">(1) There are authorized to be appropriated such sums as may be necessary to carry out the provisions of this section, including such sums as may be necessary to make interest reduction payments under contracts entered into by the Secretary under this section. The aggregate amount of outstanding contracts to make such payments shall not exceed amounts approved in appropriation Acts, and payments pursuant to such contracts shall not exceed $75,000,000 per annum prior to July 1, 1969, which maximum dollar amount shall be increased by $125,000,000 on July 1, 1969, by $150,000,000 on July 1, 1970, by $200,000,000 on July 1, 1971 and by $75,000,000 on July 1, 1974. The Secretary shall utilize, to the extent necessary after September 30, 1984, any <!-- PDFPage:670 -->authority under this section that is recaptured either as the result of the conversion of housing projects covered by assistance under subsection (f)(2) to contracts for assistance under section 1437f of title 42 or otherwise for the purpose of making assistance payments, including amendments as provided in subsection (f)(4), with respect to housing projects assisted, but not subject to mortgages insured, under this section that remain covered by assistance under subsection (f)(2).</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(2) Contracts for assistance payments under this section may be entered into only with respect to tenants whose incomes do not exceed 80 per centum of the median family income for the area, as determined by the Secretary with adjustments for smaller and larger families, except that the Secretary may establish income ceilings higher or lower than 80 per centum of the median for the area on the basis of his findings that such variations are necessary because of prevailing levels of construction costs, unusually high or low family incomes, or other factors.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(3) Not less than 10 per centum of the total amount of contracts for assistance payments authorized by appropriation Acts to be made after June 30, 1974, shall be available for use only with respect to dwellings, or dwelling units in projects, which are approved by the Secretary prior to rehabilitation.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(4) At least 20 per centum of the total amount of contracts for assistance payments authorized in appropriation Acts to be made after June 30, 1974, shall be available for use only with respect to projects which are planned in whole or in part for occupancy by elderly or handicapped families. As used in this paragraph, the term &quot;elderly families&quot; means families which consist of two or more persons the head of which (or his spouse) is sixty-two years of age or over or is handicapped. Such term also means a single person who is sixty-two years of age or over or is handicapped. A person shall be considered handicapped if such person is determined, pursuant to regulations issued by the Secretary, to have an impairment which (A) is expected to be of long-continued and indefinite duration, (B) substantially impedes his ability to live independently, and (C) is of such a nature that such ability could be improved by more suitable housing conditions.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(j) Insurance of mortgages; definitions; eligibility for insurance; mortgage requirements; property or project requirements; sale of individual dwelling units; release of mortgagor from liability or release of property from lien of mortgage</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">(1) The Secretary is authorized, upon application by the mortgagee, to insure a mortgage (including advances on such mortgage during construction) which meets the requirements of this subsection.

All payments made pursuant to claims of mortgagees with respect to mortgages insured under sections 1715x(a)(2), 1715z, 1715z&ndash;1, 1715z&ndash;2, and 1715z&ndash;8 of this title or pursuant to section 1715n(e) of this title, cash adjustments, the principal of and interest paid on debentures which are the obligation of the fund, expenses incurred in connection with or as a consequence of the acquisition and disposal of property acquired under such sections, and all administrative expenses in connection with the mortgage insurance operations under such sections shall be paid out of the fund. Moneys in the fund not needed for current operations of the fund shall be deposited with the Treasurer of the United States to the credit of the fund or invested in bonds or other obligations of, or in bonds or other obligations guaranteed by, the United States or any agency of the United States: <i>Provided</i>, That such moneys shall to the maximum extent feasible be invested in such bonds or other obligations the proceeds of which will be used to directly support the residential mortgage market. The Secretary, with the approval of the Secretary of the Treasury, may purchase in the open market debentures which are the obligation of the fund. Such purchases shall be made at a price which will provide an investment yield of not less than the yield obtained from other investments authorized by this section. Debentures so purchased shall be canceled and not reissued.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(c) Mortgage insurance for military impacted areas; criteria; obligation of Special Risk Insurance Fund; establishment of premiums and other charges</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">(1) Notwithstanding the provisions of this chapter or any other Act, and without regard to limitations upon eligibility contained in any section of this subchapter, the Secretary is authorized, upon application by the mortgagee, to insure under any section of this subchapter a mortgage executed in connection with the construction, repair, rehabilitation, or purchase of property located near any installation of the Armed Forces of the United States in federally impacted areas in which the conditions are such that one or more of the eligibility requirements applicable to the section under which insurance is sought could not be met, if (A) the Secretary finds that the benefits to be derived from such use outweigh the risk of probable cost to the Government, and (B) the Secretary of Defense certifies that there is no intention insofar as can reasonably be foreseen to curtail substantially the personnel assigned or to be assigned to such installation. The insurance of a mortgage pursuant to this subsection shall be the obligation of the Special Risk Insurance Fund.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(2) The Secretary is authorized (A) to establish such premiums and other charges as may be necessary to assure that the mortgage insurance program pursuant to this subsection is made available on a basis which, in the Secretary's judgment, is designed to be actuarially sound and likely to maintain the fiscal integrity of such program, and (B) to prescribe such terms and conditions relating to insurance pursuant to this subsection as may be found by the Secretary to be necessary and appropriate, and which are to the maximum extent possible, consistent with provisions otherwise applicable to mortgage insurance and payment of insurance benefits.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(3) The Secretary shall undertake an annual assessment of the risks associated with each of the insurance programs comprising the Special Risk Insurance Fund, and shall present findings from such review to the Congress in the FHA Annual Management Report.</p>

<h4 class="subsection-head">(a) Action to recover assets or income</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">(1) The Secretary of Housing and Urban Development (referred to in this section as the &quot;Secretary&quot;) may request the Attorney General to bring an action in a United States district court to recover any assets or income used by any person in violation of (A) a regulatory agreement that applies to a multifamily project, nursing home, intermediate care facility, board and care home, assisted living facility, or hospital whose mortgage is or, at the time of the violations, was insured or held by the Secretary under title II of the National Housing Act [12 U.S.C. 1707 et seq.]; (B) a regulatory agreement that applies to a multifamily project whose mortgage is or, at the time of the violations, was insured or held by the Secretary under section 1701q of this title (including property subject to section 1701q of this title as it existed before November 28, 1990); (C) a regulatory agreement or such other form of regulatory control as may be imposed by the Secretary that applies to mortgages insured or held or, at the time of the violations, was&#160;<sup><a href="#1715z-4a_1_target" name="1715z-4a_1">1</a></sup> insured or held by the Secretary under section 1715z&ndash;22 of this title, but not reinsured under section 1715z&ndash;22 of this title; or (D) any applicable regulation. For purposes of this section, a use of assets or income in violation of the regulatory agreement, or such other form of regulatory control as may be imposed by the Secretary, or any applicable regulation shall include any use for which the documentation in the books and accounts does not establish that the use was made for a reasonable operating expense or necessary repair of the property and has not been maintained in accordance with the requirements of the Secretary and in reasonable condition for proper audit.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(2) For purposes of a mortgage insured or held by the Secretary under title II of the National Housing Act [12 U.S.C. 1707 et seq.], under section 1701q of this title (including section 1701q of this title as it existed before November 28, 1990) and under section 1715z&ndash;22 of this title, the term &quot;any person&quot; shall mean any person or entity that owns or operates a property, as identified in the regulatory agreement, including but not limited to&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(A) any stockholder holding 25 percent or more interest of a corporation that owns that property;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(B) any beneficial owner of the property under any business or trust;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(C) any officer, director, or partner of an entity owning or controlling the property;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(D) any nursing home lessee or operator;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(E) any hospital lessee or operator;</p>

<h4 class="subsection-head">(b) Initiation of proceedings and temporary relief</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">The Attorney General, upon request of the Secretary, shall have the exclusive authority to authorize the initiation of proceedings under this section. Pending final resolution of any action under this section, the court may grant appropriate temporary or preliminary relief, including restraining orders, injunctions, and acceptance of satisfactory performance bonds, to protect the interests of the Secretary and to prevent use of assets or income in violation of the regulatory agreement, or such other form of regulatory control as may be imposed by the Secretary, and any applicable regulation and to prevent loss of value of the realty and personalty involved.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(c) Amount recoverable</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">In any judgment favorable to the United States entered under this section, the Attorney General may recover double the value of the assets and income of the property that the court determines to have been used in violation of the regulatory agreement, or such other form of regulatory control as may be imposed by the Secretary, or any applicable regulation, plus all costs relating to the action, including but not limited to reasonable attorney and auditing fees. Notwithstanding any other provision of law, the Secretary may apply the recovery, or any portion of the recovery, to the property or to the applicable insurance fund under the National Housing Act [12 U.S.C. 1701 et seq.] or, in the case of any project for which the mortgage is held by the Secretary under section 1701q of this title (including property subject to section 1701q of this title as it existed before November 28, 1990), to the project or to the Department for use by the appropriate office within the Department for administrative costs related to enforcement of the requirements of the various programs administered by the Secretary, as appropriate.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(d) Time limitation</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">Notwithstanding any other statute of limitations, the Secretary may request the Attorney General to bring an action under this section at any time up to and including 6 years after the latest date that the Secretary discovers any use of a property's assets and income in violation of the regulatory agreement, or such other form of regulatory control as may be imposed by the Secretary, or any applicable regulation.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(e) Continued availability of other remedies</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">The remedy provided by this section is in addition to any other remedies available to the Secretary or the United States.</p>

<p class="statutory-body">The purpose of this section is to assist the provision of urgently needed hospitals for the care and treatment of persons who are acutely ill or who otherwise require medical care and related services of the kind customarily furnished only (or most effectively) by hospitals. Such assistance shall be provided regardless of the amount of public financial or other support a hospital may receive, and the Secretary shall neither require additional security or collateral to guarantee such support, nor impose more stringent eligibility or other requirements on publicly owned or supported hospitals.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(b) Definitions</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">For the purposes of this section&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(1) the term &quot;hospital&quot; means a facility&mdash;</p>

<p class="statutory-body-2em">(C) which is a public facility, proprietary facility, or facility of a private nonprofit corporation or association, licensed or regulated by the State (or, if there is no State law providing for such licensing or regulation by the State, by the municipality or other political subdivision in which the facility is located); and</p>

<p class="statutory-body-1em">(2) the terms &quot;mortgage&quot; and &quot;mortgagor&quot; shall have the meanings respectfully set forth in section 1713(a) of this title.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(c) Authorization to insure; prohibition of premiums on guarantees of principal and interest under title VII of the Public Health Service Act</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">The Secretary is authorized to insure any mortgage (including advances on such mortgage during construction) in accordance with the provisions of this section upon such terms and conditions as he may prescribe and to make commitments for insurance of such mortgage prior to the date of its execution or disbursement thereon. No mortgage insurance premium shall be charged with respect to the amount of principal and interest guaranteed by the Department of Health and Human Services under title VII of the Public Health Service Act [42 U.S.C. 292 et seq.].</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(d) Insurance of mortgages covering new or rehabilitated hospitals, including equipment; terms and conditions</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">In order to carry out the purpose of this section, the Secretary is authorized to insure any mortgage which covers a new or rehabilitated hospital, including equipment to be used in its operation, subject to the following conditions:</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(1) The mortgage shall be executed by a mortgagor approved by the Secretary. The Secretary may in his discretion require any such mortgagor to be regulated or restricted as to charges and methods of financing, and, in addition thereto, if the mortgagor is a corporate entity, as to capital structure and rate <!-- PDFPage:697 -->of return. As an aid to the regulation or restriction of any mortgagor with respect to any of the foregoing matters, the Secretary may make such contracts with and acquire for not to exceed $100 such stock or interest in such mortgagor as he may deem necessary. Any stock or interest so purchased shall be paid for out of the General Insurance Fund, and shall be redeemed by the mortgagor at par upon the termination of all obligations of the Secretary under the insurance.</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(2) The mortgage shall involve a principal obligation in the amount requested by the mortgagor if such amount does not exceed 90 percent of the estimated replacement cost of the property or project including&mdash;</p>

<br class="Q04" />
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(3) The mortgage shall&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(A) provide for complete amortization by periodic payments within such term as the Secretary shall prescribe; and</p>

<br class="Q04" />
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(4)(A) The Secretary shall require satisfactory evidence that the hospital will be located in a State or political subdivision of a State with reasonable minimum standards of licensure and methods of operation for hospitals and satisfactory assurance that such standards will be applied and enforced with respect to the hospital.</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(B) The Secretary shall establish the means for determining need and feasibility for the hospital, if the State does not have an official procedure for determining need for hospitals. If the State has an official procedure for determining need for hospitals, the Secretary shall require that such procedure be followed before the application for insurance is submitted, and the application shall document that need has also been established under that procedure.</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(5) The Secretary shall not insure any mortgage or approve any modification of an existing mortgage insured pursuant to this section or section 1715n(f) of this title if such insurance or modification is to be made in connection with a guarantee, as authorized pursuant to section 1721 of this title, of a trust certificate or other security which is exempt from Federal taxation or which is to be used to collateralize obligations which are so exempt, except that the Secretary shall not refuse to insure such a mortgage or approve such a modification solely on the basis that such insurance or modification is to be made in connection with a guarantee, as authorized pursuant to section 1721 of this title, of a trust certificate or other security which is exempt from Federal taxation or which is to be used to collateralize obligations which are so exempt if&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(A) a written application for such insurance or modification submitted at the express direction of the hospital has been submitted to the appropriate office of the Department of Health and Human Services prior to March 29, 1979; or</p>

<br class="Q04" />
<p class="statutory-body-block-1em">This paragraph shall not limit the authority of the Secretary to approve a mortgage increase on any mortgage eligible for insurance under this paragraph at any time prior to final endorsement of the loan for insurance; except that such mortgage increase may not be approved for the cost of constructing any improvements not included in the original plans and specifications approved by the Department of Health and Human Services unless approved by the Secretary of Housing and Urban Development and by the Secretary of Health and Human Services.</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(6) To the extent that a private nonprofit or public facility mortgagor is required by the Secretary to provide cash equity in excess of the amount of the mortgage to complete the project, the mortgagor shall be entitled, at the option of the mortgagee, to fund the excess with a letter of credit. In such event, mortgage proceeds may be advanced to the mortgagor prior to any demand being made on the letter of credit.</p>

<h3 class="section-head">&sect;1715z&ndash;8. Mortgage assistance payments for middle-income families</h3>
<!-- field-end:head -->
<!-- field-start:statute -->
<h4 class="subsection-head">(a) Determination by Secretary of necessity; interest subsidy payments; effective date</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">Whenever he determines such action to be necessary in furtherance of the purposes set forth in section 501 of the Emergency Home Finance Act of 1970, the Secretary is authorized to make, and to contract to make, periodic assistance payments on behalf of families of middle income. The assistance shall be accomplished through interest subsidy payments to the Federal National Mortgage Association or the Federal Home Loan Mortgage Corporation (hereinafter referred to as &quot;the investor&quot;) with respect to mortgages meeting the special requirements <!-- PDFPage:700 -->specified in this section and made after July 24, 1970.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(b) Qualifications of mortgagor for assistance payments</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">To qualify for assistance payments a middle-income family shall be a mortgagor under a mortgage which is (1) insured under subsection (j) of this section, (2) guaranteed under chapter 37 of title 38, or (3) a conventional mortgage meeting the requirements of subsection (j)(3) of this section. In addition to the foregoing requirement, the Secretary may require that the mortgagor have an income, at the time of acquisition of the property, of not more than the median income for the area in which the property is located, as determined by the Secretary, with appropriate adjustments for smaller and larger families.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(c) Termination of interest subsidy payments</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">The interest subsidy payments authorized by this section shall cease when (1) the mortgagor no longer occupies the property which secures the mortgage, (2) the mortgages are no longer held by the investor, or (3) the rate of interest paid by the mortgagor reaches the rate of interest specified on the mortgage.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(d) Monthly mortgage payments as determining eligibility for interest subsidy payments; mortgage assistance payments for middle-income cooperative members; interest subsidy payments; applicability of provisions to cooperative mortgagors</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">(1) Interest subsidy payments shall be on mortgages on which the mortgagor makes monthly payments towards principal and interest equal to an amount which would be required if the mortgage bore an effective interest rate of 7 per centum per annum including any discounts or charges in the nature of points or otherwise (but not including premiums, if any, for mortgage insurance) or such higher rate (not to exceed the rate specified in the mortgage), which the mortgagor could pay by applying at least 20 per centum of his income towards homeownership expenses. As used in this subsection, the term &quot;monthly homeownership expense&quot; includes the monthly payment for principal, interest, mortgage insurance premium, insurance, and taxes due under the mortgage.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(2) In addition to the mortgages eligible for assistance under paragraph (1) of this subsection, the Secretary is authorized to make periodic assistance payments on behalf of cooperative members of middle income. Such assistance payments shall be accomplished through interest subsidy payments to the investor with respect to mortgages insured (subsequent to July 24, 1970) under section 1715e of this title which are executed by cooperatives, the membership in which is limited to middle-income families. For purposes of this paragraph&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(A) the term &quot;mortgagor&quot;, when used in subsection (b) in the case of a mortgage covering a cooperative housing project, means a member of the cooperative;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(B) the term &quot;acquisition of the property&quot;, when used in subsection (b), means the family's application for a dwelling unit; and</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(C) in the case of a cooperative mortgagor, subsection (c) shall not apply and the interest subsidy payments shall cease when the mortgage is no longer held by the investor or the cooperative fails to limit membership to families whose incomes at the time of their application for a dwelling unit meets such requirements as are laid down by the Secretary pursuant to subsection (b).</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(e) Amount of interest subsidy payments</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">The interest subsidy payments shall be in an amount equal to the difference, as determined by the Secretary, between the total amount of interest per calendar quarter received by the investor on mortgages assisted under this section and purchased by it and the total amount of interest which the investor would have received if the yield on such mortgages was equal to the sum of (1) the average costs (expressed as an annual percentage rate) to it of all borrowed funds outstanding in the immediately preceding calendar quarter, and (2) such per centum per annum as will provide for administrative and other expenses of the investor and a reasonable economic return, as determined by the Secretary to be necessary and appropriate taking into account the purpose of this section to provide additional mortgage credit at reasonable rates of interest to middle-income families.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(f) Adoption of procedures for recertifications of mortgagor's income</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">Procedures shall be adopted by the Secretary for recertifications of the mortgagor's income at intervals of two years (or at shorter intervals where the Secretary deems it desirable) for the purpose of adjusting the amount of the mortgagor's payments pursuant to subsection (d).</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(g) Regulations to assure that sales price or other consideration paid is not increased above appraised value</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">The Secretary shall prescribe such regulations as he deems necessary to assure that the sales price of, or other consideration paid in connection with, the purchase by a homeowner of the property with respect to which assistance payments are to be made is not increased above the appraised value on which the maximum mortgage which the Secretary will insure is computed.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(h) Authorization of appropriations; aggregate amount of assistance payment contracts; termination date</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">(1) There are authorized to be appropriated such sums as may be necessary to enable the Secretary to make interest subsidy payments under contracts entered into under this section. The aggregate amount of contracts to make such payments shall not exceed amounts approved in appropriation Acts, and payments pursuant to such contracts shall not exceed $105,000,000 during the first year of such contracts prior to July 1, 1971, which amount shall be increased by an additional $105,000,000 during the first year of an additional number of such contracts on July 1 of each of the years 1971 and 1972.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(2) No interest subsidy payments under this section shall be made after June 30, 1973, except pursuant to contracts entered into on or before such date.</p>
<!-- PDFPage:701 --><h4 class="subsection-head">(i) Determination of family income; exclusion of income of minors</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">In determining the income of any family for the purposes of this section, income from all sources of each member of the family in the household shall be included, except that the Secretary shall exclude income earned by any minor person.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(j) Insurance of mortgages executed by mortgagors meeting eligibility requirements for assistance payments; issuance of commitment; eligibility requirements for insurance</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">(1) The Secretary is authorized, upon application by the mortgagee, to insure a mortgage executed by a mortgagor who meets the eligibility requirements for assistance payments prescribed by the Secretary under subsection (b). Commitments for the insurance of such mortgages may be issued by the Secretary prior to the date of their execution or disbursement thereon, upon such terms and conditions as the Secretary may prescribe.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(2) To be eligible for insurance under this subsection, a mortgage shall meet the requirements of section 1715l(d)(2) or 1715y(c) of this title, except as such requirements are modified by this subsection: <i>Provided, however</i>, That in the discretion of the Secretary 25 per centum of the authority conferred by this section and subject to all the terms thereof may be used for mortgages on existing housing.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(3) A mortgage to be insured under this section shall&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(i) involve a single-family dwelling which has been approved by the Secretary prior to the beginning of construction, or a one-family unit in a condominium project (together with an undivided interest in the common areas and facilities serving the project) which is released from a multifamily project, the construction of which has been completed within two years prior to the filing of the application for assistance payments with respect to such family unit and the unit shall have had no previous occupant other than the mortgagor;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(ii) involve a single-family dwelling whose appraised value, as determined by the Secretary, is not in excess of $20,000 (which amount may be increased by not more than 50 per centum in any geographical area where the Secretary authorizes an increase on the basis of a finding that the cost level so requires); and</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(iii) be executed by a mortgagor who shall have paid in cash or its equivalent on account of the property (A) 3 per centum of the first $15,000 of the appraised value of the property, (B) 10 per centum of such value in excess of $15,000 but not in excess of $25,000, and (C) 20 per centum of such value in excess of $25,000.</p>

<h4 class="subsection-head">(a) Authority of Secretary; request of mortgagee; premium charges; provisions of contract of co-insurance; non-applicability of state insurance laws</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">In addition to providing insurance as otherwise authorized under this chapter, and notwithstanding any other provision of this chapter inconsistent with this section, the Secretary, upon request of any mortgagee and for such mortgage insurance premium as he may prescribe (which premium, or other charges to be paid by the mortgagor, shall not exceed the premium, or other charges, that would otherwise be applicable), may insure and make a commitment to insure under any provision of this subchapter any mortgage, advance, or loan otherwise eligible under such provision, pursuant to a co-insurance contract providing that the mortgagee will&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(1) assume a percentage of any loss on the insured mortgage, advance, or loan in direct proportion to the amount of the co-insurance, which co-insurance shall not be less than 10 per centum, subject to any reasonable limit or limits on the liability of the mortgagee that may be specified in the event of unusual or catastrophic losses that may be incurred by any one mortgagee; and</p>

A mortgagee which enters into a contract of co-insurance under this section shall not by reason of such contract, or its adherence to such contract or applicable regulations of the Secretary, including provisions relating to the retention of risks in the event of sale or assignment of a mortgage, be made subject to any State law regulating the business of insurance.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(b) Inspection of construction of dwellings or projects as prerequisite; minimum standards or criteria applicable</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">No insurance shall be granted pursuant to this section with respect to dwellings or projects approved for insurance prior to the beginning of construction unless the inspection of such construction is conducted in accordance with at least the minimum standards and criteria used with respect to dwellings or projects approved for mortgage insurance pursuant to other provisions of this subchapter.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(c) Repealed. Pub. L. 100&ndash;242, title IV, &sect;414(a), Feb. 5, 1988, 101 Stat. 1907</h4>

<h4 class="subsection-head">(e) Availability unaffecting insurance otherwise authorized; criteria for exercise of authority by Secretary</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">The Secretary shall not withdraw, deny, or delay insurance otherwise authorized under any other provision of this chapter by reason of the availability of insurance pursuant to this section. The Secretary shall exercise his authority under this section only to the extent that he finds that the continued exercise of such authority will not adversely affect the flow of mortgage credit to older and declining neighborhoods and to the purchasers of older and lower cost housing.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(f) Multifamily housing project; contract provisions; aggregate principal amount of all mortgages insured; loans on defaulted mortgages; insurance for state assisted projects and projects under construction; definitions; amount of reserves</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">(1) Where the mortgage covers a multifamily housing project, the co-insurance contract may provide that the mortgagee assume (i) the full amount of any loss on the insured mortgage up to an amount equal to a fixed percentage of the outstanding principal balance of the mortgage at the time of claim for insurance benefits, or (ii) the full amount of any losses on insured mortgages in a portfolio of mortgages approved by the Secretary up to an amount equal to a fixed percentage of the outstanding principal balance of all mortgages in such portfolio at the time of claim for insurance benefits on a mortgage in the portfolio, plus a share of any loss in excess of the amount under clause (i) or (ii), whichever is applicable.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(2) The Secretary may make loans, from the applicable insurance fund, to public housing agencies in connection with mortgages which have been insured pursuant to this subsection and which are in default.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(3) The Secretary may insure and make a commitment to insure in connection with a co-insurance contract pursuant to this subsection (A) a mortgage on a project assisted under the second proviso in the first sentence of section 1715z&ndash;1(b) of this title, and (B) a mortgage or advance on a mortgage made to a public housing agency on a project under construction which is not approved for insurance prior to construction.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(4) As used in this subsection, the term &quot;public housing agency&quot; has the meaning given such term in section 1437a(b)(6) of title 42.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(5) Notwithstanding any other provision of this chapter, the Secretary may include in the determination of replacement cost of a project to be covered by a mortgage made to a public housing agency and insured pursuant to this subsection, such reserves and development costs, not to exceed 5 per centum of the amount otherwise allowable, as may be established or authorized by the public housing agency consistent with such agency's procedures and underwriting standards.</p>

<p class="statutory-body">Notwithstanding any other provision of this section, in the case of a mortgage insured under section 1715n(f) of this title secured by property which is to be rehabilitated or developed under section 1437o&#160;<sup><a href="#1715z-9_1_target" name="1715z-9_1">1</a></sup> of title 42, such co-insurance may include provisions that&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(1) insurance benefits shall equal the sum of (A) 90 per centum of the mortgage on the date of institution of foreclosure proceedings (or on the date of acquisition of the property otherwise after default), and (B) 90 per centum of interest arrears on the date benefits are paid;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(2) the mortgagee shall remit to the Secretary, for credit to the General Insurance Fund, 90 per centum of any proceeds of the property, including sale proceeds, net of the mortgagee's actual and reasonable costs related to the property and the enforcement of security;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(3) payment of such benefits shall be made in cash unless the mortgagee submits a written request for debenture payment; and</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(4) the underwriter of co-insurance may reinsure 10 per centum of the mortgage amount with a private mortgage insurance company or with a State mortgage insurance agency.</p>

<p class="statutory-body">Any mortgagee which enters into a contract of co-insurance under this section shall have the authority to assign its interest in any note or <!-- PDFPage:703 -->mortgage subject to a contract of co-insurance to a warehouse bank or other financial institution which provides interim funding for a loan co-insured under this section, and to retain the co-insurance risk of such note or mortgage, upon such terms and conditions as the Secretary shall prescribe.</p>

<p class="statutory-body">The Secretary shall, by January 15 and July 15 of each year (1) review the adequacy of capital and other requirements for mortgagees under this section, (2) assess the compliance by mortgagees with such requirements, and (3) make such adjustment to such requirements as the Secretary, after providing opportunity for hearing, determines to be appropriate to improve the long-term financial soundness of the Federal Housing Administration funds. Such requirements shall include the minimum capital or net worth of mortgagees; the ratio that mortgagees shall maintain between the mortgagee's capital and the volume of mortgages co-insured by such mortgagee; and such other requirements as the Secretary determines to be appropriate to ensure the long-term financial soundness of the Federal Housing Administration funds. The Secretary shall submit to the Committee on Banking, Housing, and Urban Affairs of the Senate and the Committee on Banking, Finance and Urban Affairs of the House of Representatives a report on the review and assessment under the previous sentence, and an explanation of the Secretary's reasons for making any adjustment in requirements authorized under this section.</p>

<h3 class="section-head">&sect;1715z&ndash;13. Single family mortgage insurance on Indian reservations</h3>
<!-- field-end:head -->
<!-- field-start:statute -->
<h4 class="subsection-head">(a) One- to four-family residence; eligibility</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">The Secretary, subject to such special conditions as the Secretary may prescribe, may insure under any provision of this subchapter that authorizes such insurance, a mortgage covering a property upon which there is located a one- to four-family residence, without regard to any limitation in this chapter relating to marketability of title or any other limitation in this chapter that the Secretary determines is contrary to promoting the availability of such insurance on Indian reservations if the mortgage (1) is executed by an Indian tribe and the property is located on trust or otherwise restricted land; or (2) is executed by a member of an Indian tribe who will use the property as a principal residence and the property is on trust or otherwise restricted land.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(b) Construction advances; percentage limitation on amount of principal obligation; pledge of income from tribal resources or assets</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">Notwithstanding any other provision of this chapter, with respect to mortgages covering a property upon which there is located a one- to four-family residence&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(1) the Secretary may insure and make commitments to insure under this subchapter pursuant to this section advances made during construction where the Secretary determines that the proposed construction is otherwise acceptable and meets an applicable tribal or national model building code, and that no feasible financing alternative is available;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(2) the applicable percentage limitation on the amount of the principal obligation of a mortgage based on the appraised value or replacement cost, as appropriate, of a one- to four-family owner-occupied residence contained in this subchapter shall apply in the case of all mortgages insured pursuant to this section without regard to whether the residences are owner-occupied where the residences are owned by the tribe; and</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(3)(A) the Secretary may require an Indian tribe, only as a condition of insurance made under this subchapter pursuant to this section, to pledge income from tribal resources or income from tribal assets not subject to a restriction by the Secretary of the Interior or pledge grants under title I of the Housing and Community Development Act of 1974 [42 U.S.C. 5301 et seq.] or any other Federal grant program administered by the Secretary of Housing and Urban Development to be used to reimburse the Secretary for any mortgage insurance claims paid in connection with residences insured pursuant to this section; or</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(B) in the case of an individual Indian mortgagor, the Secretary may require a pledge of his or her share of distributed income from tribal resources or income from tribal assets, excluding any Federal grants received by the tribe.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(c) Lack of tribal or trust fund income</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">The Secretary may not refuse to insure a mortgage under this section to an individual home purchaser because there is no distributed tribal or trust fund income attributable to that purchaser.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(d) Availability of tribal eviction procedures</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">Before making any commitment to insure a mortgage under this section with respect to property located on trust or otherwise restricted land, the Secretary shall require a showing by the tribe that it has adopted eviction procedures to be used in the event of a default.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(e) Assumption of mortgage</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">A mortgage insured under this section may be assumed, subject to credit approval by the lender and the consent of the tribe to an assumption of the existing lease or the grant of a new lease, without an adjustment of the interest rate. Any other sale of a property subject to a mortgage insured under this section may be made only if a new lease is granted, except that a sale following a foreclosure may be accompanied by an assumption of the lease with the consent of the tribe.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(f) Insurance of mortgage as obligation of General Insurance Fund</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">Notwithstanding any other provision of this chapter, the insurance of a mortgage using the authority contained in this section shall be the obligation of the Mutual Mortgage Insurance Fund. The mortgagee shall be eligible to receive the benefits of insurance as provided in section 1710 of this title with respect to mortgages insured pursuant to this section, except that all references in section 1710 of this title to section 1709 of this title shall be construed to refer to the section under which the mortgage is insured.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(g) Availability of status and payment history of loans; entitlement to benefit of insurance; reinstatement of loan upon cure of default; garnishment proceedings; foreclosure proceedings</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">(1) The Secretary shall make information regarding the status and payment history of loans insured under this section available to local credit bureaus and prospective creditors. Prior to accepting assignment of a mortgage, the Secretary shall require mortgagees to submit documentation that mortgagors have been counseled in a face-to-face interview, informed of the provisions of this subsection or other available as<!-- PDFPage:710 -->sistance, and provided with the names and addresses of officials of the Department of Housing and Urban Development to whom further communications shall be addressed.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(2) Notwithstanding the requirement for conveyance of title under section 1710 of this title, a mortgagee under this section shall be entitled to receive the benefit of insurance under this section in the case of a mortgage which is more than 90 days in default upon conveyance of the lease agreement and the mortgage documents.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(3) In the event that any default is cured, the Secretary shall seek to reinstate the loan with the mortgagee or another mortgagee. For purposes of this paragraph, the Secretary may provide appropriate financial incentives to reinstate the loan commensurate with sound management of the General Insurance Fund.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(4) If the Secretary determines that a mortgagor is not making a good-faith effort to cure a default, and that trust fund or tribal income is available under subsection (b)(3)(B), the Secretary shall commence proceedings for the garnishment of the mortgagor's distributed share of tribal or trust fund income in order to collect loan payments that are past due. Proceedings under this paragraph may be instituted in a tribal court, court of competent jurisdiction designated by the tribe, or Federal district court.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(5) If the Secretary determines such action is necessary to protect the General Insurance Fund from undue loss, the Secretary may initiate foreclosure proceedings with respect to any mortgage acquired under this subsection. Such proceeding may take place in a tribal court, a court of competent jurisdiction, or Federal district court. Any such court shall have jurisdiction to convey to the Secretary the remaining life of a lease on the real property and to order eviction of the delinquent mortgagor.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(h) Premium charge for insurance; report to Congress</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">In the administration of this section, the Secretary shall establish a premium charge for insurance that will be sufficient to cover the full costs of the mortgage insurance program under this section, except that such charge may not exceed 3 percent per annum of the principal amount of the mortgage outstanding at any time. Not later than September 30, 1984, the Secretary shall determine and report to the Congress on the feasibility of eliminating any excess amount of the premium under this section over the premium under section 1709 of this title. In the event such premiums are not sufficient to cover the full costs of the mortgage insurance program under this section, the Secretary shall make recommendations to the Congress about changes to the program.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(i) &quot;Indian tribe&quot; and &quot;trust or otherwise restricted land&quot; defined</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">For purposes of this section:</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(1) The term &quot;Indian tribe&quot; means any Indian or Alaska native tribe, band, nation, or other organized group or community of Indians or Alaska natives recognized as eligible for the services provided to Indians or Alaska natives by the Secretary of the Interior because of its status as such an entity, or that was an eligible recipient under chapter 67 of title 31, prior to the repeal of such chapter.</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(2) The term &quot;trust or otherwise restricted land&quot; means (A) that area of land, as defined by the Secretary of the Interior, over which an Indian tribe is recognized by the United States as having governmental jurisdiction; (B) land held in trust for the benefit of any Indian tribe or individual or held by any Indian tribe or individual subject to a restriction by the United States against alienation; or (C) land acquired by Alaska natives under the Alaska Native Claims Settlement Act [43 U.S.C. 1601 et seq.] or any other land acquired by Alaska natives pursuant to statute by virtue of their unique status as Alaska natives.</p>

<h3 class="section-head">&sect;1715z&ndash;13a. Loan guarantees for Indian housing</h3>
<!-- field-end:head -->
<!-- field-start:statute -->
<h4 class="subsection-head">(a) Authority</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">To provide access to sources of private financing to Indian families, Indian housing authorities, and Indian tribes, who otherwise could not acquire housing financing because of the unique legal status of Indian lands, the Secretary may guarantee not to exceed 100 percent of the unpaid principal and interest due on any loan eligible under subsection (b) made to an Indian family, Indian housing authority, or Indian tribe.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(b) Eligible loans</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">Loans guaranteed pursuant to this section shall meet the following requirements:</p>
<h4 class="paragraph-head">(1) Eligible borrowers</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">The loans shall be made only to borrowers who are Indian families, Indian housing authorities, or Indian tribes.</p>
<h4 class="paragraph-head">(2) Eligible housing</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">The loan shall be used to construct, acquire, refinance, or rehabilitate 1- to 4-family dwellings that are standard housing and are located on trust land or land located in an Indian or Alaska Native area.</p>
<h4 class="paragraph-head">(3) Security</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">The loan may be secured by any collateral authorized under existing Federal law or applicable State or tribal law.</p>
<h4 class="paragraph-head">(4) Lenders</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">The loan shall be made only by a lender approved by and meeting qualifications established by the Secretary, except that loans otherwise insured or guaranteed by an agency of the Federal Government or made by an organization of Indians from amounts borrowed from the United States shall not be eligible for guarantee under this section. The following lenders are deemed to be approved under this paragraph:</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(A) Any mortgagee approved by the Secretary of Housing and Urban Development for participation in the single family mortgage insurance program under title II of the National Housing Act [12 U.S.C. 1707 et seq.].</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(B) Any lender whose housing loans under chapter 37 of title 38 are automatically guaranteed pursuant to section 1802(d)&#160;<sup><a href="#1715z-13a_1_target" name="1715z-13a_1">1</a></sup> of such title.</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(C) Any lender approved by the Secretary of Agriculture to make guaranteed loans for single family housing under the Housing Act of 1949 [42 U.S.C. 1441 et seq.].</p>

<h4 class="paragraph-head">(5) Terms</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">The loan shall&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(A) be made for a term not exceeding 30 years;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(B) bear interest (exclusive of the guarantee fee under section 404&#160;<sup><a href="#1715z-13a_2_target" name="1715z-13a_2">2</a></sup> and service charges, if any) at a rate agreed upon by the borrower and the lender and determined by the Secretary to be reasonable, which may not exceed the rate generally charged in the area (as determined by the Secretary) for home mortgage loans not guaranteed or insured by any agency or instrumentality of the Federal Government;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(C) involve a principal obligation not exceeding&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-3em">(i) 97.75 percent of the appraised value of the property as of the date the loan is accepted for guarantee (or 98.75 percent if the value of the property is $50,000 or less); and</p>
<p class="statutory-body-3em">(ii) the amount approved by the Secretary under this section; and</p>
<br class="Q04" />
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(D) involve a payment on account of the property (i) in cash or its equivalent, or (ii) through the value of any improvements to the property made through the skilled or unskilled labor of the borrower, as the Secretary shall provide.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(c) Certificate of guarantee</h4>
<h4 class="paragraph-head">(1) Approval process</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">Before the Secretary approves any loan for guarantee under this section, the lender shall submit the application for the loan to the Secretary for examination. If the Secretary approves the loan for guarantee, the Secretary shall issue a certificate under this paragraph as evidence of the guarantee.</p>
<h4 class="paragraph-head">(2) Standard for approval</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">The Secretary may approve a loan for guarantee under this section and issue a certificate under this paragraph only if the Secretary determines there is a reasonable prospect of repayment of the loan.</p>
<h4 class="paragraph-head">(3) Effect</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">A certificate of guarantee issued under this paragraph by the Secretary shall be conclusive evidence of the eligibility of the loan for guarantee under the provisions of this section and the amount of such guarantee. Such evidence shall be incontestable in the hands of the bearer and the full faith and credit of the United States is pledged to the payment of all amounts agreed to be paid by the Secretary as security for such obligations.</p>
<h4 class="paragraph-head">(4) Fraud and misrepresentation</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">This subsection may not be construed to preclude the Secretary from establishing defenses against the original lender based on fraud or material misrepresentation or to bar the Secretary from establishing by regulations in effect on the date of issuance or disbursement, whichever is earlier, partial defenses to the amount payable on the guarantee.</p>
<h4 class="paragraph-head">(5) Trailing documents</h4>
<h4 class="subparagraph-head">(A) In general</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">The Secretary may issue a certificate of guarantee under this subsection for a loan involving a security interest in Indian trust <!-- PDFPage:712 -->land before the Secretary receives the trailing documents required by the Secretary from the Bureau of Indian Affairs, including the final certified title status report showing the recordation by the Bureau of Indian Affairs of the mortgage relating to the loan, if the originating lender agrees to indemnify the Secretary for any losses that may result when&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-3em">(i) a claim payment is presented to the Secretary due to the default of the borrower on the loan; and</p>
<p class="statutory-body-3em">(ii) the required trailing documents are outstanding.</p>
<h4 class="subparagraph-head">(B) Termination of indemnification agreement</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">An indemnification agreement between an originating lender and the Secretary described in subparagraph (A) shall only terminate upon receipt by the Secretary of the trailing documents described in that subparagraph in a form and manner that is acceptable to the Secretary.</p>
<h4 class="subparagraph-head">(C) Rule of construction</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">Nothing in this paragraph shall be construed as authorizing the Bureau of Indian Affairs to delay the issuance of a final certified title status report and recorded mortgage relating to a loan closed on Indian trust land.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(d) Guarantee fee</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">The Secretary shall establish and collect, at the time of issuance of the guarantee, a fee for the guarantee of loans under this section, in an amount not exceeding 3 percent of the principal obligation of the loan. The Secretary may also establish and collect annual premium payments in an amount not exceeding 1 percent of the remaining guaranteed balance (excluding the portion of the remaining balance attributable to the fee collected at the time of issuance of the guarantee). The Secretary shall establish the amount of the fees and premiums by publishing a notice in the Federal Register. The Secretary shall deposit any fees and premiums collected under this subsection in the Indian Housing Loan Guarantee Fund established under subsection (i).</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(e) Liability under guarantee</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">The liability under a guarantee provided under this section shall decrease or increase on a pro rata basis according to any decrease or increase in the amount of the unpaid obligation under the provisions of the loan agreement.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(f) Transfer and assumption</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">Notwithstanding any other provision of law, any loan guaranteed under this section, including the security given for the loan, may be sold or assigned by the lender to any financial institution subject to examination and supervision by an agency of the Federal Government or of any State or the District of Columbia.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(g) Disqualification of lenders and civil money penalties</h4>
<h4 class="paragraph-head">(1) In general</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">If the Secretary determines that any lender or holder of a guarantee certificate under subsection (c) has failed to maintain adequate accounting records, to adequately service loans guaranteed under this section, to exercise proper credit or underwriting judgment, or has engaged in practices otherwise detrimental to the interest of a borrower or the United States, the Secretary may&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(A) refuse, either temporarily or permanently, to guarantee any further loans made by such lender or holder;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(B) bar such lender or holder from acquiring additional loans guaranteed under this section; and</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(C) require that such lender or holder assume not less than 10 percent of any loss on further loans made or held by the lender or holder that are guaranteed under this section.</p>
<h4 class="paragraph-head">(2) Civil money penalties for intentional violations</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">If the Secretary determines that any lender or holder of a guarantee certificate under subsection (c) has intentionally failed to maintain adequate accounting records, to adequately service loans guaranteed under this section, or to exercise proper credit or underwriting judgment, the Secretary may impose a civil money penalty on such lender or holder in the manner and amount provided under section 536 of the National Housing Act [12 U.S.C. 1735f&ndash;14] with respect to mortgagees and lenders under such Act.</p>
<h4 class="paragraph-head">(3) Payment on loans made in good faith</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">Notwithstanding paragraphs (1) and (2), the Secretary may not refuse to pay pursuant to a valid guarantee on loans of a lender or holder barred under this subsection if the loans were previously made in good faith.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(h) Payment under guarantee</h4>
<h4 class="paragraph-head">(1) Lender options</h4>
<h4 class="subparagraph-head">(A) In general</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">In the event of default by the borrower on a loan guaranteed under this section, the holder of the guarantee certificate shall provide written notice of the default to the Secretary. Upon providing such notice, the holder of the guarantee certificate shall be entitled to payment under the guarantee (subject to the provisions of this section) and may proceed to obtain payment in one of the following manners:</p>

<p class="statutory-body">The purpose of this section is to authorize a demonstration mortgage risk-sharing program designed to test the feasibility of entering into risk-sharing contracts with private mortgage insurers and with insured community development financial institutions in order to reduce Government risk and administrative costs, and to speed mortgage processing. The Secretary shall limit the demonstration under this section to not more than four administrative regions of the Department of Housing and Urban Development, and shall assure that the program is in the financial interest of the Government and will not result in loss of employment by any employees of the Department of Housing and Urban Development before the expiration of the 5-year period beginning on December 21, 2000. The aggregate number of mortgages for which risk of nonpayment is shared under this section in any administrative region of the Department of Housing and Urban Development in any fiscal year may not exceed 20 percent of the aggregate number of mortgages and loans insured by the Secretary under this subchapter in such region during the preceding fiscal year.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(b) One- to four-family dwellings; requirements for private mortgage insurance companies</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">Notwithstanding any other provision of this chapter inconsistent with this section, the Secretary is authorized, in providing mortgage insurance with respect to one- to four-family dwellings under sections 1709(b), 1715y, and 1715z&ndash;10&#160;<sup><a href="#1715z-14_1_target" name="1715z-14_1">1</a></sup> of this title, to enter into risk-sharing contracts with private mortgage insurance companies which have been determined to be qualified insurers under section 1717(b)(2)(C) of this title and with insured community development financial institutions.

<h4 class="subsection-head">(c) Required contract provisions</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">Any contract for risk-sharing under this section shall contain such provisions relating to the sharing of premiums received by the Secretary with a private mortgage insurer or insured community development financial institution on a sound actuarial basis, establishment of loss reserves, manner of calculating claims on such risk-sharing contract, conditions with respect to foreclosure, handling and disposition of property prior to claim or settlement, rights of assignees, and other similar matters as the Secretary may prescribe pursuant to regulations. Pursuant to a contract under this section, a private mortgage insurance company or insured community development financial institution shall endorse loans for risk-sharing and take such other actions on behalf of the Secretary and in the Secretary's name as the Secretary may authorize.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(d) Mortgages offered for inclusion by Secretary</h4>

<h4 class="subsection-head">(e) Insured community development financial institution</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">For purposes of this section, the term &quot;insured community development financial institution&quot; means a community development financial institution, as such term is defined in section 4702 of this title that is an insured depository institution (as such term is defined in section 1813 of this title) or an insured credit union (as such term is defined in section 1752 of this title).</p>

<!-- field-end:head -->
<!-- field-start:statute -->
<h4 class="subsection-head">(a) One- to four-family dwellings; maximum term of mortgage; adjustments in effective rate of interest</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">The Secretary may insure under any provision of this subchapter a mortgage involving property upon which there is located a dwelling designed principally for occupancy by one to four families, where the mortgage provides for periodic adjustments by the mortgagee in the effective rate of interest charged. Such interest rate adjustments may be accomplished through adjustments in the monthly payment amount, the outstanding principal balance, or the mortgage term, or a combination of these factors, except that in no case may any extension of a mortgage term result in a total term in excess of 40 years. Adjustments in the effective rate of interest shall correspond to a specified national interest rate index approved in regulations by the Secretary, information on which is readily accessible to mortgagors from generally available published sources. Adjustments in the effective rate of interest shall (1) be made on an annual basis; (2) be limited, with respect to any single interest rate increase, to no more than 1 percent on the outstanding loan balance; and (3) be limited to a maximum increase of 5 percentage points above the initial contract interest rate over the term of the mortgage.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(b) Written explanation of mortgage features</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">The Secretary shall require that the mortgagee make available to the mortgagor, at the time of loan application, a written explanation of the features of an adjustable rate mortgage consistent with the disclosure requirements applicable to variable rate mortgages secured by a principal dwelling under the Truth in Lending Act [15 U.S.C. 1601 et seq.].</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(c) Number of mortgages and loans</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">The aggregate number of mortgages and loans insured under this section in any fiscal year may not exceed 30 percent of the aggregate number of mortgages and loans insured by the Secretary under this subchapter during the preceding fiscal year.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(d) Adjustable rate mortgage with initial fixed rate of interest</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">(1) The Secretary may insure under this subsection a mortgage that meets the requirements of subsection (a), except that the effective rate of interest&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(A) shall be fixed for a period of not less than the first 3 years of the mortgage term;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(B) shall be adjusted by the mortgagee initially upon the expiration of such period and annually thereafter; and</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(C) in the case of the initial interest rate adjustment, is subject to the 1 percent limitation only if the interest rate remained fixed for 3 or fewer years.</p>

<p class="statutory-body">The Secretary shall establish by regulation the maximum percentage of net appreciated value which may be payable to a mortgagee as the mortgagee's share.
