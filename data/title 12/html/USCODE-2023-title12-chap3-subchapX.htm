<p class="note-body"><b>1991</b>&mdash;Subsec. (a). Pub. L. 102&ndash;242 substituted &quot;section 1828(o) of this title and such restrictions and requirements as the Comptroller of the Currency may prescribe by regulation or order&quot; for &quot;such terms, conditions, and limitations as may be prescribed by the Comptroller of the Currency by order, rule, or regulation&quot;.</p>
<p class="note-body"><b>1982</b>&mdash;Subsec. (a). Pub. L. 97&ndash;320 amended subsec. (a) generally. Prior to amendment subsec. (a) read as follows:</p>
<p class="note-body">&quot;(1) Any national banking association may make real estate loans, secured by liens upon unimproved real estate, upon improved real estate, including improved farmland and improved business and residential properties, and upon real estate to be improved by a building or buildings to be constructed or in the process of construction, in an amount which when added to the amount unpaid upon prior mortgages, liens, encumbrances, if any, upon such real estate does not exceed the respective proportions of appraised value as provided in this section. A loan secured by real estate within the meaning of this section shall be in the form of an obligation or obligations secured by a mortgage, trust deed, or other instrument, which shall constitute a lien on real estate in fee or, under such rules and regulations as may be prescribed by the Comptroller of the Currency, on a leasehold under a lease which does not expire for at least ten years beyond the maturity date of the loan, and any national banking association may purchase or sell any obligations so secured in whole or in part. The amount of any such loan hereafter made shall not exceed 662/3 per centum of the appraised value if such real estate is unimproved, 75 per centum of the appraised value if such real estate is improved by offsite improvements such as streets, water, sewers, or other utilities, 75 per centum of the appraised value if such real estate is in the process of being improved by a building or buildings to be constructed or in the process of construction, or 90 per centum of the appraised value if such real estate is improved by a building or buildings. If any such loan exceeds 75 per centum of the appraised value of the real estate or if the real estate is improved with a one- to four-family dwelling, installment payments shall be required which are sufficient to amortize the entire principal of the loan within a period of not more than thirty years.</p>
<p class="note-body">&quot;(2) The limitations and restrictions set forth in paragraph (1) shall not prevent the renewal or extension of loans heretofore made and shall not apply to real estate loans (A) which are insured under the provisions of the National Housing Act [12 U.S.C. 1701 et seq.], (B) which are insured by the Secretary of Agriculture pursuant to title I of the Bankhead-Jones Farm Tenant Act, or the Act of August 28, 1937, as amended, or title V of the Housing Act of 1949, as amended, [42 U.S.C. 1471 et seq.], or (C) which are guaranteed by the Secretary of Housing and Urban Development, for the payment of the obligations of which the full faith and credit of the United States is pledged, and such limitations and restrictions shall not apply to real estate loans which are fully guaranteed or insured by a State, or any agency or instrumentality thereof, or by a State authority for the payment of the obligations of which <!-- PDFPage:137 -->the faith and credit of the State is pledged, if under the terms of the guaranty or insurance agreement the association will be assured of repayment in accordance with the terms of the loan, or to any loan at least 20 per centum of which is guaranteed under chapter 37 of title 38, or to obligations guaranteed under section 1440 of title 42.</p>
<p class="note-body">&quot;(3) Loans which are guaranteed or insured as described in paragraph (2) shall not be taken into account in determining the amount of real estate loans which a national banking association may make in relation to its capital and surplus or its time and savings deposits or in determining, the amount of real estate loans secured by other than first liens. Where the collateral for any loan consists partly of real estate security and partly of other security, including a guaranty or endorsement by or an obligation or commitment of a person other than the borrower, only the amount by which the loan exceeds the value as collateral of such other security shall be considered a loan upon the security of real estate, and in no event shall a loan be considered as a real estate loan where there is a valid and binding agreement which is entered into by a financially responsible lender or other party either directly with the association or which is for the benefit of or has been assigned to the association and pursuant to which agreement the lender or other party is required to advance to the association within sixty months from the date of the making of such loan the full amount of the loan to be made by the association upon the security of real estate. Except as otherwise provided, no such association shall make real estate loans in an aggregate sum in excess of the amount of the capital stock of such association paid in and unimpaired plus the amount of its unimpaired surplus fund, or in excess of the amount of its time and savings deposits, whichever is greater: <i>Provided</i>, That the amount unpaid upon real estate loans secured by other than first liens, when added to the amount unpaid upon prior mortgages, liens, and encumbrances, shall not exceed in an aggregate sum 20 per centum of the amount of the capital stock of such association paid in and unimpaired plus 20 per centum of the amount of its unimpaired surplus fund.&quot;</p>
<p class="note-body">Subsec. (b). Pub. L. 97&ndash;320 redesignated subsec. (d) as (b) and struck out former subsec. (b) &quot;Any national banking association may make real estate loans secured by liens upon forest tracts which are properly managed in all respects. Such loans shall be in the form of an obligation or obligations secured by mortgage, trust deed, or other such instrument; and any national banking association may purchase or sell any obligations so secured in whole or in part. The amount of any such loan, when added to the amount unpaid upon prior mortgages, liens, and encumbrances, if any, shall not exceed 662/3 per centum of the appraised fair market value of the growing timber, lands, and improvements thereon offered as security and the loan shall be made upon such terms and conditions as to assure that at no time shall the loan balance, when added to the amount unpaid upon prior mortgages, liens, and encumbrances, if any, exceed 662/3 per centum of the original appraised total value of the property then remaining. No such loan shall be made for a longer term than three years; except that any such loan may be made for a term not longer than fifteen years if the loan is secured by an amortized mortgage, deed of trust, or other such instrument under the terms of which the installment payments are sufficient to amortize the principal of the loan within a period of not more than fifteen years and at a rate at least 62/3 per centum per annum. All such loans secured by liens upon forest tracts shall be included in the permissible aggregate of all real estate loans and, when secured by other than first liens, in the permissible aggregate of all real estate loans secured by other than first liens, prescribed in subsection (a) of this section, but no national banking association shall make forest tract loans in an aggregate sum in excess of 50 per centum of its capital stock paid in and unimpaired plus 50 per centum of its unimpaired surplus fund.&quot;</p>

<p class="note-body">Subsec. (f). Pub. L. 97&ndash;320 struck out subsec. (f) &quot;Any national banking association may make loans upon the security of real estate that do not comply with the limitations and restrictions in this section, if the total unpaid amount loaned, exclusive of loans which subsequently comply with such limitations and restrictions, does not exceed 10 per centum of the amount that a national banking association may invest in real estate loans.

No executive officer of any member bank may become indebted to that member bank except by means of an extension of credit which the bank is authorized to make under this section. Any extension of credit under this section shall be promptly reported to the board of directors of the bank, and may be made only if&mdash;</p>

<p class="statutory-body-1em">(C) the officer has submitted a detailed current financial statement; and</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(D) it is on condition that it shall become due and payable on demand of the bank at any time when the officer is indebted to any other bank or banks on account of extensions of credit of any one of the three categories respectively referred to in paragraphs (2), (3), and (4) in an aggregate amount greater than the amount of credit of the same category that could be extended to him by the bank of which he is an officer.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(2) Mortgage loans</h4>

<p class="statutory-body-1em">(B) no other loan by the bank to the officer under authority of this paragraph is outstanding.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(3) Educational loans</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">A member bank may make extensions of credit to any executive officer of the bank to finance the education of the children of the officer.</p>

<p class="statutory-body">Except to the extent permitted under paragraph (4), a member bank may not extend credit to a partnership in which one or more of its executive officers are partners having either individually or together a majority interest.

<h4 class="subsection-head">(6) Endorsement or guarantee of loans or assets; protective indebtedness</h4>

<h4 class="subsection-head">(7) Continuation of violation</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">Each day that any extension of credit in violation of this section exists is a continuation of the violation for the purposes of section 1818 of this title.</p>

<h3 class="section-head">&sect;375b. Extensions of credit to executive officers, directors, and principal shareholders of member banks</h3>
<!-- field-end:head -->
<!-- field-start:statute -->
<h4 class="subsection-head">(1) In general</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">No member bank may extend credit to any of its executive officers, directors, or principal shareholders, or to any related interest of such a person, except to the extent permitted under paragraphs (2), (3), (4), (5), and (6).</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(2) Preferential terms prohibited</h4>
<h4 class="paragraph-head">(A) In general</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">A member bank may extend credit to its executive officers, directors, or principal shareholders, or to any related interest of such a person, only if the extension of credit&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(i) is made on substantially the same terms, including interest rates and collateral, as those prevailing at the time for comparable transactions by the bank with persons who are not executive officers, directors, principal shareholders, or employees of the bank;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(ii) does not involve more than the normal risk of repayment or present other unfavorable features; and</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(iii) the bank follows credit underwriting procedures that are not less stringent than those applicable to comparable transactions by the bank with persons who are not executive officers, directors, principal shareholders, or employees of the bank.</p>
<h4 class="paragraph-head">(B) Exception</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">Nothing in this paragraph shall prohibit any extension of credit made pursuant to a benefit or compensation program&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(i) that is widely available to employees of the member bank; and</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(ii) that does not give preference to any officer, director, or principal shareholder of the member bank, or to any related interest of such person, over other employees of the member bank.</p>
<!-- PDFPage:153 --><h4 class="subsection-head">(3) Prior approval required</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">A member bank may extend credit to a person described in paragraph (1) in an amount that, when aggregated with the amount of all other outstanding extensions of credit by that bank to each such person and that person's related interests, would exceed an amount prescribed by regulation of the appropriate Federal banking agency (as defined in section 1813 of this title) only if&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(A) the extension of credit has been approved in advance by a majority vote of that bank's entire board of directors; and</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(B) the interested party has abstained from participating, directly or indirectly, in the deliberations or voting on the extension of credit.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(4) Aggregate limit on extensions of credit to any executive officer, director, or principal shareholder</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">A member bank may extend credit to any executive officer, director, or principal shareholder, or to any related interest of such a person, only if the extension of credit is in an amount that, when aggregated with the amount of all outstanding extensions of credit by that bank to that person and that person's related interests, would not exceed the limits on loans to a single borrower established by section 84 of this title. For purposes of this paragraph, section 84 of this title shall be deemed to apply to a State member bank as if the State member bank were a national banking association.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(5) Aggregate limit on extensions of credit to all executive officers, directors, and principal shareholders</h4>
<h4 class="paragraph-head">(A) In general</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">A member bank may extend credit to any executive officer, director, or principal shareholder, or to any related interest of such a person, if the extension of credit is in an amount that, when aggregated with the amount of all outstanding extensions of credit by that bank to its executive officers, directors, principal shareholders, and those persons&apos; related interests would not exceed the bank's unimpaired capital and unimpaired surplus.</p>
<h4 class="paragraph-head">(B) More stringent limit authorized</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">The Board may, by regulation, prescribe a limit that is more stringent than that contained in subparagraph (A).</p>
<h4 class="paragraph-head">(C) Board may make exceptions for certain banks</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">The Board may, by regulation, make exceptions to subparagraph (A) for member banks with less than $100,000,000 in deposits if the Board determines that the exceptions are important to avoid constricting the availability of credit in small communities or to attract directors to such banks. In no case may the aggregate amount of all outstanding extensions of credit to a bank's executive officers, directors, principal shareholders, and those persons&apos; related interests be more than 2 times the bank's unimpaired capital and unimpaired surplus.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(6) Overdrafts by executive officers and directors prohibited</h4>
<h4 class="paragraph-head">(A) In general</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">If any executive officer or director has an account at the member bank, the bank may not pay on behalf of that person an amount exceeding the funds on deposit in the account.</p>
<h4 class="paragraph-head">(B) Exceptions</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">Subparagraph (A) does not prohibit a member bank from paying funds in accordance with&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(i) a written preauthorized, interest-bearing extension of credit specifying a method of repayment; or</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(ii) a written preauthorized transfer of funds from another account of the executive officer or director at that bank.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(7) Prohibition on knowingly receiving unauthorized extension of credit</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">No executive officer, director, or principal shareholder shall knowingly receive (or knowingly permit any of that person's related interests to receive) from a member bank, directly or indirectly, any extension of credit not authorized under this section.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(8) Executive officer, director, or principal shareholder of certain affiliates treated as executive officer, director, or principal shareholder of member bank</h4>
<h4 class="paragraph-head">(A) In general</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">For purposes of this section, any executive officer, director, or principal shareholder (as the case may be) of any company of which the member bank is a subsidiary, or of any other subsidiary of that company, shall be deemed to be an executive officer, director, or principal shareholder (as the case may be) of the member bank.</p>
<h4 class="paragraph-head">(B) Exception</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">The Board may, by regulation, make exceptions to subparagraph (A) for any executive officer or director of a subsidiary of a company that controls the member bank if&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(i) the executive officer or director does not have authority to participate, and does not participate, in major policymaking functions of the member bank; and</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(ii) the assets of such subsidiary do not exceed 10 percent of the consolidated assets of a company that controls the member bank and such subsidiary (and is not controlled by any other company).</p>
