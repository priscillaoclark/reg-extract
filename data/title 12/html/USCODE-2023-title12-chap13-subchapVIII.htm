<h3 class="section-head">&sect;1748b. Insurance of mortgages</h3>
<!-- field-end:head -->
<!-- field-start:statute -->
<h4 class="subsection-head">(a) Aggregate amount of insurance; termination date</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">In order to assist in relieving the acute shortage and urgent need for family housing which now exists at or in areas adjacent to military installations because of uncertainty as to the permanency of such installations and to increase the supply of necessary family housing accommodations for personnel at such installations, the Secretary is authorized, upon application of the mortgagee, to insure mortgages (including advances on such mortgages during construction) which are eligible for insurance as hereinafter provided, and, upon such terms as the Secretary may prescribe, to make commitments for so insuring such mortgages prior to the date of their execution or disbursement thereon: <i>Provided</i>, That the aggregate amount of principal obligations of all mortgages insured under this subchapter (except mortgages insured pursuant to the provisions of this subchapter in effect prior to August 11, 1955) shall not exceed $2,300,000,000: <i>And provided further</i>, That the limitation in section 1715h of this title shall not apply to this subchapter: <i>And provided further</i>, That no more mortgages shall be insured under this section after October 1, 1962, except pursuant to a commitment to insure before such date, and not more than twenty-eight thousand family housing units shall be contracted for after June 30, 1959, pursuant to any mortgage insured under this section after such date.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(b) Eligibility for insurance</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">To be eligible for insurance under this subchapter a mortgage shall meet the following conditions:</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(1) The mortgaged property shall be held by a mortgagor approved by the Secretary. The Secretary may, in his discretion, require such mortgagor to be regulated or restricted as to capital structure, and methods of operation. The Secretary may make such contracts with, and acquire for not to exceed $100 stock or interest in, any such mortgagor, as the Secretary may deem necessary to render effective such restriction or regulation. Such stock or interest shall be paid for out of the General Insurance Fund, and shall be redeemed by the mortgagor at par upon the termination of all <!-- PDFPage:828 -->obligations of the Secretary under the insurance.</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(2) The mortgaged property shall be designed for use for residential purposes by personnel of the armed services and situated at or near a military installation, and the Secretary of Defense or his designee shall have certified that there is no intention, so far as can reasonably be foreseen, to substantially curtail the personnel assigned or to be assigned to such installation, and (i) shall have determined that for reasons of safety, security, or other essential military requirements, it is necessary that the personnel involved reside in public quarters: <i>Provided, however</i>, That for the purposes of this subsection housing covered by a mortgage insured, or for which a commitment to insure has been issued, under this section prior to August 11, 1955, may be considered the same as available quarters, and (ii) with the approval of the Secretary, shall have determined that adequate housing is not available for such personnel at reasonable rentals within reasonable commuting distance of the installation and that the mortgaged property will not, so far as can reasonably be foreseen, substantially curtail occupancy in existing housing covered by mortgages insured under this chapter. The housing accommodations shall comply with such standards and conditions as the Secretary may prescribe to establish the acceptability of such property for mortgage insurance, except that the certification of the Secretary of Defense or his designee shall (for purposes of mortgage insurance under this subchapter) be conclusive evidence to the Secretary of the existence of the need for such housing. However, if the Secretary does not concur in the housing needs as certified by the Secretary of Defense, the Secretary may require the Secretary of Defense to guarantee the General Insurance Fund against loss with respect to the mortgage covering such housing. There are authorized to be appropriated such sums as may be necessary to provide for payment to meet losses arising from such guaranty.</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(3) The mortgage shall involve a principal obligation in an amount&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(A) not to exceed the amount which the Secretary estimates will be the replacement cost of the property or project when the proposed improvements are completed (the cost of the property or project as such term is used in this paragraph may include the cost of the land, the physical improvements, and utilities within the boundaries of the property or project);</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(B) not to exceed an average of $16,500 per family unit for such part of such property or project (including ranges, refrigerators, shades, screens, and fixtures) as may be attributable to dwelling use: <i>Provided</i>, That the replacement cost of the property or project as determined by the Secretary, including the estimated value of any usable utilities within the boundaries of the property or project where owned by the United States and not provided for out of the proceeds of the mortgage, shall not exceed an average of $16,500 per family unit: <i>Provided further</i>, That should the financing of housing to be constructed pursuant to a single invitation for bids be accomplished by two or more mortgages, the principal obligation of any single mortgage may exceed an average of $16,500 per family unit if the sum of the principal obligations of all mortgages for such housing does not exceed an average of $16,500 per family unit: <i>And provided further</i>, That subject to the limitations of this paragraph no family unit included in any mortgaged property shall be contracted for after June 8, 1960 if the cost of such unit exceeds $19,800; and</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(C) not to exceed the bid of the eligible bidder with respect to the property or project under section 1594 of title 42.</p>
<br class="Q04" />
<p class="statutory-body-block">The mortgage shall provide for complete amortization by periodic payments within such terms as the Secretary shall prescribe, but not to exceed thirty years from the beginning of amortization of the mortgage, and shall bear interest (exclusive of premium charges for insurance) as not to exceed 4&#189; per centum per annum of the amount of the principal obligation outstanding at any time. The Secretary may consent to the release of a part or parts of the mortgaged property from the lien of the mortgage upon such terms and conditions as he may prescribe and the mortgage may provide for such release. The property or project may include such nondwelling facilities as the Secretary deems adequate to serve the occupants.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(c) Premium charges</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">The Secretary is authorized to fix a premium charge for the insurance of mortgages under this subchapter but in the case of any mortgage such charge shall not be less than an amount equivalent to one-half of 1 per centum per annum nor more than an amount equivalent to 1&#189; per centum per annum of the amount of the principal obligation of the mortgage outstanding at any time, without taking into account delinquent payments or prepayments. Such premium charges shall be payable by the mortgagee, either in cash, or in debentures issued by the Secretary under this subchapter at par plus accrued interest, in such manner as may be prescribed by the Secretary: <i>Provided</i>, That the Secretary may require the payment of one or more such premium charges at the time the mortgage is insured, at such discount rate as he may prescribe not in excess of the interest rate specified in the mortgage. If the Secretary finds, upon the presentation of a mortgage for insurance and the tender of the initial premium charge and such other charges as the Secretary may require, that the mortgage complies with the provisions of this subchapter, such mortgage may be accepted for insurance by endorsement or otherwise as the Secretary may prescribe. In the event that the principal obligation of any mortgage accepted for insurance under this subchapter is paid in full prior to the maturity date, the Secretary is authorized to refund to the mortgagee for the account of the mortgagor all, or such portion as he shall determine to be equitable, of the current unearned premium charges theretofore paid. The Secretary may reduce the payment of premiums provided for <!-- PDFPage:829 -->herein. The Secretary is further authorized to reduce the amount of the premium charge below one-half of 1 per centum per annum with respect to any mortgage on property acquired by the Secretary of Defense or his designee if the mortgage is insured pursuant to the provisions of this subchapter as in effect prior to August 11, 1955.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(d) Default by mortgagor; rights of mortgagee</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">The failure of the mortgagor to make any payment due under or provided to be paid by the terms of a mortgage insured under this subchapter shall be considered a default under such mortgage, and, if such default continues for a period of thirty days, the mortgagee shall be entitled to receive the benefits of the insurance as hereinafter provided, upon assignment, transfer, and delivery to the Secretary, within a period and in accordance with rules and regulations to be prescribed by the Secretary of (1) all rights and interest arising under the mortgage so in default; (2) all claims of the mortgagee against the mortgagor or others, arising out of the mortgage transactions; (3) all policies of title or other insurance or surety bonds or other guaranties and any and all claims thereunder; (4) any balance of the mortgage loan not advanced to the mortgagor; (5) any cash or property held by the mortgagee, or to which it is entitled, as deposits made for the account of the mortgagor and which have not been applied in reduction of the principal of the mortgage indebtedness; and (6) all records, documents, books, papers, and accounts relating to the mortgage transaction. Upon such assignment, transfer, and delivery, the obligation of the mortgagee to pay the premium charges for mortgage insurance shall cease, and the Secretary shall, subject to the cash adjustment provided for in subsection (e) of this section, issue to the mortgagee debentures having a total face value equal to the value of the mortgage, and a certificate of claim as hereinafter provided. For the purposes of this subsection, the value of the mortgage shall be determined in accordance with rules and regulations prescribed by the Secretary, by adding to the amount of the original principal obligation of the mortgage which was unpaid on the date of default, the amount the mortgagee may have paid for (A) taxes, special assessments, and water rates, which are liens prior to the mortgage; (B) insurance on the property; and (C) reasonable expenses for the completion and preservation of the property and any mortgage insurance premiums paid after default; less the sum of (i) any amount received on account of the mortgage after such date; and (ii) any net income received by the mortgagee from the property after such date.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(e) Debentures; issuance; form and denomination</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">Debentures issued under this subchapter shall be in such form and denominations in multiples of $50, shall be subject to such terms and conditions, and shall include such provisions for redemption, if any, as may be prescribed by the Secretary, with the approval of the Secretary of the Treasury, and may be in coupon or registered form. Any difference between the value of the mortgage determined as herein provided and the aggregate face value of the debentures issued, not to exceed $50, shall be adjusted by the payment of cash by the Secretary to the mortgagee from the General Insurance Fund.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(f) Debentures; execution; signature; negotiability; interest rate; tax exemption; guarantee</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">Debentures issued under this subchapter shall be executed in the name of the General Insurance Fund as obligor, shall be signed by the Secretary, by either his written or engraved signature, and shall be negotiable. All such debentures shall be dated as of the date of default as determined in accordance with subsection (d) of this section, and shall bear interest from such date at a rate established by the Secretary pursuant to section 1715o of this title, payable semiannually on the 1st day of January and the 1st day of July of each year, and shall mature twenty years after the date thereof. Such debentures shall be exempt, both as to principal and interest, from all taxation (except surtaxes, estate, inheritance, and gift taxes) now or hereafter imposed by any Territory, dependency, or possession of the United States or by the District of Columbia, or by any State, county, municipality, or local taxing authority. They shall be paid out of the General Insurance Fund, which shall be primarily liable therefor, and they shall be fully and unconditionally guaranteed as to principal and interest by the United States, and such guaranty shall be expressed on the face of the debentures. In the event the General Insurance Fund fails to pay upon demand, when due, the principal of or interest on any debentures so guaranteed, the Secretary of the Treasury shall pay to the holders the amount thereof which is authorized to be appropriated, and thereupon to the extent of the amount so paid the Secretary of the Treasury shall succeed to all the rights of the holders of such debentures.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(g) Claim certificates</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">The certificate of claim issued by the Secretary to any mortgagee in connection with the insurance of mortgages under this subchapter shall be for an amount determined in accordance with subsections (e) and (f) of section 1739 of this title, except that any amount remaining after the payment of the full amount under the certificate of claim shall be retained by the Secretary and credited to the General Insurance Fund.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(h) Laws applicable</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">The provisions of section 1713(k) and (l) of this title shall be applicable to mortgages insured under this subchapter and to property acquired by the Secretary hereunder, except that as applied to such mortgages and property, the reference in section 1713(k) of this title to subsection (g) shall be construed to refer to subsection (d) of this section.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(i) Secretary's additional powers to insure certain mortgages</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">The Secretary shall also have power to insure under this subchapter or subchapter II any mortgage executed in connection with the sale by him of any property acquired under this subchapter without regard to any limit as to eligibility, time or aggregate amount contained in this subchapter or subchapter II.</p>
<!-- PDFPage:830 --><h4 class="subsection-head">(j) Conclusiveness and validity of insurance contract</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">Any contract of insurance executed by the Secretary under this subchapter shall be conclusive evidence of the eligibility of the mortgage for insurance and the validity of any contract of insurance so executed shall be incontestable in the hands of an approved mortgagee from the date of the execution of such contract, except for fraud or misrepresentation on the part of such approved mortgagee.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(k) Certification as to overtime wages paid to laborers and mechanics</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">The Secretary shall not insure any mortgage under this section unless the principal contractor or contractors engaged in the construction of the project involved file a certificate or certificates (at such times, in the course of construction or otherwise, as the Secretary may prescribe) certifying that the laborers and mechanics employed in the construction of such project have been paid not less than one and one-half times the regular rate of pay for employment in excess of eight hours in any one day or in excess of forty hours in any one week.</p>

Such certification shall be conclusive evidence to the Secretary of the need for such housing but if the Secretary determines that insurance of mortgages on such housing is not an acceptable risk, he may require the Secretary of Defense to guarantee the General Insurance Fund from loss with respect to mortgages insured pursuant to this section: <i>Provided</i>, That the Secretary shall relieve the Secretary of Defense from any obligation to guarantee the General Insurance Fund from loss with respect to a mortgage assumed by a person ineligible to receive a certificate under subsection (a), if the original mortgagor is issued another certificate with respect to a mortgage insured under this section on property which the Secretary determines is not an acceptable risk.

<!-- field-end:head -->
<!-- field-start:statute -->
<h4 class="subsection-head">(a) Authorization</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">Notwithstanding any other provision of this subchapter, the Secretary may insure and make commitments to insure any mortgage under this section which meets the eligibility requirements hereinafter set forth.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(b) Eligibility requirements</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">No mortgage shall be insured under this section unless (1) the housing which is covered by the insured mortgage is necessary in the interest of national security in order to provide adequate housing for (A) military personnel and essential civilian personnel serving or employed in connection with any installation of one of the armed services of the United States, or (B) essential personnel employed or assigned to duty at or in connection with any research or development installation of the National Aeronautics and Space Administration or of the Atomic Energy Commission, (2) there is no present intention to curtail substantially the number of such personnel assigned or to be assigned to the installation, (3) adequate housing is not available for such personnel at reasonable rentals within reasonable commuting distances of such installation, and (4) the mortgaged property will not so far as can be reasonably foreseen substantially curtail occupancy in any existing housing in the vicinity of the installation which is covered by mortgages insured under this chapter.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(c) Economical soundness of property or project</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">The Secretary may accept any mortgage for insurance under this section without regard to any requirement in any other section of this chapter that the property or project be economically sound.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(d) Rental conditions; preferences and priorities in the sale or rental of dwellings</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">The Secretary shall require each project covered by a mortgage insured under this section to be held for rental for a period of not less than five years after the project or dwelling is made available for initial occupancy or until he finds that the housing may be released from such rental condition. The Secretary shall prescribe such procedures as in his judgment are necessary to secure reasonable preference or priority in the sale or rental of dwellings covered by a mortgage insured under this section for military personnel and essential civilian employees of the armed services, employees of contractors for the armed services, and persons described in clause (1)(B) of subsection (b) of this section.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(e) Property held by mortgagor approved by Secretary; acquisition of stock or interest; redemption</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">For the purpose of providing multifamily rental housing projects or housing projects consisting of individual single-family dwellings for sale, the Secretary is authorized to insure mortgages (including advances on such mortgages during construction) which cover property held by a mortgagor approved by the Secretary. Any such mortgagor shall possess powers necessary therefor and incidental thereto and shall until the termination of all obligations of the Secretary under such insurance be regulated or restricted as to rents or sales, charges, capital structure, rate of return, and methods of operation to such extent and in such manner as to provide reasonable rentals to tenants and a reasonable return on the investment. The Secretary may make such contracts with, and acquire for not to exceed $100 such stock or interest in, any such mortgagor as he may deem necessary to render effective such restriction or regulation. Such stock or interest shall be paid for out of the General Insurance Fund, and shall be redeemed by the mortgagor at par upon the termination of all obligations of the Secretary under the insurance.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(f) Mortgage limitations for multifamily rental property or project</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">To be eligible for insurance under this section, a mortgage on any multifamily rental property or project shall involve a principal obligation in an amount not to exceed, for such part of such property or project as may be attributable to dwelling use, $9,000 per family unit without a bedroom, $12,500 per family unit with one bedroom, $15,000 per family unit with two bedrooms, and $18,500 per family unit with three or more bedrooms, and not to exceed 90 per centum of the estimated value of the property or project when the proposed physical improvements are completed. The Secretary may, by regulation, increase any of the foregoing dollar amount limitations contained in this paragraph by not to exceed 45 per centum in any geographical area where he finds that cost levels so require.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(g) Mortgage limitation for property or project constructed for eventual sale of single-family dwellings</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">To be eligible for insurance under this section a mortgage on any property or project constructed for eventual sale of single-family dwellings shall involve a principal obligation in an amount not to exceed a sum computed on the <!-- PDFPage:836 -->basis of a separate mortgage for each single-family dwelling (irrespective of whether such dwelling has a party wall or is otherwise physically connected with another dwelling or dwellings) comprising the property or project equal to the total of each of the maximum principal obligations of such mortgages which would meet the requirements of section 1709(b)(2) of this title if the mortgagor were the owner and occupant who had made the required payment on account of the property prescribed in such paragraph.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(h) Amortization; interest; release of part of mortgaged property from lien; replacement of certain mortgages by individual mortgages; commercial and community facilities</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">Any mortgage insured under this section shall provide for complete amortization by periodic payments within such terms as the Secretary may prescribe but not to exceed the maximum term applicable to mortgages under section 1713 of this title and shall bear interest at such rate as may be agreed upon by the mortgagor and the mortgagee, except that individual mortgages of the character described in subsection (g) covering the individual dwellings in the project may have a term not in excess of the maximum term applicable to mortgages insured under section 1709 of this title or the unexpired term of the project mortgage at the time of the release of the mortgaged property from such project mortgage, whichever is the greater, and shall bear interest at such rate as may be agreed upon by the mortgagor and the mortgagee. The Secretary may consent to the release of a part or parts of the mortgaged property from the lien of the mortgage upon such terms and conditions as he may prescribe and the mortgage may provide for such release, and a mortgage of the character described in subsection (g) of this section may provide that, at any time after the release of the project from the rental period prescribed by subsection (d), such mortgage may be replaced, in whole or in part, by individual mortgages covering each individual dwelling in the project in amounts not to exceed the unpaid balance of the blanket mortgage allocable to the individual property. Each such individual mortgage may be insured under this section. Property covered by a mortgage insured under this section may include eight or more family units and may include such commercial and community facilities as the Secretary deems adequate to serve the occupants.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(i) Limitation on aggregate number of dwelling units</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">The aggregate number of dwelling units (including all units in multifamily projects or individual dwellings) covered by outstanding commitments to insure and mortgages insured under this section shall at no time exceed five thousand dwelling units.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(j) Applicability of other laws</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">The provisions of subsections (d), (e), (g), (h), (i), (j), (k), (l), and (n) of section 1713 of this title shall be applicable to mortgages insured under this section except individual mortgages of the character described in subsection (g) of this section covering the individual dwellings in the project, and as to such individual mortgages the provisions of subsections (a), (c), (d), (e), (f), (g), (h),<sup><a href="#1748h-2_1_target" name="1748h-2_1">1</a></sup> (j), and (k)&#160;<sup><a href="#1748h-2_1_target" name="1748h-2_1">1</a></sup> of section 1710 of this title shall be applicable: <i>Provided</i>, That wherever the words &quot;Fund&quot; or &quot;Mutual Mortgage Insurance Fund&quot; appear in section 1710 of this title, such reference shall refer to the General Insurance Fund with respect to mortgages insured under this section.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(k) Aggregate amount of mortgages insured; termination date</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">The provisions of sections 1748, 1748a,<sup><a href="#1748h-2_1_target" name="1748h-2_1">1</a></sup> 1748b(c), 1748b(i), 1748b(j), 1748c(a), 1748c(b),<sup><a href="#1748h-2_1_target" name="1748h-2_1">1</a></sup> and 1748f of this title and the provisions of section 1748b(a) of this title relating to the aggregate amount of all mortgages insured under this subchapter shall be applicable to mortgages insured under this section.</p>

<p class="statutory-body">(a) The Secretary is authorized to make payments in lieu of taxes on any real property to which title has been or is hereafter acquired by him in fee under section 1748b of this title as effective prior to August 11, 1955, and on which taxes or payments in lieu of such taxes were payable or paid prior to acquisition by the Secretary. Such payments may be made in connection with tax years occurring prior to or subsequent to October 5, 1962. The amount of any such payments shall not exceed taxes on similar property and shall not include interest or penalties. If the Secretary has acquired or hereafter acquires title in fee to real property by foreclosure or by transfer from some other department or agency of the Government or otherwise during a tax year, he may make a payment in lieu of taxes prorated for that portion of the year remaining after his acquisition of title. This subsection shall not authorize any lien against property held by the Secretary, nor the payment of any tax, nor any payment in lieu of any tax, on any interest of the Secretary as lessee or mortgagee.</p>
