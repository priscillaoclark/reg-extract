<h4 class="subsection-head">(a) Authorization for periodic assistance payments to mortgagees; assistance to manufactured home buyers</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">(1) For the purpose of assisting lower income families in acquiring homeownership or in acquiring membership in a cooperative association operating a housing project, the Secretary is authorized to make, and to contract to make, periodic assistance payments on behalf of such homeowners and cooperative members. The assistance shall be accomplished through payments to mortgagees holding mortgages meeting the special requirements specified in this section or which mortgages are assisted under a State or local program providing assistance through loans, loan insurance or tax abatement. In making such assistance available, the Secretary shall give preference to low-income families who, without such assistance, would be likely to be involuntarily displaced (including those who would be likely to be displaced from rental units which are to be converted into a condominium project or a cooperative project). Such assistance may include the acquisition of a condominium or a membership in a cooperative association.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(2)(A) Notwithstanding any other provision of this section, the Secretary is authorized to make periodic assistance payments under this section on behalf of families whose incomes do not exceed the maximum income limits prescribed pursuant to subsection (h)(2) of this section for the purpose of assisting such families in acquiring ownership of a manufactured home consisting of two or more modules and a lot on which such manufactured home is or will be situated, except that periodic assistance payments pursuant to this paragraph shall not be made with respect to more than 20 per centum of the total number of units with respect to which assistance is approved under this section after January 1, 1976. Assistance payments under this section pursuant to this paragraph shall be accomplished through payments on behalf of an owner of lower-income of a manufactured home as described in the preceding sentence to the financial institution which makes the loan, advance of credit, or purchase of an obligation representing the loan or advance of credit to finance the purchase of the manufactured home and the lot on which such manufactured home is or will be situated, but only if insurance under section 1703 of this title covering such loan, advance of credit, or obligation has been granted to such institution.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(B) Notwithstanding the provisions of subsection (c) of this section, assistance payments provided pursuant to this paragraph shall be in an amount not exceeding the lesser of&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(i) the balance of the monthly payment for principal, interest, real and personal property taxes, insurance, and insurance premium chargeable under section 1703 of this title due under the loan or advance of credit remaining unpaid after applying 20 per centum of the manufactured homeowner's income; or</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(ii) the difference between the amount of the monthly payment for principal, interest, and insurance premium chargeable under section 1703 of this title which the manufactured homeowner is obligated to pay under the loan or advance of credit and the monthly payment of principal and interest which the owner would be obligated to pay if the loan or advance of credit were to bear interest at a rate derived by subtracting from the interest rate applicable to such loan or advance of credit the interest rate differential between the maximum interest rate plus mortgage insurance premium applicable to mortgages insured under subsection (i) of this section at the time such loan or advance of credit is made and the interest rate which such mortgages are presumed, under regulations prescribed by the Secretary, to bear for purposes of subsection (c)(2) of this section.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(b) Qualifications and eligibility requirements for assistance payments</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">To qualify for assistance payments, the homeowner or the cooperative member shall be of lower income and satisfy eligibility requirements prescribed by the Secretary, and&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(1) the homeowner shall be a mortgagor under a mortgage which meets the requirements of and is insured under subsection (i) or (j)(4) of this section: <i>Provided</i>, That a mortgage meeting the requirements of subsection (i)(3)(A) of this section but insured under section 1715z&ndash;2 of this title may qualify for assistance payments if such mortgage was executed by a mortgagor who is determined not to be an acceptable credit risk for mortgage insurance purposes (but otherwise eligible) under subsection (j)(4) of this section or under section 1715l(d)(2) or 1715y(c) of this title and accepted <!-- PDFPage:656 -->as a reasonably satisfactory credit risk under section 1715z&ndash;2&#160;<sup><a href="#1715z_1_target" name="1715z_1">1</a></sup> of this title; or</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(2) the cooperative association of which the family is a member shall operate (A) a housing project the construction or substantial rehabilitation of which has been financed with a mortgage insured under section 1715e or section 1715l(d)(3) of this title and which has been completed within two years prior to the filing of the application for assistance payments and the dwelling unit has had no previous occupant other than the family: <i>Provided</i>, That if any cooperative member who has received assistance payments transfers his membership and occupancy rights to another person who satisfies the eligibility requirements prescribed by the Secretary and undertakes the obligation to pay occupancy charges, the new cooperative member may qualify for assistance payments upon the filing of an application with respect to the dwelling unit involved to be occupied by him: <i>Provided further</i>, That assistance payments may be made with respect to a dwelling unit in an existing cooperative project which meets such standards as the Secretary may prescribe, if the family qualifies as a displaced family as defined in section 1715l(f) of this title, or a family which includes five or more minor persons, or a family occupying low-rent public housing: <i>Provided further</i>, That the amount of the mortgage attributable to the dwelling unit shall involve a principal obligation not in excess of $40,000 ($47,500 in any geographical area where the Secretary authorizes an increase on the basis of a finding that costs levels so require), except that with respect to any family with five or more persons the foregoing limits shall be $47,500 and $55,000, respectively; or (B) a housing project which is financed under a State or local program providing assistance through loans, loan insurance, or tax abatements, and which prior to completion of construction or rehabilitation is approved for receiving the benefits of this section.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(c) Limitation on payments on behalf of mortgagor; occupancy of property; maximum amount of payment; recapture of amounts; determination, applicability, etc.</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">(1) Subject to the second sentence of this paragraph, the assistance payments to a mortgagee by the Secretary on behalf of a mortgagor shall be made during such time as the mortgagor shall continue to occupy the property which secures the mortgage: <i>Provided</i>, That assistance payments may be made on behalf of a homeowner who assumes a mortgage insured under subsection (i) or (j)(4) with respect to which assistance payments have been made on behalf of the previous owner, if the homeowner is approved by the Secretary as eligible for receiving such assistance: <i>Provided further</i>, That the Secretary is authorized to continue making such assistance payments where the mortgage has been assigned to the Secretary. Assistance payments pursuant to any new contract, other than a contract in connection with a refinancing under subsection (r), entered into after September 30, 1983, that utilizes authority approved in appropriation Acts for any fiscal year beginning after such date may not be made for more than a 10-year period. The payment shall be in an amount not exceeding the lesser of&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(A) the balance of the monthly payment for principal, interest, taxes, insurance, and mortgage insurance premium due under the mortgage remaining unpaid after applying 20 per centum of the mortgagor's income; or</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(B) the difference between the amount of the monthly payment for principal, interest and mortgage insurance premium which the mortgagor is obligated to pay under the mortgage and the monthly payment for principal and interest which the mortgagor would be obligated to pay if the mortgage were to bear interest at the rate of 1 per centum per annum (4 per centum per annum in the case of a mortgage described in subsection (o)).</p>
<br class="Q04" />
<p class="statutory-body">(2)(A) Upon disposition by the homeowner of any property assisted pursuant to this section or where the homeowner rents such a property (or the owner's unit in the case of a two- to four-family property) for a period longer than one year, the Secretary shall provide for the recapture of an amount equal to the lesser of (i) the amount of assistance actually received under this section, other than any amount provided under subsection (e), or (ii) an amount equal to at least 50 per centum of the net appreciation of the property, as determined by the Secretary. For the purpose of this paragraph, the term &quot;net appreciation of the property&quot; means any increase in the value of the property over the original purchase price, less the reasonable costs of sale, the reasonable costs of improvements made to the property, and any increase in the mortgage amount as of the time of sale over the original mortgage balance due to the mortgage being insured pursuant to section 1715z&ndash;10&#160;<sup><a href="#1715z_1_target" name="1715z_1">1</a></sup> of this title. Notwithstanding any other provision of law, any such assistance shall constitute a debt secured by the property to the extent that the Secretary may provide for such recapture.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(B) Subparagraph (A) does not apply to any property with respect to which there is assumption in accordance with paragraph (1) of this subsection or to any property which is subject to a mortgage, loan, or other advance of credit insured pursuant to subsection (q).</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(3)(A) There hereby is established in the Treasury of the United States a fund, which, to the extent approved in appropriation Acts, may be used by the Secretary for purposes of carrying out subparagraph (B). There shall be deposited into such fund (i) any amount recaptured under paragraph (2); (ii) any authority to make assistance payments under subsection (a) that is committed for use in a contract but is unused because the mortgage, loan, or advance of credit involved is refinanced (except to the extent provided in subsection (r) for mortgages insured under such subsection) or because such assistance payments are terminated or suspended for other reasons before the original termination date of such contract; and (iii) any amount received under subparagraph (C).</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(B) In the case of any homeowner whose assistance payments are terminated by reason of the 10-year limitation referred to in paragraph (1), <!-- PDFPage:657 -->and who is determined by the Secretary to be unable to assume the full payments due under the mortgage, loan, or advance of credit involved, the Secretary shall, to the extent of the availability of amounts in the fund established in subparagraph (A), contract to make, and make, continued assistance payments on behalf of such homeowner. Such continued assistance payments shall be made in an amount determined in accordance with the applicable provisions of paragraph (1) or subsection (a)(2)(B) and for such period as the Secretary determines to be appropriate.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(C) Any amounts in such fund determined by the Secretary to be in excess of the amounts currently required to carry out the provisions of subparagraph (B) shall be invested by the Secretary in obligations of, or obligations guaranteed as to both principal and interest by, the United States or any agency of the United States. Notwithstanding the preceding sentence, any amounts of budget authority or contract authority recaptured from assistance payments contracts relating to mortgages that are being refinanced that are not required for assistance payments contracts relating to mortgages insured under this subsection, shall be rescinded.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(d) Limitation on payments on behalf of family holding membership in cooperative association; occupancy; maximum amount of payment</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">Assistance payments to a mortgagee by the Secretary on behalf of a family holding membership in a cooperative association operating a housing project shall be made only during such time as the family is an occupant of such project and shall be in amounts computed on the basis of the formula set forth in subsection (c) applying the cooperative member's proportionate share of the obligations under the project mortgage to the items specified in the formula.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(e) Reimbursement for expenses in handling the mortgage</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">The Secretary may include in the payment to the mortgagee such amount, in addition to the amount computed under subsection (a)(2)(B), (c), (d), (j)(7), or (r), as he deems appropriate to reimburse the mortgagee for its expenses in handling the mortgage.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(f) Adoption of procedures for recertifications of mortgagor's or cooperative member's income</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">Procedures shall be adopted by the Secretary for recertifications of the mortgagor's (or cooperative member's) income at intervals of two years (or at shorter intervals where the Secretary deems it desirable) for the purpose of adjusting the amount of such assistance payments within the limits of the formula described in subsection (c).</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(g) Regulations to assure that sales price or other consideration paid is not increased above appraised value</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">The Secretary shall prescribe such regulations as he deems necessary to assure that the sales price of, or other consideration paid in connection with, the purchase by a homeowner of the property with respect to which assistance payments are to be made is not increased above the appraised value on which the maximum mortgage which the Secretary will insure is computed.</p>

The Secretary shall begin issuing new commitments and reservations to provide mortgage insurance and assistance payments under this section before the expiration of the 30-day period following the approval in any appropriation Act of budget authority for this section after November 30, 1983. Upon the expiration of one year following August 22, 1974, the Secretary shall not enter into new contracts for assistance payments under this section utilizing authority approved in appropriation Acts prior to July 1, 1974.

<p class="statutory-body">(2) Assistance payments under this section may be made only with respect to a family whose income at the time of initial occupancy does not exceed 95 per centum of the median income for the area, as determined by the Secretary with adjustments for smaller and larger families, except that the Secretary may establish income ceilings higher or lower than 95 per centum of the median for the area on the basis of his findings that such variations are necessary because of prevailing levels of construction costs, unusually high or low median family incomes, or other factors.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(3) Notwithstanding the provisions of subsections (b)(2) and (i)(3)(A) with respect to the prior construction or rehabilitation of a dwelling, or of the project in which there is a dwelling unit, for which assistance payments may be made, and notwithstanding the provisions of subsection (j)(1) authorizing the purchase of housing which is neither deteriorating nor substandard, not more than&mdash;</p>
