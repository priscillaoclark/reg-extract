<p class="statutory-body">To be eligible for insurance under this section a mortgage shall meet the following conditions:</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(1) The mortgaged property shall be held by a mortgagor approved by the Secretary. The Secretary may, in his discretion, require such mortgagor to be regulated or restricted as to rents or sales, charges, capital structure, rate of return, and methods of operation. The Secretary may make such contracts with, and acquire for not to exceed $100 stock or interest in any such mortgagor, as the Secretary may deem necessary to render effective such restriction or regulation. Such stock or interest shall be paid for out of the General Insurance Fund, and shall be redeemed by the mortgagor at par upon the termination of all obligations of the Secretary under the insurance.</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(2) The mortgage shall involve a principal obligation in an amount&mdash;</p>

<p class="statutory-body-1em">(3) The mortgagor shall enter into the agreement required by section 1715r of this title.</p>
<br class="Q04" />
<p class="statutory-body-block">The mortgage shall provide for complete amortization by periodic payments within such term as the Secretary shall prescribe, and shall bear interest (exclusive of premium charges for insurance) at not to exceed 4&#189; per centum per annum on the amount of the principal obligation outstanding at any time.
