<p class="statutory-body-1em">The term &quot;golden parachute payment&quot;&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(A) means a payment (or any agreement to make a payment) in the nature of compensation for the benefit of any institution-related party under an obligation of any Farm Credit System institution that&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-3em">(i) is contingent on the termination of the party's relationship with the institution; and</p>
<p class="statutory-body-3em">(ii) is received on or after the date on which&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-4em">(I) the institution is insolvent;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-4em">(II) a conservator or receiver is appointed for the institution;</p>

<br class="Q04" />
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(B) includes a payment that would be a golden parachute payment but for the fact that the payment was made before the date referred to in subparagraph (A)(ii) if the payment was made in contemplation of the occurrence of an event described in any subclause of subparagraph (A); but</p>

<p class="statutory-body-2em">(B) is removed or prohibited from participating in the conduct of the affairs of the institution.</p>

<p class="statutory-body-2em">(C) an independent contractor (including any attorney, appraiser, or accountant) that knowingly or recklessly participates in any violation of any law or regulation, any breach of fiduciary duty, or any unsafe or unsound practice that caused or is likely to cause more than a minimal financial loss to, or a significant adverse effect on, the Farm Credit System institution.</p>
<h4 class="paragraph-head">(4) Liability or legal expense</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">The term &quot;liability or legal expense&quot; means&mdash;</p>

<p class="statutory-body-2em">(B) any segregation of any funds or assets for the purpose of making, or under an agreement to make, any payment after the date on which the funds or assets are segregated, without regard to whether the obligation to make the payment is contingent on&mdash;</p>

<p class="statutory-body-2em">(B) the compensation represents a reasonable payment for services rendered.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(d) Certain payments prohibited</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">No Farm Credit System institution may prepay the salary or any liability or legal expense of any institution-related party if the payment is made&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(1) in contemplation of the insolvency of the institution or after the commission of an act of insolvency; and</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(2) with a view to, or with the result of&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(A) preventing the proper application of the assets of the institution to creditors; or</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(B) preferring 1 creditor over another creditor.</p>

<p class="statutory-body">Nothing in this section&mdash;</p>
