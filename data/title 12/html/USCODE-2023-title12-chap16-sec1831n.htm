<h4 class="subparagraph-head">(B) Stringency</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">If the appropriate Federal banking agency or the Corporation determines that the application of any generally accepted accounting principle to any insured depository institution is inconsistent with the objectives described in paragraph (1), the agency or the Corporation may, with respect to reports or statements required to be filed with such agency or Corporation, prescribe an accounting principle which is applicable to such institutions which is no less stringent than generally accepted accounting principles.</p>
<h4 class="paragraph-head">(3) Review and implementation of accounting principles required</h4>

<h4 class="subparagraph-head">(B) Modification of noncomplying measures</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">Modify or eliminate any accounting principle or reporting requirement of such Federal agency which the agency determines fails to comply with the objectives and standards established under paragraphs (1) and (2).</p>
<h4 class="subparagraph-head">(C) Inclusion of &quot;off balance sheet&quot; items</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">Develop and prescribe regulations which require that all assets and liabilities, including contingent assets and liabilities, of insured depository institutions be reported in, or otherwise taken into account in the preparation of any balance sheet, financial statement, report of condition, or other report of such institution, required to be filed with a Federal banking agency.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(b) Uniform accounting of capital standards</h4>
<h4 class="paragraph-head">(1) In general</h4>
