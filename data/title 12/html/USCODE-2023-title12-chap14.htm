<p class="note-body-1em">&quot;(1) The American credit union movement began as a cooperative effort to serve the productive and provident credit needs of individuals of modest means.</p>
<p class="note-body-1em">&quot;(2) Credit unions continue to fulfill this public purpose, and current members and membership groups should not face divestiture from the financial services institution of their choice as a result of recent court action.</p>
<p class="note-body-1em">&quot;(3) To promote thrift and credit extension, a meaningful affinity and bond among members, manifested by a commonality of routine interaction, shared and related work experiences, interests, or activities, or the maintenance of an otherwise well-understood sense of cohesion or identity is essential to the fulfillment of the public mission of credit unions.</p>
<p class="note-body-1em">&quot;(4) Credit unions, unlike many other participants in the financial services market, are exempt from Federal and most State taxes because they are member-owned, democratically operated, not-for-profit organizations generally managed by volunteer boards of directors and because they have the specified mission of meeting the credit and savings needs of consumers, especially persons of modest means.</p>
<p class="note-body-1em">&quot;(5) Improved credit union safety and soundness provisions will enhance the public benefit that citizens receive from these cooperative financial services institutions.&quot;</p>

<p class="note-body">By the authority vested in me as President by the Constitution and the laws of the United States of America, it is hereby ordered as follows:</p>
<p class="note-body"><cap-smallcap>Section</cap-smallcap> 1. <i>Revision</i>. (a) The National Credit Union Administration Board has caused to be made, and has recommended approval of, a new seal of office for the National Credit Union Administration (NCUA), the design of which accompanies and is hereby made a part of this order [not set out in the Code], and which is described as follows:</p>
<p class="note-body">(i) The eagle overlaid by the shield conveys the NCUA's role as an agency of the Federal Government. The text, &quot;NCUA,&quot; in white on a blue background on the crest of the shield is the core of the sign that federally insured credit unions are required to display.</p>
<p class="note-body">(ii) The three stars above the eagle represent the NCUA's three-member Board, appointed by the President of the United States by and with the advice and consent of the Senate.</p>
<p class="note-body">(iii) The oak branch the eagle is holding in its left talon symbolizes the NCUA's strength, honor, and longevity in carrying out its mission of promoting confidence in the national system of cooperative credit.</p>
<p class="note-body">(iv) The olive branch the eagle is holding in its right talon symbolizes the peace and prosperity facilitated by the economic growth and access to affordable financial services that the Nation's credit unions have long provided to millions of Americans.</p>
<p class="note-body">(v) The upper portion of the circle that forms the border of the seal sets forth the agency's title, &quot;National Credit Union Administration.&quot; The date &quot;1934&quot; in the lower portion of the circle reflects the creation of the Federal credit union system by the Congress in 1934 and the long unbroken line of Federal credit union regulation that evolved into the NCUA.</p>
<p class="note-body">(b) This seal is of suitable design and appropriate for adoption as the official seal of the NCUA.</p>
<p class="note-body">(c) I hereby approve this seal as the official seal of the NCUA.</p>

<!-- field-end:head -->
<!-- field-start:statute -->
<h4 class="subsection-head">(a) In general</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">Subject to subsection (b), Federal credit union membership shall consist of the incorporators and such other persons and incorporated and unincorporated organizations, to the extent permitted by rules and regulations prescribed by the Board, as may be elected to membership and as such shall each, subscribe to at least one share of its stock and pay the initial installment thereon and a uniform entrance fee if required by the board of directors. Shares may be issued in joint tenancy with right of survivorship with any persons designated by the credit union member, but no joint tenant shall be permitted to vote, obtain loans, or hold office, unless he is within the field of membership and is a qualified member.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(b) Membership field</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">Subject to the other provisions of this section, the membership of any Federal credit union shall be limited to the membership described in one of the following categories:</p>
<h4 class="paragraph-head">(1) Single common-bond credit union</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">One group that has a common bond of occupation or association.</p>
<h4 class="paragraph-head">(2) Multiple common-bond credit union</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">More than one group&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(A) each of which has (within the group) a common bond of occupation or association; and</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(B) the number of members, each of which (at the time the group is first included within the field of membership of a credit union described in this paragraph) does not exceed any numerical limitation applicable under subsection (d).</p>
<h4 class="paragraph-head">(3) Community credit union</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">Persons or organizations within a well-defined local community, neighborhood, or rural district.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(c) Exceptions</h4>
<h4 class="paragraph-head">(1) Grandfathered members and groups</h4>
<h4 class="subparagraph-head">(A) In general</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">Notwithstanding subsection (b)&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-3em">(i) any person or organization that is a member of any Federal credit union as of August 7, 1998, may remain a member of the credit union after August 7, 1998; and</p>
<p class="statutory-body-3em">(ii) a member of any group whose members constituted a portion of the membership of any Federal credit union as of August 7, 1998, shall continue to be eligible to become a member of that credit union, by virtue of membership in that group, after August 7, 1998.</p>
<h4 class="subparagraph-head">(B) Successors</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">If the common bond of any group referred to in subparagraph (A) is defined by any particular organization or business entity, subparagraph (A) shall continue to apply with respect to any successor to the organization or entity.</p>
<h4 class="paragraph-head">(2) Exception for underserved areas</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">Notwithstanding subsection (b), in the case of a Federal credit union, the field of membership category of which is described in subsection (b)(2), the Board may allow the membership of the credit union to include any person or organization within a local community, neighborhood, or rural district if&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(A) the Board determines that the local community, neighborhood, or rural district&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-3em">(i) is an &quot;investment area&quot;, as defined in section 4702(16) of this title, and meets such additional requirements as the Board may impose; and</p>
<p class="statutory-body-3em">(ii) is underserved, based on data of the Board and the Federal banking agencies (as defined in section 1813 of this title), by other depository institutions (as defined in section 461(b)(1)(A) of this title); and</p>
<br class="Q04" />
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(B) the credit union establishes and maintains an office or facility in the local community, neighborhood, or rural district at which credit union services are available.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(d) Multiple common-bond credit union group requirements</h4>
<h4 class="paragraph-head">(1) Numerical limitation</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">Except as provided in paragraph (2), only a group with fewer than 3,000 members shall be eligible to be included in the field of membership category of a credit union described in subsection (b)(2).</p>
<h4 class="paragraph-head">(2) Exceptions</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">In the case of any Federal credit union, the field of membership category of which is described in subsection (b)(2), the numerical limitation in paragraph (1) of this subsection shall not apply with respect to&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(A) any group that the Board determines, in writing and in accordance with the guide<!-- PDFPage:868 -->lines and regulations issued under paragraph (3), could not feasibly or reasonably establish a new single common-bond credit union, the field of membership category of which is described in subsection (b)(1) because&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-3em">(i) the group lacks sufficient volunteer and other resources to support the efficient and effective operation of a credit union;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-3em">(ii) the group does not meet the criteria that the Board has determined to be important for the likelihood of success in establishing and managing a new credit union, including demographic characteristics such as geographical location of members, diversity of ages and income levels, and other factors that may affect the financial viability and stability of a credit union; or</p>
<p class="statutory-body-3em">(iii) the group would be unlikely to operate a safe and sound credit union;</p>
<br class="Q04" />
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(B) any group transferred from another credit union&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-3em">(i) in connection with a merger or consolidation recommended by the Board or any appropriate State credit union supervisor based on safety and soundness concerns with respect to that other credit union; or</p>
<p class="statutory-body-3em">(ii) by the Board in the Board's capacity as conservator or liquidating agent with respect to that other credit union; or</p>
<br class="Q04" />
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(C) any group transferred in connection with a voluntary merger, having received conditional approval by the Administration of the merger application prior to October 25, 1996, but not having consummated the merger prior to October 25, 1996, if the merger is consummated not later than 180 days after August 7, 1998.</p>
<h4 class="paragraph-head">(3) Regulations and guidelines</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">The Board shall issue guidelines or regulations, after notice and opportunity for comment, setting forth the criteria that the Board will apply in determining under this subsection whether or not an additional group may be included within the field of membership category of an existing credit union described in subsection (b)(2).</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(e) Additional membership eligibility provisions</h4>
<h4 class="paragraph-head">(1) Membership eligibility limited to immediate family or household members</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">No individual shall be eligible for membership in a credit union on the basis of the relationship of the individual to another person who is eligible for membership in the credit union, unless the individual is a member of the immediate family or household (as those terms are defined by the Board, by regulation) of the other person.</p>
<h4 class="paragraph-head">(2) Retention of membership</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">Except as provided in section 1764 of this title, once a person becomes a member of a credit union in accordance with this subchapter, that person or organization may remain a member of that credit union until the person or organization chooses to withdraw from the membership of the credit union.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(f) Criteria for approval of expansion of multiple common-bond credit unions</h4>
<h4 class="paragraph-head">(1) In general</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">The Board shall&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(A) encourage the formation of separately chartered credit unions instead of approving an application to include an additional group within the field of membership of an existing credit union whenever practicable and consistent with reasonable standards for the safe and sound operation of the credit union; and</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(B) if the formation of a separate credit union by the group is not practicable or consistent with the standards referred to in subparagraph (A), require the inclusion of the group in the field of membership of a credit union that is within reasonable proximity to the location of the group whenever practicable and consistent with reasonable standards for the safe and sound operation of the credit union.</p>
<h4 class="paragraph-head">(2) Approval criteria</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">The Board may not approve any application by a Federal credit union, the field of membership category of which is described in subsection (b)(2) to include any additional group within the field of membership of the credit union (or an application by a Federal credit union described in subsection (b)(1) to include an additional group and become a credit union described in subsection (b)(2)), unless the Board determines, in writing, that&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(A) the credit union has not engaged in any unsafe or unsound practice (as defined in section 1786(b) of this title) that is material during the 1-year period preceding the date of filing of the application;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(B) the credit union is adequately capitalized;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(C) the credit union has the administrative capability to serve the proposed membership group and the financial resources to meet the need for additional staff and assets to serve the new membership group;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(D) any potential harm that the expansion of the field of membership of the credit union may have on any other insured credit union and its members is clearly outweighed in the public interest by the probable beneficial effect of the expansion in meeting the convenience and needs of the members of the group proposed to be included in the field of membership; and</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(E) the credit union has met such additional requirements as the Board may prescribe, by regulation.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(g) Regulations required for community credit unions</h4>
<h4 class="paragraph-head">(1) Definition of well-defined local community, neighborhood, or rural district</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">The Board shall prescribe, by regulation, a definition for the term &quot;well-defined local community, neighborhood, or rural district&quot; for purposes of&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(A) making any determination with regard to the field of membership of a credit union described in subsection (b)(3); and</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(B) establishing the criteria applicable with respect to any such determination.</p>
<!-- PDFPage:869 --><h4 class="paragraph-head">(2) Scope of application</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">The definition prescribed by the Board under paragraph (1) shall apply with respect to any application to form a new credit union, or to alter or expand the field of membership of an existing credit union, that is filed with the Board after August 7, 1998.</p>

<h4 class="subsection-head">(a) Members; meetings; lines of credit and approval of loans; delegation to loan officers</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">If the bylaws provide for a credit committee, then pursuant to the provisions of the bylaws, the board of directors may appoint or the members may elect a credit committee which shall consist of an odd number of members of the credit union, but which shall not include more than one loan officer. The method used shall be set forth in the bylaws. The credit committee shall hold such meetings as the business of the Federal credit union may require, not less frequently than once a month, to consider applications for loans or lines of credit. Reasonable notice of such meetings shall be given to all members of the committee. Except for those loans or lines of credit required to be approved by the board of directors in section 1757(5) of this title, approval of an application shall be by majority of the committee who are present at the meeting at which it is considered provided that a majority of the full committee is present. The credit committee may appoint and delegate to loan officers the authority to approve applications.</p>

<p class="statutory-body">If the bylaws provide for a credit committee, all applications not approved by the loan officer shall be reviewed by the credit committee, and the approval of a majority of the members who are present at the meeting when such review is undertaken shall be required to reverse the loan officer's decision provided a majority of the full committee is present. If there is not a credit committee, a member shall have the right upon written request of review by the board of directors of a loan application which has been denied. No individual shall have authority to disburse funds of the Federal credit union with respect to any loan or line of credit for which the application has been approved by him in his capacity as a loan officer.</p>

If such a policy is adopted, written notice of the policy as adopted and the effective date of such policy shall be mailed to each member of the credit union at the member's current address appearing on the records of the credit union not less than thirty days prior to the effective date of such policy.

<h3 class="section-head">&sect;1766. Powers of Board</h3>
<!-- field-end:head -->
<!-- field-start:statute -->
<p class="statutory-body">(a) The Board may prescribe rules and regulations for the administration of this chapter (including, but not by way of limitation, the merger, consolidation, and dissolution of corporations organized under this chapter). Any central credit union chartered by the Board shall be subject to such rules, regulations, and orders as the Board deems appropriate and, except as otherwise specifically provided in such rules, regulations, or orders, shall be vested with or subject to the same rights, privileges, duties, restrictions, penalties, liabilities, conditions, and limitations that would apply to all Federal credit unions under this chapter.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(b)(1) The Board may suspend or revoke the charter of any Federal credit union, or place the same in involuntary liquidation and appoint a liquidating agent therefor, upon its finding that the organization is bankrupt or insolvent, or has violated any of the provisions of its charter, its bylaws, this chapter, or any regulations issued thereunder.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(2) The Board, through such persons as it shall designate, may examine any Federal credit union in voluntary liquidation and, upon its finding that such voluntary liquidation is not being conducted in an orderly or efficient manner or in the best interests of its members, may terminate such voluntary liquidation and place such organization in involuntary liquidation and appoint a liquidating agent therefor.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(3) Such liquidating agent shall have power and authority, subject to the control and supervision of the Board and under such rules and regulations as the Board may prescribe, (A) to receive and take possession of the books, records, assets, and property of every description of the Federal credit union in liquidation, to sell, enforce collection of, and liquidate all such assets and property, to compound all bad or doubtful debts, and to sue in his own name or in the name of the Federal credit union in liquidation, and defend such actions as may be brought against him as liquidating agent or against the Federal credit union; (B) to receive, examine, and pass upon all claims against the Federal credit union in liquidation, including claims of members on member accounts; (C) to make distribution and payment to creditors and members as their interests may appear; and (D) to execute such documents and papers and to do such other acts and things which he may deem necessary or desirable to discharge his duties hereunder.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(4) Subject to the control and supervision of the Board and under such rules and regulations as the Board may prescribe, the liquidating agent of a Federal credit union in involuntary liquidation shall (A) cause notice to be given to creditors and members to present their claims and make legal proof thereof, which notice shall be published once a week in each of three successive weeks in a newspaper of general circulation in each county in which the Federal credit union in liquidation maintained an office or branch for the transaction of business on the date it ceased unrestricted operations; except that whenever the aggregate book value of the assets and property of a Federal credit union in involuntary liquidation is less than $1,000, unless the Board shall find that its books and records do not contain a true and accurate record of its liabilities he shall declare such Federal credit union in liquidation to be a &quot;no publication&quot; liquidation, and publication of notice to creditors and members shall not be required in such case; (B) from time to time make a ratable dividend on all such claims as may have been proved to his satisfaction or adjudicated in a court of competent jurisdiction and, after the assets of such organization have been liquidated, make further dividends on all claims previously proved or adjudicated, and he may accept in lieu of a formal proof of claim on behalf of any creditor or member the statement of <!-- PDFPage:877 -->any amount due to such creditor or member as shown on the books and records of the credit union; but all claims not filed before payment of the final dividend shall be barred and claims rejected or disallowed by the liquidating agent shall be likewise barred unless suit be instituted thereon within three months after notice of rejection or disallowance; and (C) in a &quot;no publication&quot; liquidation, determine from all sources available to him, and within the limits of available funds of the Federal credit union, the amounts due to creditors and members, and after sixty days shall have elapsed from the date of his appointment distribute the funds of the Federal credit union to creditors and members ratably and as their interests may appear.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(5) Upon certification by the liquidating agent in the case of an involuntary liquidation, and upon such proof as shall be satisfactory to the Board in the case of a voluntary liquidation, that distribution has been made and that liquidation has been completed, as provided herein, the Board shall cancel the charter of such Federal credit union; but the corporate existence of the Federal credit union shall continue for a period of three years from the date of such cancellation of its charter, during which period the liquidating agent, or his duly appointed successor, or such persons as the Board shall designate, may act on behalf of the Federal credit union for the purpose of paying, satisfying, and discharging any existing liabilities or obligations, collecting and distributing its assets, and doing all other acts required to adjust and wind up its business and affairs, and it may sue and be sued in its corporate name.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(c) After the expiration of five years from the date of cancellation of the charter of a Federal credit union the Board may, in its discretion, destroy any or all books and records of such Federal credit union in its possession or under its control.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(d) The Board is authorized and empowered to execute any and all functions and perform any and all duties vested in it hereby, through such persons as it shall designate or employ; and it may delegate to any person or persons, including any institution operating under the general supervision of the Administration, the performance and discharge of any authority, power, or function vested in it by this chapter.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(e) All books and records of Federal credit unions shall be kept and reports shall be made in accordance with forms approved by the Board.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(f)(1) The Board is authorized to make investigations and to conduct researches and studies of the problems of persons of small means in obtaining credit at reasonable rates of interest, and of the methods and benefits of cooperative saving and lending among such persons. It is further authorized to make reports of such investigations and to publish and disseminate the same.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(2)(A) The Board is authorized to conduct directly, or to make grants to or contracts with colleges or universities, State or local educational agencies, or other appropriate public or private nonprofit organizations to conduct, programs for the training of persons engaged, or preparing to engage, in the operation of credit unions, and in related consumer counseling programs, serving the poor. It is authorized to establish a program of experimental, developmental, demonstration, and pilot projects, either directly or by grants to public or private nonprofit organizations, including credit unions, or by contracts with such organizations or other private organizations, designed to promote more effective operation of credit unions, and related consumer counseling programs, serving the poor.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(B) In carrying out its authority under this paragraph, the Board shall consult with officials of the Office of Economic Opportunity and other appropriate Federal agencies responsible for the administration of projects or programs concerned with problems of the poor. The development and operation of programs and projects under this paragraph shall involve maximum feasible participation of residents of the areas and members of the groups served by such programs and projects, with community action agencies established under the provisions of the Economic Opportunity Act of 1964 [42 U.S.C. 2701 et seq.] serving, to the extent feasible, as the means through which such participation is achieved.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(C) In order to carry out the purposes of this paragraph, there is authorized to be appropriated, as a supplement to any funds that may be expended by the Board pursuant to sections 1755 and 1756 of this title for such purposes, not to exceed $300,000 for the fiscal year ending June 30, 1970, and not to exceed $1,000,000 for the fiscal year ending June 30, 1971.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(g) Any officer or employee of the Administration is authorized, when designated for the purpose by the Board, to administer oaths and affirmations and to take affidavits and depositions touching upon any matter within the jurisdiction of the Administration.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(h) The Board is authorized, empowered, and directed to require that every person appointed or elected by any Federal credit union to any position requiring the receipt, payment, or custody of money or other personal property owned by a Federal credit union, or in its custody or control as collateral or otherwise, give bond in a corporate surety company holding a certificate of authority from the Secretary of the Treasury under chapter 93 of title 31, as an acceptable surety on Federal bonds. Any such bond or bonds shall be in a form approved by the Board with a view to providing surety coverage to the Federal credit union with reference to loss by reason of acts of fraud or dishonesty including forgery, theft, embezzlement, wrongful abstraction, or misapplication on the part of the person, directly or through connivance with others, and such other surety coverages as the Board may determine to be reasonably appropriate or as elsewhere required by this chapter. Any such bond or bonds shall be in such an amount in relation to the money or other personal property involved or in relation to the assets of the Federal credit union as the Board may from time to time prescribe by regulation for the purpose of requiring reasonable coverage. In lieu of individual bonds the Board may approve the use of a form of schedule or blanket bond which covers all of the officers and employ<!-- PDFPage:878 -->ees of a Federal credit union whose duties include the receipt, payment, or custody of money or other personal property for or on behalf of the Federal credit union. The Board may also approve the use of a form of excess coverage bond whereby a Federal credit union may obtain an amount of coverage in excess of the basic surety coverage.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(i) In addition to the authority conferred upon it by other sections of this chapter, the Board is authorized in carrying out its functions under this chapter&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(1) to appoint such personnel as may be necessary to enable the Administration to carry out its functions;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(2) to expend such funds, enter into such contracts with public and private organizations and persons, make such payments in advance or by way of reimbursement, acquire and dispose of, by lease or purchase, real or personal property, without regard to the provisions of any other law applicable to executive or independent agencies of the United States, and perform such other functions or acts as it may deem necessary or appropriate to carry out the provisions of this chapter, in accordance with the rules and regulations or policies established by the Board not inconsistent with this chapter; and</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(3) to pay stipends, including allowances for travel to and from the place of residence, to any individual to study in a program assisted under this chapter upon a determination by the Board that assistance to such individual in such studies will be in furtherance of the purposes of this chapter.</p>
<br class="Q04" />
<p class="statutory-body">(j) <cap-smallcap>Staff.&mdash;</cap-smallcap></p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(1) <cap-smallcap>Appointment and compensation</cap-smallcap>.&mdash;The Board shall fix the compensation and number of, and appoint and direct, employees of the Board. Rates of basic pay for employees of the Board may be set and adjusted by the Board without regard to the provisions of chapter 51 or subchapter III of chapter 53 of title 5.</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(2) <cap-smallcap>Additional compensation and benefits</cap-smallcap>.&mdash;The Board may provide additional compensation and benefits to employees of the Board if the same type of compensation or benefits are then being provided by any other Federal bank regulatory agency or, if not then being provided, could be provided by such an agency under applicable provisions of law, rule, or regulation. In setting and adjusting the total amount of compensation and benefits for employees of the Board, the Board shall seek to maintain comparability with other Federal bank regulatory agencies.</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(3) <cap-smallcap>Funding</cap-smallcap>.&mdash;The salaries and expenses of the Board and employees of the Board shall be paid from fees and assessments (including income earned on insurance deposits) levied on insured credit unions under this chapter.</p>

<p class="statutory-body-1em">(1) The proposition for such conversion shall first be approved, and a date set for a vote <!-- PDFPage:881 -->thereon by the members (either at a meeting to be held on such date or by written ballot to be filed on or before such date), by a majority of the directors of the Federal credit union. Written notice of the proposition and of the date set for the vote shall then be delivered in person to each member, or mailed to each member at the address for such member appearing on the records of the credit union, not more than thirty nor less than seven days prior to such date. Approval of the proposition for conversion shall be by the affirmative vote of a majority of the members of the credit union who vote on the proposal. The written notice of the proposition shall in boldface type state that the issue will be decided by a majority of the members who vote.</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(2) A statement of the results of the vote, verified by the affidavits of the president or vice president and the secretary, shall be filed with the Administration within ten days after the vote is taken.</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(3) Promptly after the vote is taken and in no event later than ninety days thereafter, if the proposition for conversion was approved by such vote, the credit union shall take such action as may be necessary under the applicable State law to make it a State credit union, and within ten days after receipt of the State credit union charter there shall be filed with the Administration a copy of the charter thus issued. Upon such filing the credit union shall cease to be a Federal credit union.</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(4) Upon ceasing to be a Federal credit union, such credit union shall no longer be subject to any of the provisions of this chapter. The successor State credit union shall be vested with all of the assets and shall continue responsible for all of the obligations of the Federal credit union to the same extent as though the conversion had not taken place.</p>

<p class="statutory-body">(b)(1) A State credit union, organized under the laws of any State, the District of Columbia, the several Territories and possessions of the United States, the Panama Canal Zone, or the Commonwealth of Puerto Rico, may be converted into a Federal credit union by (A) complying with all State requirements requisite to enabling it to convert to a Federal credit union or to cease being a State credit union, (B) filing with the Administration proof of such compliance, satisfactory to the Board, and (C) filing with the Administration an organization certificate as required by this chapter.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(2) When the Board has been satisfied that all of such requirements, and all other requirements of this chapter, have been complied with, the Board shall approve the organization certificate. Upon such approval, the State credit union shall become a Federal credit union as of the date it ceases to be a State credit union. The Federal credit union shall be vested with all of the assets and shall continue responsible for all of the obligations of the State credit union to the same extent as though the conversion had not taken place.</p>

<h4 class="subsection-head">(b) Factors to be considered</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">In determining whether a franchise shall be forfeited under subsection (a), the Board shall take into account the following factors:</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(1) The extent to which directors, committee members, or senior executive officers (as defined by the Board in regulations which the Board shall prescribe) of the credit union knew of, or were involved in, the commission of the money laundering offense of which the credit union was found guilty.</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(2) The extent to which the offense occurred despite the existence of policies and procedures within the credit union which were designed to prevent the occurrence of any such offense.</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(3) The extent to which the credit union has fully cooperated with law enforcement authorities with respect to the investigation of the money laundering offense of which the credit union was found guilty.</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(4) The extent to which the credit union has implemented additional internal controls (since the commission of the offense of which the credit union was found guilty) to prevent the occurrence of any other money laundering offense.</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(5) The extent to which the interest of the local community in having adequate deposit and credit services available would be threatened by the forfeiture of the franchise.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(c) Successor liability</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">This section shall not apply to a successor to the interests of, or a person who acquires, a credit union that violated a provision of law described in subsection (a), if the successor succeeds to the interests of the violator, or the acquisition is made, in good faith and not for purposes of evading this section or regulations prescribed under this section.</p>

<br class="Q04" />
<p class="statutory-body">(2) The Board shall disapprove the application of any credit union for insurance of its member accounts if it finds that its reserves are inadequate, that its financial condition and policies are unsafe or unsound, that its management is unfit, that insurance of its member accounts would otherwise involve undue risk to the fund, or that its powers and purposes are inconsistent with the promotion of thrift among its members and the creation of a source of credit for provident or productive purposes.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(3) Repealed. Pub. L. 95&ndash;22, title III, &sect;301, Apr. 19, 1977, 91 Stat. 49.</p>

<p class="statutory-body">(1) Each insured credit union shall make reports of condition to the Board upon dates which shall be selected by it. Such reports of condition shall be in such form and shall contain such information as the Board may require. The reporting dates selected for reports of condition shall be the same for all insured credit unions except that when any of said reporting dates is a nonbusiness day for any credit union the preceding business day shall be its reporting date. The total amount of the member accounts of each insured credit union as of each reporting date shall be reported in such reports of condition in accordance with regulations prescribed by the Board. Each report of condition shall contain a declaration by the president, by a vice president, by the treasurer, or by any other officer designated by the board of directors of the reporting credit union to make such declaration, that the report is true and correct to the best of such officer's knowledge and belief. Unless such requirement is waived by the Board, the correctness of each report of condition shall be attested by the signatures of three of the officers of the reporting credit union with the declaration that the report has been examined by them and to the best of their knowledge and belief is true and correct.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(2) The Board may call for such other reports as it may from time to time require.</p>
<!-- PDFPage:887 --><p class="statutory-body">(3) The Board may require reports of condition to be published in such manner, not inconsistent with any applicable law, as it may direct. Any insured credit union which maintains procedures reasonably adapted to avoid any inadvertent error and, unintentionally and as a result of such an error, fails to submit or publish any report required under this subsection or section 1756 of this title, within the period of time specified by the Board, or submits or publishes any false or misleading report or information, or inadvertently transmits or publishes any report which is minimally late, shall be subject to a penalty of not more than $2,000 for each day during which such failure continues or such false or misleading information is not corrected. The insured credit union shall have the burden of proving that an error was inadvertent and that a report was inadvertently transmitted or published late. Any insured credit union which fails to submit or publish any report required under this subsection or section 1756 of this title, within the period of time specified by the Board, or submits or publishes any false or misleading report or information, in a manner not described in the 2nd preceding sentence shall be subject to a penalty of not more than $20,000 for each day during which such failure continues or such false or misleading information is not corrected. Notwithstanding the preceding sentence, if any insured credit union knowingly or with reckless disregard for the accuracy of any information or report described in such sentence submits or publishes any false or misleading report or information, the Board may assess a penalty of not more than $1,000,000 or 1 percent of total assets of such credit union, whichever is less, per day for each day during which such failure continues or such false or misleading information is not corrected. Any penalty imposed under any of the 4 preceding sentences shall be assessed and collected by the Board in the manner provided in section 1786(k)(2) of this title (for penalties imposed under such section) and any such assessment (including the determination of the amount of the penalty) shall be subject to the provisions of such section. Any insured credit union against which any penalty is assessed under this subsection shall be afforded an agency hearing if such insured credit union submits a request for such hearing within 20 days after the issuance of the notice of assessment. Section 1786(j) of this title shall apply to any proceeding under this subsection.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(4) The Board may accept any report of condition made to any commission, board, or authority having supervision of a State-chartered credit union and may furnish to any such commission, board, or authority reports of condition made to the Board.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(5) Reports required under subchapter I of this chapter shall be so prepared that they can be used for share insurance purposes.

The provisions of this paragraph shall not be applicable in any case in which the default is due to a dispute between the credit union and the Board over the amount of its deposit or the premium charge due to the fund if the credit union deposits security satisfactory to the Board for payment of its deposit or the premium charge upon final determination of the issue.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(e) Recovery of unpaid deposit or premium; limitations</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">The Board, in a suit brought at law or in equity in any court of competent jurisdiction, shall be entitled to recover from any insured credit union the amount of any unpaid deposit or premium charge for insurance lawfully payable by the credit union to the fund, whether or not such credit union shall have made any report of condition under subsection (a) of this section or filed any certified statement required under subsection (b) of this section and whether or not suit shall have been brought to compel the credit union to make any such report or to file any such statement. No action or proceeding shall be brought for the recovery of any deposit or premium charge due to the fund, or for the recovery of any amount paid to the fund in excess of the amount due it, unless such action or proceeding shall have been brought within five years after the right accrued for which the claim is made. Where the insured credit union has made or filed with the Board a false or fraudulent certified statement with the intent to evade, in whole or in part, the payment of its deposit or any premium charge, the claim shall not be deemed to have accrued until the discovery by the Board of the fact that the certified statement is false or fraudulent.</p>

<p class="statutory-body">Should any Federal credit union fail to make any report of condition under subsection (a) of this section or to file any certified statement required to be filed under subsection (b) of this section or to pay its deposit or any premium charge for insurance required to be paid under any provision of this subchapter, and should the credit union fail to correct such failure within thirty days after written notice has been given by the Board to an officer of the credit union, citing this subsection and stating that the credit union has failed to make any such report or file any such statement or pay any such deposit or premium charges as required by law, all the rights, privileges, and franchises of the credit union granted to it under subchapter I of this chapter shall be thereby forfeited. Whether or not the penalty provided in this subsection has been incurred shall be determined and adjudged by any court of the United States of competent jurisdiction in a suit brought for that purpose in the district or territory in which the principal office of such credit union is located, under direction of and by the Board in its own name, before the credit union shall be declared dissolved. The remedies provided in this subsection and in subsections (d) and (e) of this section shall not be construed as limiting any other remedies against any insured credit union but shall be in addition thereto.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(g) Records</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">Each insured credit union shall maintain such records as will readily permit verification of the correctness of its reports of condition, certified statements, and deposit and premium charges for insurance. However, no insured credit union shall be required to retain such records for such purpose for a period in excess of five years from the date of the making of any such report, the filing of any such statement, or the payment of any deposit or adjustment thereof or any premium charge, except that when there is a dispute between the insured credit union and the Board over the amount of any deposit or adjustment thereof or any premium charge for insur<!-- PDFPage:891 -->ance the credit union shall retain such records until final determination of the issue.</p>

Money in the fund shall be available upon requisition by the Board, without fiscal year limitation, for making payments of insurance under section 1787 of this title, for providing assistance and making expenditures under section 1788 of this title in connection with the liquidation or threatened liquidation of insured credit unions, and for such administrative and other expenses incurred in carrying out the purposes of this subchapter as it may determine to be proper.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(b) Deposit of deposits and premium charges, fees and penalties</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">All deposits and premium charges for insurance paid pursuant to the provisions of section 1782 of this title and all fees for examinations and all penalties collected by the Board under any provision of this subchapter shall be deposited in the National Credit Union Share Insurance Fund.

Such report shall also include the results of an independent audit of the fund.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(c) Investment authorization</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">The Board may authorize the Secretary of the Treasury to invest and reinvest such portions of the fund as the Board may determine are not needed for current operations in any interest-bearing securities of the United States or in any securities guaranteed as to both principal and interest by the United States or in bonds or other obligations which are lawful investments for fiduciary, trust, and public funds of the United States, and the income therefrom shall constitute a part of the fund.</p>

The Secretary of the Treasury shall determine the applicable interest rate in advance by calculating the average yield to maturity (on the basis of daily closing market bid quotations during the month of September of the preceding fiscal year) on outstanding marketable public debt obligations of the United States having a maturity date of five or less years from the first day of such month of September and by adjusting such yield to the nearest one-eighth of 1 per centum.</p>

<h4 class="subsection-head">(e) Excess funds credited against loans</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">So long as any loans to the fund are outstanding, the Board shall from time to time, not less often than annually, determine whether the balance in the fund is in excess of the amount which, in its judgment, is needed to meet the requirements of the fund and shall pay such excess to the Secretary of the Treasury, to be credited against the loans to the fund.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(f) Authorization for fund to borrow from Central Liquidity Facility</h4>

<h4 class="subsection-head">(a) Examiners and claim agents; powers; report by examiner; jurisdiction of court</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">The Board shall appoint examiners who shall have power, on its behalf, to examine any insured credit union, any credit union making application for insurance of its member accounts, or any closed insured credit union whenever in the judgment of the Board an examination is necessary to determine the condition of any such credit union for insurance purposes. Each examiner shall have power to make a thorough examination of all of the affairs of the credit union and shall make a full and detailed report of the condition of the credit union to the Board. The Board in like manner shall appoint claim agents who shall have power to investigate and examine all claims for insured member accounts. Each claim agent shall have power to administer oaths and affirmations, to examine and to take and preserve testimony under oath as to any matter in respect to claims for insured accounts, and to issue subpenas and subpenas duces tecum and, for the enforcement thereof, to apply to the United States district court for the judicial district or the United States court in any territory in which the principal office of the credit union is located or in which the witness resides or carries on business. Such courts shall have jurisdiction and power to order and require compliance with any such subpena.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(b) Power of Board; jurisdiction of court</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">In connection with examinations of insured credit unions, or with other types of investigations to determine compliance with applicable law and regulations, the Board, or its designated representatives, shall have power to administer oaths and affirmations, to examine and to take and preserve testimony under oath as to any matter in respect of the affairs of any such credit union, and to issue subpenas and subpenas <!-- PDFPage:895 -->duces tecum and to exercise such other powers as are set forth in section 1786(p) of this title and, for the enforcement thereof, to apply to the United States district court for the judicial district or the United States Court in any territory in which the principal office of the credit union is located or in which the witness resides or carries on business. Such courts shall have jurisdiction and power to order and require compliance with any such subpena.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(c) Court orders enforcing subpenas; immunity</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">In cases of refusal to obey a subpena issued to, or contumacy by, any person, the Board may invoke the aid of any court of the United States within the jurisdiction of which such hearing, examination, or investigation is carried on, or where such person resides or carries on business, in requiring the attendance and testimony of witnesses and the production of books, records, or other papers. Such court may issue an order requiring such person to appear before the Board, or before a person designated by it, there to produce records, if so ordered, or to give testimony touching the matter in question. Any failure to obey such order of the court may be punished by such court as a contempt thereof. All process in any such case may be served in the judicial district whereof such person is an inhabitant or carries on business or wherever he may be found. No person shall be excused from attending and testifying or from producing books, records, or other papers in obedience to a subpena issued under the authority of this subchapter on the ground that the testimony or evidence, documentary or otherwise, required of him may tend to incriminate him or subject him to penalty or forfeiture, but no individual shall be prosecuted or subject to any penalty or forfeiture for or on account of any transaction, matter, or thing concerning which he is compelled to testify or produce evidence, documentary or otherwise, after having claimed his privilege against self-incrimination, except that such individual so testifying shall not be exempt from prosecution and punishment for perjury committed in so testifying.</p>

If such greater rate of interest has been <!-- PDFPage:900 -->paid, the person who paid it may recover, in a civil action commenced in a court of appropriate jurisdiction not later than two years after the date of such payment, an amount equal to twice the amount of interest paid from the credit union taking or receiving such interest.</p>

Unless such correction shall be made within one hundred and twenty days after service of such statement, or within such shorter period of not less than twenty days after such service as the Board shall require in any case where it determines that the insurance risk with respect to such credit union could be unduly jeopardized by further delay in the correction of such practices or conditions or violations, or as the commission, board, or authority having supervision of such credit union, if any, shall require in the case of an insured State-chartered credit union, the Board, if it shall determine to proceed further, shall give to the credit union not less than thirty days&apos; written notice of its intention to terminate the status of the credit union as an insured credit union. Such notice shall contain a statement of the facts constituting the alleged unsafe and unsound practices or conditions or violations and shall fix a time and place for a hearing thereon. Such hearing shall be fixed for a date not earlier than thirty days nor later than sixty days after service of such notice unless an earlier or a later date is set by the Board at the request of the credit union. Unless the credit union shall appear at the hearing by a duly authorized representative, it shall be deemed to have consented to the termination of its status as an insured credit union. In the event of such consent, or if upon the record made at any such hearing the Board shall find that any unsafe or unsound practice or condition or violation specified in the notice has been established and has not been corrected within the time above-prescribed in which to make such correction, the Board may issue and serve upon the credit union an order terminating its status as an insured credit union on a date subsequent to the date of such finding and subsequent to the expiration of the time specified in the notice.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(2) Any credit union whose insured status has been terminated by order of the Board under this subsection shall have the right of judicial review of such order only to the same extent as provided for the review of orders under subsection (j) of this section.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(c) Notice to members of termination of insured status</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">In the event of the termination of a credit union's status as an insured credit union as provided under subsection (a)(1) or (b) of this section, the credit union shall give prompt and reasonable notice to all of its members whose accounts are insured that it has ceased to be an insured credit union. It may include in such notice a statement of the fact that member accounts insured on the effective date of such termination, to the extent not withdrawn, remain insured for one year from the date of such termination, but it shall not further represent itself in any manner as an insured credit union. In the event of failure to give the notice as herein provided to members whose accounts are insured, the Board is authorized to give reasonable notice.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(d) Continuation of insurance for one year; approval of conversion of status; procedure subsequent to approval; reduction of premium charges</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">(1) After the termination of the insured status of any credit union as provided under subsection (a)(1) or (b) of this section, insurance of its member accounts to the extent that they were insured on the effective date of such termination, less any amounts thereafter withdrawn which reduce the accounts below the amount covered by insurance on the effective date of such termination, shall continue for a period of one year, but no shares issued by the credit union or deposits made after the date of such termination shall be insured by the Board. The credit union shall continue to maintain its deposit with and pay premiums to the Board during such period as in the case of an insured credit union and the Board shall have the right to examine such credit union from time to time during the period during which such insurance continues. Such credit union shall, in all other respects, be subject to the duties and obligations of an insured credit union for the period of one year from the date of such termination. In the event that such credit union shall be closed for liquidation within such period of one year, the Board shall have the same powers and rights with respect to such credit union as in the case of an insured credit union. Notwithstanding the above, when an insured credit union's insured status is terminated and the credit union subsequently obtains comparable insurance coverage from another source, insurance of its accounts by the fund may cease immediately upon the ef<!-- PDFPage:903 -->fective date of such comparable coverage by mutual consent of the credit union and the Board.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(2) No credit union shall convert from status as an insured credit union under this chapter as provided under subsection (a)(2) of this section until the proposition for such conversion has been approved by a majority of all the directors of the credit union, and by affirmative vote of a majority of the members of the credit union who vote on the proposition in a vote in which at least 20 per centum of the total membership of the credit union participates. Following approval by the directors, written notice of the proposition and of the date set for the membership vote shall be delivered in person to each member, or mailed to each member at the address for such member appearing on the records of the credit union, not more than thirty nor less than seven days prior to such date. The membership shall be given the opportunity to vote by mail ballot. If the proposition is approved by the membership, prompt and reasonable notice of insurance conversion shall be given to all members.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(3) In the event of a conversion of a credit union from status as an insured credit union under this chapter as provided under subsection (a)(2) of this section, premium charges payable under section 1782(c) of this title shall be reduced by an amount proportionate to the number of calendar months for which the converting credit union will no longer be insured under this chapter. As long as a converting credit union remains insured under this chapter, it shall remain subject to all of the provisions of this subchapter.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(e) Opinion of Board as to unsound condition of credit union; notice of charges; hearing; order to cease and desist; judicial review</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">(1) If, in the opinion of the Board, any insured credit union, credit union which has insured accounts, or any institution-affiliated party is engaging or has engaged, or the Board has reasonable cause to believe that the credit union or any institution-affiliated party is about to engage, in an unsafe or unsound practice in conducting the business of such credit union, or is violating or has violated, or the Board has reasonable cause to believe that the credit union or any institution-affiliated party is about to violate, a law, rule, or regulation, or any condition imposed in writing by the Board in connection with the granting of any application or other request by the credit union or any written agreement entered into with the Board, the Board may issue and serve upon the credit union or such party a notice of charges in respect thereof. The notice shall contain a statement of the facts constituting the alleged violation or violations or the unsafe or unsound practice or practices, and shall fix a time and place at which a hearing will be held to determine whether an order to cease and desist therefrom should issue against the credit union or the institution-affiliated party. Such hearing shall be fixed for a date not earlier than thirty days nor later than sixty days after service of such notice unless an earlier or a later date is set by the Board at the request of any party so served. Unless the party or parties so served shall appear at the hearing by a duly authorized representative, they shall be deemed to have consented to the issuance of the cease-and-desist order. In the event of such consent, or if upon the record made at any such hearing, the Board shall find that any violation or unsafe or unsound practice specified in the notice of charges has been established, the Board may issue and serve upon the credit union or the institution-affiliated party an order to cease and desist from any such violation or practice. Such order may, by provisions which may be mandatory or otherwise, require the credit union or its institution-affiliated parties to cease and desist from the same, and, further, to take affirmative action to correct the conditions resulting from any such violation or practice.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(2) A cease-and-desist order shall become effective at the expiration of thirty days after the service of such order upon the credit union or other person concerned (except in the case of a cease-and-desist order issued upon consent, which shall become effective at the time specified therein), and shall remain effective and enforceable as provided therein, except to such extent as it is stayed, modified, terminated, or set aside by action of the Board or a reviewing court.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(3) <cap-smallcap>Affirmative action to correct conditions resulting from violations or practices</cap-smallcap>.&mdash;The authority to issue an order under this subsection and subsection (f) which requires an insured credit union or any institution-affiliated party to take affirmative action to correct any conditions resulting from any violation or practice with respect to which such order is issued includes the authority to require such insured credit union or such party to&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(A) make restitution or provide reimbursement, indemnification, or guarantee against loss if&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(i) such credit union or such party was unjustly enriched in connection with such violation or practice; or</p>

<p class="statutory-body">(4) <cap-smallcap>Authority to limit activities</cap-smallcap>.&mdash;The authority to issue an order under this subsection or subsection (f) includes the authority to place limitations on the activities or functions of an insured credit union or any institution-affiliated party.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(f) Temporary cease and desist order; injunctive procedure</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">(1) Whenever the Board shall determine that the violation or threatened violation or the unsafe or unsound practice or practices, specified in the notice of charges served upon the credit union or any institution-affiliated party pursuant to paragraph (1) of subsection (e) of this sec<!-- PDFPage:904 -->tion, or the continuation thereof, is likely to cause insolvency or significant dissipation of assets or earnings of the credit union, or is likely to weaken the condition of the credit union or otherwise prejudice the interests of its insured members prior to the completion of the proceedings conducted pursuant to paragraph (1) of subsection (e) of this section, the Board may issue a temporary order requiring the credit union or such party to cease and desist from any such violation or practice and to take affirmative action to prevent such insolvency, dissipation, condition, or prejudice pending completion of such proceedings. Such order may include any requirement authorized under subsection (e)(3). Such order shall become effective upon service upon the credit union or such institution-affiliated party and, unless set aside, limited, or suspended by a court in proceedings authorized by paragraph (2) of this subsection, shall remain effective and enforceable pending the completion of the administrative proceedings pursuant to such notice and until such time as the Administration shall dismiss the charges specified in such notice, or if a cease-and-desist order is issued against the credit union or such party, until the effective date of such order.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(2) Within ten days after the credit union concerned or any institution-affiliated party has been served with a temporary cease-and-desist order, the credit union or such party may apply to the United States district court for the judicial district in which the home office of the credit union is located, or the United States District Court for the District of Columbia, for an injunction setting aside, limiting, or suspending the enforcement, operation, or effectiveness of such order pending the completion of the administrative proceedings pursuant to the notice of charges served upon the credit union or such party under paragraph (1) of subsection (e) of this section, and such court shall have jurisdiction to issue such injunction.</p>

<p class="statutory-body-3em">(I) the completion of the proceeding initiated under subsection (e)(1) in connection with the notice of charges; or</p>
<p class="statutory-body-3em">(II) the date the Board determines, by examination or otherwise, that the insured credit union's books and records are accurate and reflect the financial condition of the credit union.</p>
<br class="Q04" />
<p class="statutory-body">(4) In the case of violation or threatened violation of, or failure to obey, a temporary cease-and-desist order, the Board may apply to the United States district court, or the United States court of any territory, within the jurisdiction of which the principal office of the credit union is located for an injunction to enforce such order, and, if the court shall determine that there has been such violation or threatened violation or failure to obey, it shall be the duty of the court to issue such injunction.</p>

<p class="statutory-body">(B) Not later than 10 days after the date on which the Board closes a credit union for liquidation pursuant to paragraph (1), or accepts appointment as liquidating agent pursuant to subsection (b), such insured credit union may apply to the United States district court for the judicial district in which the principal office of such insured credit union is located or the United States District Court for the District of Columbia, for an order requiring the Board to show cause why it should not be prohibited from continuing such liquidation.

<p class="statutory-body">(2) Notwithstanding any other provision of law, the Board as liquidating agent of a closed Federal credit union insured under this subchapter shall not be required to furnish bond and shall have the right to appoint an agent or agents to assist it in its duties as such liquidating agent.

Except with respect to the voluntary liquidation of a solvent credit union, such loans shall be made and such accounts shall be established only when, in the opinion of the Board, such action is necessary to protect the fund or the interests of the members of the credit union.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(2) Whenever in the judgment of the Board such action will reduce the risk or avert a threatened loss to the fund and will facilitate a merger or consolidation of an insured credit union with another insured credit union, or will facilitate the sale of the assets of an open or closed insured credit union to and assumption of its liability by another person, the Board may, upon such terms and conditions as it may determine, make loans secured in whole or in part by assets of an open or closed insured credit union, which loans may be in subordination to the rights of members and creditors of such credit union, or the Board may purchase any of such assets or may guarantee any person against loss by reason of its assuming the liabilities and purchasing the assets of an open or closed insured credit union. For purposes of this paragraph, the term &quot;person&quot; means any credit union, individual, partnership, corporation, trust, estate, cooperative, association, government or governmental subdivision or agency, or other entity.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(3) No agreement which tends to diminish or defeat the right, title, or interest of the Board, in any asset acquired by it under this subsection, either as security for a loan or by purchase, shall be valid against the Board unless such agreement&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(A) shall be in writing;</p>

<h4 class="subsection-head">(a) Resolving problems to protect Fund</h4>
<h4 class="paragraph-head">(1) Purpose</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">The purpose of this section is to resolve the problems of insured credit unions at the least possible long-term loss to the Fund.</p>
<h4 class="paragraph-head">(2) Prompt corrective action required</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">The Board shall carry out the purpose of this section by taking prompt corrective action to resolve the problems of insured credit unions.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(b) Regulations required</h4>
<h4 class="paragraph-head">(1) Insured credit unions</h4>
<h4 class="subparagraph-head">(A) In general</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">The Board shall, by regulation, prescribe a system of prompt corrective action for insured credit unions that is&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-3em">(i) consistent with this section; and</p>
<p class="statutory-body-3em">(ii) comparable to section 1831o of this title.</p>
<h4 class="subparagraph-head">(B) Cooperative character of credit unions</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">The Board shall design the system required under subparagraph (A) to take into account that credit unions are not-for-profit cooperatives that&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-3em">(i) do not issue capital stock;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-3em">(ii) must rely on retained earnings to build net worth; and</p>
<p class="statutory-body-3em">(iii) have boards of directors that consist primarily of volunteers.</p>
<h4 class="paragraph-head">(2) New credit unions</h4>
<h4 class="subparagraph-head">(A) In general</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">In addition to regulations under paragraph (1), the Board shall, by regulation, prescribe a system of prompt corrective action that shall apply to new credit unions in lieu of this section and the regulations prescribed under paragraph (1).</p>
<h4 class="subparagraph-head">(B) Criteria for alternative system</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">The Board shall design the system prescribed under subparagraph (A)&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-3em">(i) to carry out the purpose of this section;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-3em">(ii) to recognize that credit unions (as cooperatives that do not issue capital stock) initially have no net worth, and give new credit unions reasonable time to accumulate net worth;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-3em">(iii) to create adequate incentives for new credit unions to become adequately capitalized by the time that they either&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-4em">(I) have been in operation for more than 10 years; or</p>
<p class="statutory-body-4em">(II) have more than $10,000,000 in total assets;</p>
<br class="Q04" />
<p class="statutory-body-3em">(iv) to impose appropriate restrictions and requirements on new credit unions that do not make sufficient progress toward becoming adequately capitalized; and</p>
<p class="statutory-body-3em">(v) to prevent evasion of the purpose of this section.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(c) Net worth categories</h4>
<h4 class="paragraph-head">(1) In general</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">For purposes of this section the following definitions shall apply:</p>
<h4 class="subparagraph-head">(A) Well capitalized</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">An insured credit union is &quot;well capitalized&quot; if&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-3em">(i) it has a net worth ratio of not less than 7 percent; and</p>
<p class="statutory-body-3em">(ii) it meets any applicable risk-based net worth requirement under subsection (d).</p>
<h4 class="subparagraph-head">(B) Adequately capitalized</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">An insured credit union is &quot;adequately capitalized&quot; if&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-3em">(i) it has a net worth ratio of not less than 6 percent; and</p>
<p class="statutory-body-3em">(ii) it meets any applicable risk-based net worth requirement under subsection (d).</p>
<h4 class="subparagraph-head">(C) Undercapitalized</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">An insured credit union is &quot;undercapitalized&quot; if&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-3em">(i) it has a net worth ratio of less than 6 percent; or</p>
<p class="statutory-body-3em">(ii) it fails to meet any applicable risk-based net worth requirement under subsection (d).</p>
<h4 class="subparagraph-head">(D) Significantly undercapitalized</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">An insured credit union is &quot;significantly undercapitalized&quot;&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-3em">(i) if it has a net worth ratio of less than 4 percent; or</p>
<p class="statutory-body-3em">(ii) if&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-4em">(I) it has a net worth ratio of less than 5 percent; and</p>
<p class="statutory-body-4em">(II) it&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-5em">(aa) fails to submit an acceptable net worth restoration plan within the time allowed under subsection (f); or</p>
<p class="statutory-body-5em">(bb) materially fails to implement a net worth restoration plan accepted by the Board.</p>
<h4 class="subparagraph-head">(E) Critically undercapitalized</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">An insured credit union is &quot;critically undercapitalized&quot; if it has a net worth ratio <!-- PDFPage:945 -->of less than 2 percent (or such higher net worth ratio, not to exceed 3 percent, as the Board may specify by regulation).</p>
<h4 class="paragraph-head">(2) Adjusting net worth levels</h4>
<h4 class="subparagraph-head">(A) In general</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">If, for purposes of section 1831o(c) of this title, the Federal banking agencies increase or decrease the required minimum level for the leverage limit (as those terms are used in section 1831o of this title), the Board may, by regulation, and subject to subparagraph (B) of this paragraph, correspondingly increase or decrease 1 or more of the net worth ratios specified in subparagraphs (A) through (D) of paragraph (1) of this subsection in an amount that is equal to not more than the difference between the required minimum level most recently established by the Federal banking agencies and 4 percent of total assets (with respect to institutions regulated by those agencies).</p>
<h4 class="subparagraph-head">(B) Determinations required</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">The Board may increase or decrease net worth ratios under subparagraph (A) only if the Board&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-3em">(i) determines, in consultation with the Federal banking agencies, that the reason for the increase or decrease in the required minimum level for the leverage limit also justifies the adjustment in net worth ratios; and</p>
<p class="statutory-body-3em">(ii) determines that the resulting net worth ratios are sufficient to carry out the purpose of this section.</p>
<h4 class="subparagraph-head">(C) Transition period required</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">If the Board increases any net worth ratio under this paragraph, the Board shall give insured credit unions a reasonable period of time to meet the increased ratio.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(d) Risk-based net worth requirement for complex credit unions</h4>
<h4 class="paragraph-head">(1) In general</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">The regulations required under subsection (b)(1) shall include a risk-based net worth requirement for insured credit unions that are complex, as defined by the Board based on the portfolios of assets and liabilities of credit unions.</p>
<h4 class="paragraph-head">(2) Standard</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">The Board shall design the risk-based net worth requirement to take account of any material risks against which the net worth ratio required for an insured credit union to be adequately capitalized may not provide adequate protection.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(e) Earnings-retention requirement applicable to credit unions that are not well capitalized</h4>
<h4 class="paragraph-head">(1) In general</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">An insured credit union that is not well capitalized shall annually set aside as net worth an amount equal to not less than 0.4 percent of its total assets.</p>
<h4 class="paragraph-head">(2) Board's authority to decrease earnings-retention requirement</h4>
<h4 class="subparagraph-head">(A) In general</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">The Board may, by order, decrease the 0.4 percent requirement in paragraph (1) with respect to a credit union to the extent that the Board determines that the decrease&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-3em">(i) is necessary to avoid a significant redemption of shares; and</p>
<p class="statutory-body-3em">(ii) would further the purpose of this section.</p>
<h4 class="subparagraph-head">(B) Periodic review required</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">The Board shall periodically review any order issued under subparagraph (A).</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(f) Net worth restoration plan required</h4>
<h4 class="paragraph-head">(1) In general</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">Each insured credit union that is undercapitalized shall submit an acceptable net worth restoration plan to the Board within the time allowed under this subsection.</p>
<h4 class="paragraph-head">(2) Assistance to small credit unions</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">The Board (or the staff of the Board) shall, upon timely request by an insured credit union with total assets of less than $10,000,000, and subject to such regulations or guidelines as the Board may prescribe, assist that credit union in preparing a net worth restoration plan.</p>
<h4 class="paragraph-head">(3) Deadlines for submission and review of plans</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">The Board shall, by regulation, establish deadlines for submission of net worth restoration plans under this subsection that&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(A) provide insured credit unions with reasonable time to submit net worth restoration plans; and</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(B) require the Board to act on net worth restoration plans expeditiously.</p>
<h4 class="paragraph-head">(4) Failure to submit acceptable plan within time allowed</h4>
<h4 class="subparagraph-head">(A) Failure to submit any plan</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">If an insured credit union fails to submit a net worth restoration plan within the time allowed under paragraph (3), the Board shall&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-3em">(i) promptly notify the credit union of that failure; and</p>
<p class="statutory-body-3em">(ii) give the credit union a reasonable opportunity to submit a net worth restoration plan.</p>
<h4 class="subparagraph-head">(B) Submission of unacceptable plan</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">If an insured credit union submits a net worth restoration plan within the time allowed under paragraph (3), and the Board determines that the plan is not acceptable, the Board shall&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-3em">(i) promptly notify the credit union of why the plan is not acceptable; and</p>
<p class="statutory-body-3em">(ii) give the credit union a reasonable opportunity to submit a revised plan.</p>
<h4 class="paragraph-head">(5) Accepting plan</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">The Board may accept a net worth restoration plan only if the Board determines that the plan is based on realistic assumptions and is likely to succeed in restoring the net worth of the credit union.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(g) Restrictions on undercapitalized credit unions</h4>
<h4 class="paragraph-head">(1) Restriction on asset growth</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">An insured credit union that is undercapitalized shall not generally permit its average total assets to increase, unless&mdash;</p>
<!-- PDFPage:946 --><p class="statutory-body-2em">(A) the Board has accepted the net worth restoration plan of the credit union for that action;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(B) any increase in total assets is consistent with the net worth restoration plan; and</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(C) the net worth ratio of the credit union increases at a rate that is consistent with the net worth restoration plan.</p>
<h4 class="paragraph-head">(2) Restriction on member business loans</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">Notwithstanding section 1757a(a) of this title, an insured credit union that is undercapitalized may not make any increase in the total amount of member business loans (as defined in section 1757a(c) of this title) outstanding at that credit union at any one time, until such time as the credit union becomes adequately capitalized.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(h) More stringent treatment based on other supervisory criteria</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">With respect to the exercise of authority by the Board under regulations comparable to section 1831o(g) of this title&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(1) the Board may not reclassify an insured credit union into a lower net worth category, or treat an insured credit union as if it were in a lower net worth category, for reasons not pertaining to the safety and soundness of that credit union; and</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(2) the Board may not delegate its authority to reclassify an insured credit union into a lower net worth category or to treat an insured credit union as if it were in a lower net worth category.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(i) Action required regarding critically undercapitalized credit unions</h4>
<h4 class="paragraph-head">(1) In general</h4>

<p class="statutory-body-2em">(B) take such other action as the Board determines would better achieve the purpose of this section, after documenting why the action would better achieve that purpose.</p>
<h4 class="paragraph-head">(2) Periodic redeterminations required</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">Any determination by the Board under paragraph (1)(B) to take any action with respect to an insured credit union in lieu of appointing a conservator or liquidating agent shall cease to be effective not later than the end of the 180-day period beginning on the date on which the determination is made, and a conservator or liquidating agent shall be appointed for that credit union under paragraph (1)(A), unless the Board makes a new determination under paragraph (1)(B) before the end of the effective period of the prior determination.</p>

<h3 class="section-head">&sect;1790e. Temporary Corporate Credit Union Stabilization Fund</h3>
<!-- field-end:head -->
<!-- field-start:statute -->
<h4 class="subsection-head">(a) Establishment of Stabilization Fund</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">There is hereby created in the Treasury of the United States a fund to be known as the &quot;Temporary Corporate Credit Union Stabilization Fund.&quot; The Board will administer the Stabilization Fund as prescribed by section 1789 of this title.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(b) Expenditures from Stabilization Fund</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">Money in the Stabilization Fund shall be available upon requisition by the Board, without fiscal year limitation, for making payments for the purposes described in section 1783(a) of this title, subject to the following additional limitations:</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(1) All payments other than administrative payments shall be connected to the conservatorship, liquidation, or threatened conservatorship or liquidation, of a corporate credit union.</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(2) Prior to authorizing each payment the Board shall&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(A) certify that, absent the existence of the Stabilization Fund, the Board would have made the identical payment out of the National Credit Union Share Insurance Fund (Insurance Fund); and</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(B) report each such certification to the Committee on Banking, Housing, and Urban Affairs of the Senate and the Committee on Financial Services of the House of Representatives.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(c) Authority to borrow</h4>
<h4 class="paragraph-head">(1) In general</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">The Stabilization Fund is authorized to borrow from the Secretary of the Treasury from time-to-time as deemed necessary by the Board. The maximum outstanding amount of all borrowings from the Treasury by the Stabilization Fund and the National Credit Union Share Insurance Fund, combined, is limited to the amount provided for in section 1783(d)(1) of this title, including any authorized increases in that amount.</p>
<h4 class="paragraph-head">(2) Repayment of advances</h4>
<h4 class="subparagraph-head">(A) In general</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">The advances made under this section shall be repaid by the Stabilization Fund, and interest on such advance shall be paid, to the General fund of the Treasury.</p>
<h4 class="subparagraph-head">(B) Variable rate of interest</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">The Secretary of the Treasury shall make the first rate determination at the time of the first advance under this section and shall reset the rate again for all advances on each anniversary of the first advance. The interest rate shall be equal to the average market yield on outstanding marketable obligations of the United States with remaining periods to maturity equal to 12 months.</p>
<h4 class="paragraph-head">(3) Repayment schedule</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">The Stabilization Fund shall repay the advances on a first-in, first-out basis, with interest on the amount repaid, at times and dates determined by the Board at its discretion. All advances shall be repaid not later than the date of the seventh anniversary of the first advance to the Stabilization Fund, unless the Board extends this final repayment date. The Board shall obtain the concurrence of the Secretary of the Treasury on any proposed extension, including the terms and conditions of the extended repayment and any additional advances.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(d) Assessment authority</h4>
<h4 class="paragraph-head">(1) Assessments relating to expenditures under subsection (b)</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">In order to make expenditures, as described in subsection (b), the Board may assess a special premium with respect to each insured credit union in an aggregate amount that is reasonably calculated to make any pending or <!-- PDFPage:950 -->future expenditure described in subsection (b), which premium shall be due and payable not later than 60 days after the date of the assessment. In setting the amount of any assessment under this subsection, the Board shall take into consideration any potential impact on credit union earnings that such an assessment may have.</p>
<h4 class="paragraph-head">(2) Special premiums relating to repayments under subsection (c)(3)</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">Not later than 90 days before the scheduled date of each repayment described in subsection (c)(3), the Board shall set the amount of the upcoming repayment and shall determine whether the Stabilization Fund will have sufficient funds to make the repayment. If the Stabilization Fund is not likely to have sufficient funds to make the repayment, the Board shall assess with respect to each insured credit union a special premium, which shall be due and payable not later than 60 days after the date of the assessment, in an aggregate amount calculated to ensure that the Stabilization Fund is able to make the required repayment.</p>
<h4 class="paragraph-head">(3) Computation</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">Any assessment or premium charge for an insured credit union under this subsection shall be stated as a percentage of its insured shares, as represented on the previous call report of that insured credit union. The percentage shall be identical for each insured credit union. Any insured credit union that fails to make timely payment of the assessment or special premium is subject to the procedures and penalties described under subsections (d), (e), and (f) of section 1782 of this title.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(e) Distributions from Insurance Fund</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">At the end of any calendar year in which the Stabilization Fund has an outstanding advance from the Treasury, the Insurance Fund is prohibited from making the distribution to insured credit unions described in section 1782(c)(3) of this title. In lieu of the distribution described in that section, the Insurance Fund shall make a distribution to the Stabilization Fund of the maximum amount possible that does not reduce the Insurance Fund's equity ratio below the normal operating level and does not reduce the Insurance Fund's available assets ratio below 1.0 percent.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(f) Investment of Stabilization Fund assets</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">The Board may request the Secretary of the Treasury to invest such portion of the Stabilization Fund as is not, in the Board's judgment, required to meet the current needs of the Stabilization Fund. Such investments shall be made by the Secretary of the Treasury in public debt securities, with maturities suitable to the needs of the Stabilization Fund, as determined by the Board, and bearing interest at a rate determined by the Secretary of the Treasury, taking into consideration current market yields on outstanding marketable obligations of the United States of comparable maturity.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(g) Reports</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">The Board shall submit an annual report to Congress on the financial condition and the results of the operation of the Stabilization Fund. The report is due to Congress within 30 days after each anniversary of the first advance made under subsection (c)(1). Because the Fund will use advances from the Treasury to meet corporate stabilization costs with full repayment of borrowings to Treasury at the Board's discretion not due until 7 years from the initial advance, to the extent operating expenses of the Fund exceed income, the financial condition of the Fund may reflect a deficit. With planned and required future repayments, the Board shall resolve all deficits prior to termination of the Fund.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(h) Closing of Stabilization Fund</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">Within 90 days following the seventh anniversary of the initial Stabilization Fund advance, or earlier at the Board's discretion, the Board shall distribute any funds, property, or other assets remaining in the Stabilization Fund to the Insurance Fund and shall close the Stabilization Fund. If the Board extends the final repayment date as permitted under subsection (c)(3), the mandatory date for closing the Stabilization Fund shall be extended by the same number of days.</p>
