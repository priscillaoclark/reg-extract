<h4 class="subsection-head">(b) Procedure for recommendations to regulators</h4>
<h4 class="paragraph-head">(1) Notice and opportunity for comment</h4>

<h4 class="subparagraph-head">(B) Rule of construction</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">The authority under this paragraph is in addition to, and does not limit, any other authority of a primary financial regulatory agency.

<h4 class="paragraph-head">(2) Imposition of standards</h4>

<h4 class="subsection-head">(e) Effect of rescission of identification</h4>
<h4 class="paragraph-head">(1) Notice</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">The Council may recommend to the relevant primary financial regulatory agency that a financial activity or practice no longer requires any standards or safeguards implemented under this section.</p>
