<p class="note-body">Section 4201 of this title, referred to in subsec. (a), was in the original &quot;section 811&quot;, and was translated as reading &quot;section 2561&quot;, meaning section 2561 of Pub. L. 101&ndash;647, as the probable intent of Congress, because Pub. L. 101&ndash;647 does not contain a section 811.</p>
