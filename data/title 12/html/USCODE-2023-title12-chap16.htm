<p class="statutory-body-1em">(6) the convenience and needs of the community to be served by the branch,</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(7) whether or not its corporate powers, insofar as they will be exercised through the proposed insured branch, are consistent with the purposes of this chapter, and</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(8) the probable adequacy and reliability of information supplied and to be supplied by the bank to the Corporation to enable it to carry out its functions under this chapter.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(c) Protection to Deposit Insurance Fund; surety bond, pledge of assets, etc.; injunction</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">(1) Before any branch of a foreign bank becomes an insured branch, the bank shall deliver to the Corporation or as the Corporation may direct a surety bond, a pledge of assets, or both, in such amounts and of such types as the Corporation may require or approve, for the purpose set forth in paragraph (4) of this subsection.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(2) After any branch of a foreign bank becomes an insured branch, the bank shall maintain on deposit with the Corporation, or as the Corporation may direct, surety bonds or assets or both, in such amounts and of such types as shall be determined from time to time in accordance with such regulations as the Board of Directors may prescribe. Such regulations may impose differing requirements on the basis of any factors which in the judgment of the Board of Directors are reasonably related to the purpose set forth in paragraph (4).</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(3) The Corporation may require of any given bank larger deposits of bonds and assets than required under paragraph (2) of this subsection if, in the judgment of the Corporation, the situation of that bank or any branch thereof is or becomes such that the deposits of bonds and assets otherwise required under this section would not adequately fulfill the purpose set forth in paragraph (4). The imposition of any such additional requirements may be without notice or opportunity for hearing, but the Corporation shall afford an opportunity to any such bank to apply for a reduction or removal of any such additional requirements so imposed.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(4) The purpose of the surety bonds and pledges of assets required under this subsection is to provide protection to the Deposit Insurance Fund against the risks entailed in insuring the domestic deposits of a foreign bank whose activities, assets, and personnel are in large part outside the jurisdiction of the United States. In the implementation of its authority under this subsection, however, the Corporation shall endeavor to avoid imposing requirements on such banks which would unnecessarily place them at a competitive disadvantage in relation to domestically incorporated banks.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(5) In the case of any failure or threatened failure of a foreign bank to comply with any requirement imposed under this subsection (c), the Corporation, in addition to all other administrative and judicial remedies, may apply to any United States district court, or United States court of any territory, within the jurisdiction of which any branch of the bank is located, for an injunction to compel such bank and any officer, employee, or agent thereof, or any other person having custody or control of any of its assets, to deliver to the Corporation such assets as may be necessary to meet such requirement, and to take any other action necessary to vest the Corporation with control of assets so delivered. If the court shall determine that there has been any such failure or threatened failure to comply with any such requirement, it shall be the duty of the court to issue such injunction. The propriety of the requirement may be litigated only as provided in chapter 7 of title 5, and may not be made an issue in an action for an injunction under this paragraph.</p>

The amount of trust funds held in the depository institution's own trust department, which the reporting depository institution keeps segregated and apart from its general assets and does not use in the conduct of its business, shall not be included in the total deposits in such reports, but shall be separately stated in such reports. Deposits which are accumulated for the payment of personal loans and are assigned or pledged to assure payment of loans at maturity shall not be included in the total deposits in such reports, but shall be deducted from the loans for which such deposits are assigned or pledged to assure repayment.</p>

<br class="Q04" />
<p class="statutory-body-block-2em" style="padding-left:2em text-indent:0em">the Board of Directors shall notify the appropriate Federal banking agency with respect to such institution (if other than the Corporation) or the State banking supervisor of such institution (if the Corporation is the appropriate Federal banking agency) of the Board's determination and the facts and circumstances on which such determination is based for the purpose of securing the correction of such practice, condition, or violation. Such notice shall be given to the appropriate Federal banking agency not less than 30 days before the notice required by subparagraph (B), except that this period for notice to the appropriate Federal banking agency may be reduced or eliminated with the agreement of such agency.</p>
<h4 class="subparagraph-head">(B) Notice of intention to terminate insurance</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">If, after giving the notice required under subparagraph (A) with respect to an insured depository institution, the Board of Directors determines that any unsafe or unsound practice or condition or any violation specified in such notice requires the termination of the insured status of the insured depository institution, the Board shall&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-3em">(i) serve written notice to the insured depository institution of the Board's intention to terminate the insured status of the institution;</p>

<h4 class="paragraph-head">(3) Hearing; termination</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">If, on the basis of the evidence presented at a hearing before the Board of Directors (or any person designated by the Board for such purpose), in which all issues shall be determined on the record pursuant to section 554 of title 5 and the written findings of the Board of Directors (or such person) with respect to such evidence (which shall be conclusive), the Board of Directors finds that any unsafe or unsound practice or condition or any violation specified in the notice to an insured depository institution under paragraph (2)(B) or subsection (w) has been established, the Board of Directors may issue an order terminating the insured status of such depository institution effective as of a date subsequent to such finding.</p>
<h4 class="paragraph-head">(4) Appearance; consent to termination</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">Unless the depository institution shall appear at the hearing by a duly authorized representative, it shall be deemed to have consented to the termination of its status as an insured depository institution and termination of such status thereupon may be ordered.</p>
<h4 class="paragraph-head">(5) Judicial review</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">Any insured depository institution whose insured status has been terminated by order of the Board of Directors under this subsection shall have the right of judicial review of such order only to the same extent as provided for the review of orders under subsection (h) of this section.</p>
<h4 class="paragraph-head">(6) Publication of notice of termination</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">The Corporation may publish notice of such termination and the depository institution shall give notice of such termination to each of its depositors at his last address of record on the books of the depository institution, in such manner and at such time as the Board of Directors may find to be necessary and may order for the protection of depositors.</p>
<h4 class="paragraph-head">(7) Temporary insurance of deposits insured as of termination</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">After the termination of the insured status of any depository institution under the provisions of this subsection, the insured deposits of each depositor in the depository institution on the date of such termination, less all subsequent withdrawals from any deposits of such depositor, shall continue for a period of at least 6 months or up to 2 years, within the discretion of the Board of Directors, to be in<!-- PDFPage:1008 -->sured, and the depository institution shall continue to pay to the Corporation assessments as in the case of an insured depository institution during such period. No additions to any such deposits and no new deposits in such depository institution made after the date of such termination shall be insured by the Corporation, and the depository institution shall not advertise or hold itself out as having insured deposits unless in the same connection it shall also state with equal prominence that such additions to deposits and new deposits made after such date are not so insured. Such depository institution shall, in all other respects, be subject to the duties and obligations of an insured depository institution for the period referred to in the 1st sentence from the date of such termination, and in the event that such depository institution shall be closed on account of inability to meet the demands of its depositors within such period, the Corporation shall have the same powers and rights with respect to such depository institution as in case of an insured depository institution.</p>
<h4 class="paragraph-head">(8) Temporary suspension of insurance</h4>
<h4 class="subparagraph-head">(A) In general</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">If the Board of Directors initiates a termination proceeding under paragraph (2), and the Board of Directors, after consultation with the appropriate Federal banking agency, finds that an insured depository institution (other than a savings association to which subparagraph (B) applies) has no tangible capital under the capital guidelines or regulations of the appropriate Federal banking agency, the Corporation may issue a temporary order suspending deposit insurance on all deposits received by the institution.</p>
<h4 class="subparagraph-head">(B) Special rule for certain savings institutions</h4>
<h4 class="clause-head">(i) Certain goodwill included in tangible capital</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-3em">In determining the tangible capital of a savings association for purposes of this paragraph, the Board of Directors shall include goodwill to the extent it is considered a component of capital under section 1464(t) of this title. Any savings association which would be subject to a suspension order under subparagraph (A) but for the operation of this subparagraph, shall be considered by the Corporation to be a &quot;special supervisory association&quot;.</p>
<h4 class="clause-head">(ii) Suspension order</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-3em">The Corporation may issue a temporary order suspending deposit insurance on all deposits received by a special supervisory association whenever the Board of Directors determines that&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-4em">(I) the capital of such association, as computed utilizing applicable accounting standards, has suffered a material decline;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-4em">(II) that such association (or its directors or officers) is engaging in an unsafe or unsound practice in conducting the business of the association;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-4em">(III) that such association is in an unsafe or unsound condition to continue operating as an insured association; or</p>
<p class="statutory-body-4em">(IV) that such association (or its directors or officers) has violated any applicable law, rule, regulation, or order, or any condition imposed in writing by a Federal banking agency, or any written agreement including a capital improvement plan entered into with any Federal banking agency, or that the association has failed to enter into a capital improvement plan which is acceptable to the Corporation within the time period set forth in section 1464(t) of this title.</p>
<br class="Q04" />
<p class="statutory-body-flush2_hang3">&#160;Nothing in this paragraph limits the right of the Corporation or the Comptroller of the Currency to enforce a contractual provision which authorizes the Corporation or the Comptroller of the Currency, as a successor to the Federal Savings and Loan Insurance Corporation or the Federal Home Loan Bank Board, to require a savings association to write down or amortize goodwill at a faster rate than otherwise required under this chapter or under applicable accounting standards.</p>
<h4 class="subparagraph-head">(C) Effective period of temporary order</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">Any order issued under subparagraph (A) shall become effective not earlier than 10 days from the date of service upon the institution and, unless set aside, limited, or suspended by a court in proceedings authorized hereunder, such temporary order shall remain effective and enforceable until an order of the Board under paragraph (3) becomes final or until the Corporation dismisses the proceedings under paragraph (3).</p>
<h4 class="subparagraph-head">(D) Judicial review</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">Before the close of the 10-day period beginning on the date any temporary order has been served upon an insured depository institution under subparagraph (A), such institution may apply to the United States District Court for the District of Columbia, or the United States district court for the judicial district in which the home office of the institution is located, for an injunction setting aside, limiting, or suspending the enforcement, operation, or effectiveness of such order, and such court shall have jurisdiction to issue such injunction.</p>
<h4 class="subparagraph-head">(E) Continuation of insurance for prior deposits</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">The insured deposits of each depositor in such depository institution on the effective date of the order issued under this paragraph, minus all subsequent withdrawals from any deposits of such depositor, shall continue to be insured, subject to the administrative proceedings as provided in this chapter.</p>
<h4 class="subparagraph-head">(F) Publication of order</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">The depository institution shall give notice of such order to each of its depositors in such manner and at such times as the Board of Directors may find to be necessary and may order for the protection of depositors.</p>
<!-- PDFPage:1009 --><h4 class="subparagraph-head">(G) Notice by Corporation</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">If the Corporation determines that the depository institution has not substantially complied with the notice to depositors required by the Board of Directors, the Corporation may provide such notice in such manner as the Board of Directors may find to be necessary and appropriate.</p>
<h4 class="subparagraph-head">(H) Lack of notice</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">Notwithstanding subparagraph (A), any deposit made after the effective date of a suspension order issued under this paragraph shall remain insured to the extent that the depositor establishes that&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-3em">(i) such deposit consists of additions made by automatic deposit the depositor was unable to prevent; or</p>
<p class="statutory-body-3em">(ii) such depositor did not have actual knowledge of the suspension of insurance.</p>
<h4 class="paragraph-head">(9) Final decisions to terminate insurance</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">Any decision by the Board of Directors to&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(A) issue a temporary order terminating deposit insurance; or</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(B) issue a final order terminating deposit insurance (other than under subsection (p) or (q));</p>
<br class="Q04" />
<p class="statutory-body-block-1em">shall be made by the Board of Directors and may not be delegated.</p>
<h4 class="paragraph-head">(10) Low- to moderate-income housing lender</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">In making any determination regarding the termination of insurance of a solvent savings association, the Corporation may consider the extent of the association's low- to moderate-income housing loans.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(b) Cease-and-desist proceedings</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">(1) If, in the opinion of the appropriate Federal banking agency, any insured depository institution, depository institution which has insured deposits, or any institution-affiliated party is engaging or has engaged, or the agency has reasonable cause to believe that the depository institution or any institution-affiliated party is about to engage, in an unsafe or unsound practice in conducting the business of such depository institution, or is violating or has violated, or the agency has reasonable cause to believe that the depository institution or any institution-affiliated party is about to violate, a law, rule, or regulation, or any condition imposed in writing by a Federal banking agency in connection with any action on any application, notice, or other request by the depository institution or institution-affiliated party, or any written agreement entered into with the agency, the appropriate Federal banking agency for the depository institution may issue and serve upon the depository institution or such party a notice of charges in respect thereof. The notice shall contain a statement of the facts constituting the alleged violation or violations or the unsafe or unsound practice or practices, and shall fix a time and place at which a hearing will be held to determine whether an order to cease and desist therefrom should issue against the depository institution or the institution-affiliated party. Such hearing shall be fixed for a date not earlier than thirty days nor later than sixty days after service of such notice unless an earlier or a later date is set by the agency at the request of any party so served. Unless the party or parties so served shall appear at the hearing personally or by a duly authorized representative, they shall be deemed to have consented to the issuance of the cease-and-desist order. In the event of such consent, or if upon the record made at any such hearing, the agency shall find that any violation or unsafe or unsound practice specified in the notice of charges has been established, the agency may issue and serve upon the depository institution or the institution-affiliated party an order to cease and desist from any such violation or practice. Such order may, by provisions which may be mandatory or otherwise, require the depository institution or its institution-affiliated parties to cease and desist from the same, and, further, to take affirmative action to correct the conditions resulting from any such violation or practice.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(2) A cease-and-desist order shall become effective at the expiration of thirty days after the service of such order upon the depository institution or other person concerned (except in the case of a cease-and-desist order issued upon consent, which shall become effective at the time specified therein), and shall remain effective and enforceable as provided therein, except to such extent as it is stayed, modified, terminated, or set aside by action of the agency or a reviewing court.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(3) This subsection, subsections (c) through (s) and subsection (u) of this section, and section 1831aa of this title shall apply to any bank holding company, and to any subsidiary (other than a bank) of a bank holding company, as those terms are defined in the Bank Holding Company Act of 1956 [12 U.S.C. 1841 et seq.], any savings and loan holding company and any subsidiary (other than a depository institution) of a savings and loan holding company (as such terms are defined in section 1467a of this title)),<sup><a href="#1818_2_target" name="1818_2">2</a></sup> any noninsured State member bank and to any organization organized and operated under section 25(a)&#160;<sup><a href="#1818_1_target" name="1818_1">1</a></sup> of the Federal Reserve Act [12 U.S.C. 611 et seq.] or operating under section 25 of the Federal Reserve Act [12 U.S.C. 601 et seq.], in the same manner as they apply to a State member insured bank. Nothing in this subsection or in subsection (c) of this section shall authorize any Federal banking agency, other than the Board of Governors of the Federal Reserve System, to issue a notice of charges or cease-and-desist order against a bank holding company or any subsidiary thereof (other than a bank or subsidiary of that bank) or against a savings and loan holding company or any subsidiary thereof (other than a depository institution or a subsidiary of such depository institution).</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(4) This subsection, subsections (c) through (s) and subsection (u) of this section, and section 1831aa of this title shall apply to any foreign bank or company to which subsection (a) of section 3106 of this title applies and to any subsidiary (other than a bank) of any such foreign bank or company in the same manner as they apply to a bank holding company and any subsidiary thereof (other than a bank) under para<!-- PDFPage:1010 -->graph (3) of this subsection. For the purposes of this paragraph, the term &quot;subsidiary&quot; shall have the meaning assigned to it in section 2 of the Bank Holding Company Act of 1956 [12 U.S.C. 1841].</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(5) This section shall apply, in the same manner as it applies to any insured depository institution for which the appropriate Federal banking agency is the Comptroller of the Currency, to any national banking association chartered by the Comptroller of the Currency, including an uninsured association.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(6) <cap-smallcap>Affirmative action to correct conditions resulting from violations or practices</cap-smallcap>.&mdash;The authority to issue an order under this subsection and subsection (c) which requires an insured depository institution or any institution-affiliated party to take affirmative action to correct or remedy any conditions resulting from any violation or practice with respect to which such order is issued includes the authority to require such depository institution or such party to&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(A) make restitution or provide reimbursement, indemnification, or guarantee against loss if&mdash;</p>

<p class="statutory-body">(7) <cap-smallcap>Authority to limit activities</cap-smallcap>.&mdash;The authority to issue an order under this subsection or subsection (c) includes the authority to place limitations on the activities or functions of an insured depository institution or any institution-affiliated party.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(8) <cap-smallcap>Unsatisfactory asset quality, management, earnings, or liquidity as unsafe or unsound practice</cap-smallcap>.&mdash;If an insured depository institution receives, in its most recent report of examination, a less-than-satisfactory rating for asset quality, management, earnings, or liquidity, the appropriate Federal banking agency may (if the deficiency is not corrected) deem the institution to be engaging in an unsafe or unsound practice for purposes of this subsection.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(9) [Repealed]</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(10) <cap-smallcap>Standard for certain orders</cap-smallcap>.&mdash;No authority under this subsection or subsection (c) to prohibit any institution-affiliated party from withdrawing, transferring, removing, dissipating, or disposing of any funds, assets, or other property may be exercised unless the appropriate Federal banking agency meets the standards of Rule 65 of the Federal Rules of Civil Procedure, without regard to the requirement of such rule that the applicant show that the injury, loss, or damage is irreparable and immediate.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(c) Temporary cease-and-desist orders</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">(1) Whenever the appropriate Federal banking agency shall determine that the violation or threatened violation or the unsafe or unsound practice or practices, specified in the notice of charges served upon the depository institution or any institution-affiliated party pursuant to paragraph (1) of subsection (b) of this section, or the continuation thereof, is likely to cause insolvency or significant dissipation of assets or earnings of the depository institution, or is likely to weaken the condition of the depository institution or otherwise prejudice the interests of its depositors prior to the completion of the proceedings conducted pursuant to paragraph (1) of subsection (b) of this section, the agency may issue a temporary order requiring the depository institution or such party to cease and desist from any such violation or practice and to take affirmative action to prevent or remedy such insolvency, dissipation, condition, or prejudice pending completion of such proceedings. Such order may include any requirement authorized under subsection (b)(6). Such order shall become effective upon service upon the depository institution or such institution-affiliated party and, unless set aside, limited, or suspended by a court in proceedings authorized by paragraph (2) of this subsection, shall remain effective and enforceable pending the completion of the administrative proceedings pursuant to such notice and until such time as the agency shall dismiss the charges specified in such notice, or if a cease-and-desist order is issued against the depository institution or such party, until the effective date of such order.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(2) Within ten days after the depository institution concerned or any institution-affiliated party has been served with a temporary cease-and-desist order, the depository institution or such party may apply to the United States district court for the judicial district in which the home office of the depository institution is located, or the United States District Court for the District of Columbia, for an injunction setting aside, limiting, or suspending the enforcement, operation, or effectiveness of such order pending the completion of the administrative proceedings pursuant to the notice of charges served upon the depository institution or such party under paragraph (1) of subsection (b) of this section, and such court shall have jurisdiction to issue such injunction.</p>

<p class="statutory-body-2em">(i) the cessation of any activity or practice which gave rise, whether in whole or in part, to the incomplete or inaccurate state of the books or records; or</p>

<p class="statutory-body-3em">(II) the date the appropriate Federal banking agency determines, by examination or otherwise, that the insured depository institution's books and records are accurate and reflect the financial condition of the depository institution.</p>

<h4 class="subsection-head">(d) Withholding payments to meet liability to depository institution</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">The Corporation may withhold payment of such portion of the insured deposit of any depositor in a depository institution in default as may be required to provide for the payment of any liability of such depositor to the depository institution in default or its receiver, which is not offset against a claim due from such depository institution, pending the determination and payment of such liability by such depositor or any other person liable therefor.</p>

<h4 class="paragraph-head">(3) Refusal of appropriate State to accept custody</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">If the appropriate State declines to accept custody of the deposit tendered pursuant to paragraph (2)(B), the deposit shall not be delivered to any State, and the insured depositor shall claim the deposit from the Corporation before the receivership is terminated, or all rights of the depositor with respect to such deposit shall be barred.</p>
<h4 class="paragraph-head">(4) Treatment of United States deposits</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">If the deposit is a United States deposit it shall be delivered to the Secretary of the Treasury for deposit in the general fund of the Treasury. Upon delivery to the Secretary of the Treasury, all rights of the depositor against the Corporation with respect to the deposit shall be barred and the Corporation shall be deemed to have made payment to the depositor for purposes of section 1821(g)(1) of this title.</p>
<h4 class="paragraph-head">(5) Reversion</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">If a depositor does not claim the deposit delivered to the custody of the appropriate State pursuant to paragraph (2)(B) within 10 years of the date of delivery, the deposit shall be immediately refunded to the Corporation and become its property. All rights of the depositor against the appropriate State with respect to such deposit shall be barred as of the date of the refund to the Corporation.</p>

<br class="Q04" />
<p class="statutory-body">(5) The responsible agency shall not approve&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(A) any proposed merger transaction which would result in a monopoly, or which would be in furtherance of any combination or conspiracy to monopolize or to attempt to monopolize the business of banking in any part of the United States, or</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(B) any other proposed merger transaction whose effect in any section of the country may be substantially to lessen competition, or to tend to create a monopoly, or which in any <!-- PDFPage:1111 -->other manner would be in restraint of trade, unless it finds that the anticompetitive effects of the proposed transaction are clearly outweighed in the public interest by the probable effect of the transaction in meeting the convenience and needs of the community to be served.</p>
<br class="Q04" />
<p class="statutory-body-block">In every case, the responsible agency shall take into consideration the financial and managerial resources and future prospects of the existing and proposed institutions, the convenience and needs of the community to be served, and the risk to the stability of the United States banking or financial system.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(6) The responsible agency shall immediately notify the Attorney General of any approval by it pursuant to this subsection of a proposed merger transaction. If the agency has found that it must act immediately to prevent the probable failure of one of the insured depository institutions involved, or if the proposed merger transaction is solely between an insured depository institution and 1 or more of its affiliates, and the report on the competitive factors has been dispensed with, the transaction may be consummated immediately upon approval by the agency. If the agency has advised the Attorney General under paragraph (4)(B)(ii) of the existence of an emergency requiring expeditious action and has requested a report on the competitive factors within 10 days, the transaction may not be consummated before the fifth calendar day after the date of approval by the agency. In all other cases, the transaction may not be consummated before the thirtieth calendar day after the date of approval by the agency or, if the agency has not received any adverse comment from the Attorney General of the United States relating to competitive factors, such shorter period of time as may be prescribed by the agency with the concurrence of the Attorney General, but in no event less than 15 calendar days after the date of approval.</p>

The commencement of such an action shall stay the effectiveness of the agency's approval unless the court shall otherwise specifically order. In any such action, the court shall review de novo the issues presented.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(B) In any judicial proceeding attacking a merger transaction approved under paragraph (5) on the ground that the merger transaction alone and of itself constituted a violation of any antitrust laws other than section 2 of title 15, the standards applied by the court shall be identical with those that the banking agencies are directed to apply under paragraph (5).</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(C) Upon the consummation of a merger transaction in compliance with this subsection and after the termination of any antitrust litigation commenced within the period prescribed in this paragraph, or upon the termination of such period if no such litigation is commenced therein, the transaction may not thereafter be attacked in any judicial proceeding on the ground that it alone and of itself constituted a violation of any antitrust laws other than section 2 of title 15, but nothing in this subsection shall exempt any bank or savings association resulting from a merger transaction from complying with the antitrust laws after the consummation of such transaction.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(D) In any action brought under the antitrust laws arising out of a merger transaction approved by a Federal supervisory agency pursuant to this subsection, such agency, and any State banking supervisory agency having jurisdiction within the State involved, may appear as a part of its own motion and as of right, and be represented by its counsel.</p>

<p class="statutory-body-1em">(A) the name and total resources of each bank or savings association involved;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(B) whether a report was submitted by the Attorney General under paragraph (4), and, if so, a summary by the Attorney General of the substance of such report; and</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(C) a statement by the responsible agency of the basis for its approval.</p>
<br class="Q04" />
<p class="statutory-body">(10) Until June 30, 1976, the responsible agency shall not grant any approval required by law which has the practical effect of permitting a conversion from the mutual to the stock form of organization, including approval of any application pending on the date of enactment of this subsection, except that this sentence shall not be deemed to limit now or hereafter the authority of the responsible agency to grant approvals in cases where the responsible agency finds that it must act in order to maintain the safety, soundness, and stability of an insured depository institution. The responsible agency may by rule, regulation, or otherwise and under such civil penalties (which shall be cumulative to any other remedies) as it may prescribe take whatever action it deems necessary or appropriate to implement or enforce this subsection.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(11) <cap-smallcap>Money laundering</cap-smallcap>.&mdash;In every case, the responsible agency, shall take into consideration the effectiveness of any insured depository institution involved in the proposed merger transaction in combatting money laundering activities, including in overseas branches.</p>

<!-- field-end:head -->
<!-- field-start:statute -->
<h4 class="subsection-head">(a) Congressional findings and declaration of purpose</h4>
<h4 class="paragraph-head">(1) Findings</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">Congress finds that&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(A) adequate records maintained by insured depository institutions have a high degree of usefulness in criminal, tax, and regulatory investigations or proceedings, and that, given the threat posed to the security of the Nation on and after the terrorist attacks against the United States on September 11, 2001, such records may also have a high degree of usefulness in the conduct of intelligence or counterintelligence activities, including analysis, to protect against domestic and international terrorism; and</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(B) microfilm or other reproductions and other records made by insured depository institutions of checks, as well as records kept by such institutions, of the identity of persons maintaining or authorized to act with respect to accounts therein, have been of particular value in proceedings described in subparagraph (A).</p>
<h4 class="paragraph-head">(2) Purpose</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">It is the purpose of this section to require the maintenance of appropriate types of records by insured depository institutions in the United States where such records have a high degree of usefulness in criminal, tax, or regulatory investigations or proceedings, recognizing that, given the threat posed to the security of the Nation on and after the terrorist attacks against the United States on September 11, 2001, such records may also have a high degree of usefulness in the conduct of intelligence or counterintelligence activities, including analysis, to protect against international terrorism.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(b) Recordkeeping regulations</h4>
<h4 class="paragraph-head">(1) In general</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">Where the Secretary of the Treasury (referred to in this section as the &quot;Secretary&quot;) determines that the maintenance of appropriate types of records and other evidence by insured depository institutions has a high degree of usefulness in criminal, tax, or regulatory investigations or proceedings, he shall prescribe regulations to carry out the purposes of this section.</p>
<h4 class="paragraph-head">(2) Domestic funds transfers</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">Whenever the Secretary and the Board of Governors of the Federal Reserve System (hereafter in this section referred to as the &quot;Board&quot;) determine that the maintenance of records, by insured depository institutions, of payment orders which direct transfers of funds over wholesale funds transfer systems has a high degree of usefulness in criminal, tax, or regulatory investigations or proceedings, the Secretary and the Board shall jointly prescribe regulations to carry out the purposes of this section with respect to the maintenance of such records.</p>
<h4 class="paragraph-head">(3) International funds transfers</h4>
<h4 class="subparagraph-head">(A) In general</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">The Secretary and the Board shall jointly prescribe, after consultation with State banking supervisors, final regulations requiring that insured depository institutions, businesses that provide check cashing services, money transmitting businesses, and businesses that issue or redeem money orders, travelers&apos; checks or other similar instruments maintain such records of payment orders which&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-3em">(i) involve international transactions; and</p>
<p class="statutory-body-3em">(ii) direct transfers of funds over wholesale funds transfer systems or on the books of any insured depository institution, or on the books of any business that provides check cashing services, any money transmitting business, and any business that issues or redeems money orders, travelers&apos; checks or similar instruments,</p>
<br class="Q04" />
<p class="statutory-body-block-2em" style="padding-left:2em text-indent:0em">that will have a high degree of usefulness in criminal, tax, or regulatory investigations or proceedings.</p>
<h4 class="subparagraph-head">(B) Factors for consideration</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">In prescribing the regulations required under subparagraph (A), the Secretary and the Board shall consider&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-3em">(i) the usefulness in criminal, tax, or regulatory investigations or proceedings of any record required to be maintained pursuant to the proposed regulations; and</p>
<p class="statutory-body-3em">(ii) the effect the recordkeeping required pursuant to such proposed regulations will have on the cost and efficiency of the payment system.</p>
<h4 class="subparagraph-head">(C) Availability of records</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">Any records required to be maintained pursuant to the regulations prescribed under subparagraph (A) shall be submitted or made available to the Secretary or the Board upon request.</p>

<p class="statutory-body">Subject to the requirements of any regulations prescribed jointly by the Secretary and the Board under paragraph (2) or (3) of subsection (b), each insured depository institution shall maintain such records and other evidence, in such form as the Secretary shall require, of the identity of each person having an account in the United States with the insured depository institution and of each individual authorized to sign checks, make withdrawals, or otherwise act with respect to any such account. The Secretary may make such exemptions from any requirement otherwise imposed under this subsection as are consistent with the purposes of this section.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(d) Reproduction of checks, drafts, and other instruments; record of transactions; identity of party</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">Each insured depository institution shall make, to the extent that the regulations of the Secretary so require&mdash;</p>
<!-- PDFPage:1136 --><p class="statutory-body-1em">(1) a microfilm or other reproduction of each check, draft, or similar instrument drawn on it and presented to it for payment; and</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(2) a record of each check, draft, or similar instrument received by it for deposit or collection, together with an identification of the party for whose account it is to be deposited or collected, unless the insured depository institution has already made a record of the party's identity pursuant to subsection (c).</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(e) Identity of persons making reportable currency and foreign transactions</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">Subject to the requirements of any regulations prescribed jointly by the Secretary and the Board under paragraph (2) or (3) of subsection (b), whenever any individual engages (whether as principal, agent, or bailee) in any transaction with an insured depository institution which is required to be reported or recorded under subchapter II of chapter 53 of title 31, the insured depository institution shall require and retain such evidence of the identity of that individual as the Secretary may prescribe as appropriate under the circumstances.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(f) Additions to or substitutes for required records</h4>

<h4 class="subsection-head">(g) Retention period</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">Any type of record or evidence required under this section shall be retained for such period as the Secretary may prescribe for the type in question. Any period so prescribed shall not exceed six years unless the Secretary determines, having regard for the purposes of this section, that a longer period is necessary in the case of a particular type of record or evidence.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(h) Report to Congress by Secretary of the Treasury</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">The Secretary shall include in his annual report to the Congress information on his implementation of the authority conferred by this section and any similar authority with respect to recordkeeping or reporting requirements conferred by other provisions of law.</p>

<h4 class="subsection-head">(j) Civil penalties</h4>

<h4 class="paragraph-head">(2) Treatment of continuing violation</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">A separate violation of any regulation prescribed under subsection (b) of this section occurs for each day the violation continues and at each office, branch, or place of business at which such violation occurs.</p>

The Corporation shall actively market eligible single family properties for sale to low-income families and to low-income families with members who are veterans.</p>
<h4 class="paragraph-head">(3) Recapture of profits from resale</h4>

<h4 class="subparagraph-head">(B) Other recapture provisions</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">The requirement under paragraph (3) shall not apply to any eligible single family property for which, upon resale by the qualifying household or low-income family during the 1-year period beginning upon initial acquisition by the household or family, a portion of the sale proceeds or any subsidy provided in connection with the acquisition of the property by the household or family is required to be recaptured or repaid under any other Federal, State, or local law (including section 143(m) of title 26) or regulation or under any sale agreement.</p>
<h4 class="paragraph-head">(5) Exception to avoid displacement of existing residents</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">Notwithstanding the first sentence of paragraph (2), during the 180-day period following the date on which the Corporation makes an eligible single family property available for sale, the Corporation may sell the property to the household residing in the property, but only if (A) such household was residing in the property at the time notice regarding the property was provided to clearinghouses under <!-- PDFPage:1176 -->paragraph (1), (B) such sale is necessary to avoid the displacement of, and unnecessary hardship to, the resident household, (C) the resident household intends to occupy the property as a principal residence for at least 12 months, and (D) the resident household certifies in writing that the household intends to occupy the property for at least 12 months.</p>

<h4 class="paragraph-head">(4) Offers by qualifying multifamily purchasers</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">A qualifying multifamily purchaser receiving notice in accordance with paragraph (3) shall have 45 days (from the date notice is received) to make a bona fide offer to purchase the property. The Corporation shall accept an offer that complies with the terms and conditions established by the Corporation. If, before the expiration of such 45-day period, any offer to purchase a property initially accepted by the Corporation is subsequently rejected or fails (for any reason), the Corporation shall accept another offer to purchase the property made during such period that complies with the terms and conditions established by the Corporation (if such another offer is made). The preceding sentence may not be construed to require a qualifying multifamily purchaser whose offer is accepted during the 45-day period to purchase the property before the expiration of the period.</p>

<p class="statutory-body-3em">(i) applies equally to all out-of-State banks; and</p>

<h4 class="subparagraph-head">(A) In general</h4>

<h4 class="subparagraph-head">(B) Treatment of branch for purposes of this section</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">In the case of an interstate merger transaction which involves the acquisition of a branch of an insured bank without the acquisition of the bank, the branch shall be treated, for purposes of this section, as an insured bank the home State of which is the State in which the branch is located.</p>

<p class="statutory-body-1em">(2) an agreement by the consumer not to obtain, or a prohibition on the consumer from obtaining, an insurance product from an unaffiliated entity.</p>

<h4 class="subparagraph-head">(E) Adjustments for alternative methods of purchase</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">In prescribing the requirements under subparagraphs (A) and (F), necessary adjustments shall be made for purchase in person, by telephone, or by electronic media to provide for the most appropriate and complete form of disclosure and acknowledgments.</p>

<p class="statutory-body-2em">Standards that permit any person accepting deposits from the public in an area where such transactions are routinely conducted in a depository institution to refer a customer who seeks to purchase any insurance product to a qualified person who sells such product, only if the person making the referral receives no more than a one-time nominal fee of a fixed dollar amount for each referral that does not depend on whether the referral results in a transaction.</p>
<h4 class="subparagraph-head">(C) Qualification and licensing requirements</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">Standards prohibiting any depository institution from permitting any person to sell or offer for sale any insurance product in any part of any office of the institution, or on behalf of the institution, unless such person is appropriately qualified and licensed.</p>

<h4 class="paragraph-head">(2) Scope of application</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">The prohibition contained in paragraph (1) shall apply to any life or health insurance product which is sold or offered for sale, as principal, agent, or broker, by any depository institution or any person who is engaged in such activities at an office of the institution or on behalf of the institution.</p>
<h4 class="paragraph-head">(3) Domestic violence defined</h4>

<h3 class="section-head">&sect;1835a. Prohibition against deposit production offices</h3>
<!-- field-end:head -->
<!-- field-start:statute -->
<h4 class="subsection-head">(a) Regulations</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">The appropriate Federal banking agencies shall prescribe uniform regulations effective June 1, 1997, which prohibit any out-of-State bank from using any authority to engage in interstate branching pursuant to this title,<sup><a href="#1835a_1_target" name="1835a_1">1</a></sup> or any amendment made by this title&#160;<sup><a href="#1835a_1_target" name="1835a_1">1</a></sup> to any other provision of law, primarily for the purpose of deposit production.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(b) Guidelines for meeting credit needs</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">Regulations issued under subsection (a) shall include guidelines to ensure that interstate <!-- PDFPage:1215 -->branches operated by an out-of-State bank in a host State are reasonably helping to meet the credit needs of the communities which the branches serve.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(c) Limitation on out-of-State loans</h4>
<h4 class="paragraph-head">(1) Limitation</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">Regulations issued under subsection (a) shall require that, beginning no earlier than 1 year after establishment or acquisition of an interstate branch or branches in a host State by an out-of-State bank, if the appropriate Federal banking agency for the out-of-State bank determines that the bank's level of lending in the host State relative to the deposits from the host State (as reasonably determinable from available information including the agency's sampling of the bank's loan files during an examination or such data as is otherwise available) is less than half the average of total loans in the host State relative to total deposits from the host State (as determinable from relevant sources) for all banks the home State of which is such State&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(A) the appropriate Federal banking agency for the out-of-State bank shall review the loan portfolio of the bank and determine whether the bank is reasonably helping to meet the credit needs of the communities served by the bank in the host State; and</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(B) if the agency determines that the out-of-State bank is not reasonably helping to meet those needs&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-3em">(i) the agency may order that an interstate branch or branches of such bank in the host State be closed unless the bank provides reasonable assurances to the satisfaction of the appropriate Federal banking agency that the bank has an acceptable plan that will reasonably help to meet the credit needs of the communities served by the bank in the host State, and</p>
<p class="statutory-body-3em">(ii) the out-of-State bank may not open a new interstate branch in the host State unless the bank provides reasonable assurances to the satisfaction of the appropriate Federal banking agency that the bank will reasonably help to meet the credit needs of the community that the new branch will serve.</p>
<h4 class="paragraph-head">(2) Considerations</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">In making a determination under paragraph (1)(A), the appropriate Federal banking agency shall consider&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(A) whether the interstate branch or branches of the out-of-State bank were formerly part of a failed or failing depository institution;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(B) whether the interstate branch was acquired under circumstances where there was a low loan-to-deposit ratio because of the nature of the acquired institution's business or loan portfolio;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(C) whether the interstate branch or branches of the out-of-State bank have a higher concentration of commercial or credit card lending, trust services, or other specialized activities;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(D) the ratings received by the out-of-State bank under the Community Reinvestment Act of 1977 [12 U.S.C. 2901 et seq.];</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(E) economic conditions, including the level of loan demand, within the communities served by the interstate branch or branches of the out-of-State bank; and</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(F) the safe and sound operation and condition of the out-of-State bank.</p>
<h4 class="paragraph-head">(3) Branch closing procedure</h4>
<h4 class="subparagraph-head">(A) Notice required</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">Before exercising any authority under paragraph (1)(B)(i), the appropriate Federal banking agency shall issue to the bank a notice of the agency's intention to close an interstate branch or branches and shall schedule a hearing.</p>
<h4 class="subparagraph-head">(B) Hearing</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">Section 1818(h) of this title shall apply to any proceeding brought under this paragraph.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(d) Application</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">This section shall apply with respect to any interstate branch established or acquired in a host State pursuant to this title&#160;<sup><a href="#1835a_1_target" name="1835a_1">1</a></sup> or any amendment made by this title&#160;<sup><a href="#1835a_1_target" name="1835a_1">1</a></sup> to any other provision of law.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(e) Definitions</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">For the purposes of this section, the following definitions shall apply:</p>
<h4 class="paragraph-head">(1) Appropriate Federal banking agency, bank, State, and State bank</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">The terms &quot;appropriate Federal banking agency&quot;, &quot;bank&quot;, &quot;State&quot;, and &quot;State bank&quot; have the same meanings as in section 1813 of this title.</p>
