<h4 class="paragraph-head">(2) Involuntary termination</h4>
<h4 class="subparagraph-head">(A) Notice to primary regulator</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">If the Board of Directors determines that&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-3em">(i) an insured depository institution or the directors or trustees of an insured depository institution have engaged or are engaging in unsafe or unsound practices in conducting the business of the depository institution;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-3em">(ii) an insured depository institution is in an unsafe or unsound condition to continue operations as an insured institution; or</p>
<p class="statutory-body-3em">(iii) an insured depository institution or the directors or trustees of the insured institution have violated any applicable law, regulation, order, condition imposed in writing by the Corporation in connection with the approval of any application or other request by the insured depository institution, or written agreement entered into between the insured depository institution and the Corporation,</p>
<br class="Q04" />
<p class="statutory-body-block-2em" style="padding-left:2em text-indent:0em">the Board of Directors shall notify the appropriate Federal banking agency with respect to such institution (if other than the Corporation) or the State banking supervisor of such institution (if the Corporation is the appropriate Federal banking agency) of the Board's determination and the facts and circumstances on which such determination is based for the purpose of securing the correction of such practice, condition, or violation. Such notice shall be given to the appropriate Federal banking agency not less than 30 days before the notice required by subparagraph (B), except that this period for notice to the appropriate Federal banking agency may be reduced or eliminated with the agreement of such agency.</p>
<h4 class="subparagraph-head">(B) Notice of intention to terminate insurance</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">If, after giving the notice required under subparagraph (A) with respect to an insured depository institution, the Board of Directors determines that any unsafe or unsound practice or condition or any violation specified in such notice requires the termination of the insured status of the insured depository institution, the Board shall&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-3em">(i) serve written notice to the insured depository institution of the Board's intention to terminate the insured status of the institution;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-3em">(ii) provide the insured depository institution with a statement of the charges on the basis of which the determination to terminate such institution's insured status was made (or a copy of the notice under subparagraph (A)); and</p>
<p class="statutory-body-3em">(iii) notify the insured depository institution of the date (not less than 30 days after notice under this subparagraph) and place for a hearing before the Board of Directors (or any person designated by the Board) with respect to the termination of the institution's insured status.</p>
<h4 class="paragraph-head">(3) Hearing; termination</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">If, on the basis of the evidence presented at a hearing before the Board of Directors (or any person designated by the Board for such purpose), in which all issues shall be determined on the record pursuant to section 554 of title 5 and the written findings of the Board of Directors (or such person) with respect to such evidence (which shall be conclusive), the Board of Directors finds that any unsafe or unsound practice or condition or any violation specified in the notice to an insured depository institution under paragraph (2)(B) or subsection (w) has been established, the Board of Directors may issue an order terminating the insured status of such depository institution effective as of a date subsequent to such finding.</p>
<h4 class="paragraph-head">(4) Appearance; consent to termination</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">Unless the depository institution shall appear at the hearing by a duly authorized representative, it shall be deemed to have consented to the termination of its status as an insured depository institution and termination of such status thereupon may be ordered.</p>
<h4 class="paragraph-head">(5) Judicial review</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">Any insured depository institution whose insured status has been terminated by order of the Board of Directors under this subsection shall have the right of judicial review of such order only to the same extent as provided for the review of orders under subsection (h) of this section.</p>
<h4 class="paragraph-head">(6) Publication of notice of termination</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">The Corporation may publish notice of such termination and the depository institution shall give notice of such termination to each of its depositors at his last address of record on the books of the depository institution, in such manner and at such time as the Board of Directors may find to be necessary and may order for the protection of depositors.</p>
<h4 class="paragraph-head">(7) Temporary insurance of deposits insured as of termination</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">After the termination of the insured status of any depository institution under the provisions of this subsection, the insured deposits of each depositor in the depository institution on the date of such termination, less all subsequent withdrawals from any deposits of such depositor, shall continue for a period of at least 6 months or up to 2 years, within the discretion of the Board of Directors, to be in<!-- PDFPage:1008 -->sured, and the depository institution shall continue to pay to the Corporation assessments as in the case of an insured depository institution during such period. No additions to any such deposits and no new deposits in such depository institution made after the date of such termination shall be insured by the Corporation, and the depository institution shall not advertise or hold itself out as having insured deposits unless in the same connection it shall also state with equal prominence that such additions to deposits and new deposits made after such date are not so insured. Such depository institution shall, in all other respects, be subject to the duties and obligations of an insured depository institution for the period referred to in the 1st sentence from the date of such termination, and in the event that such depository institution shall be closed on account of inability to meet the demands of its depositors within such period, the Corporation shall have the same powers and rights with respect to such depository institution as in case of an insured depository institution.</p>
<h4 class="paragraph-head">(8) Temporary suspension of insurance</h4>
<h4 class="subparagraph-head">(A) In general</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">If the Board of Directors initiates a termination proceeding under paragraph (2), and the Board of Directors, after consultation with the appropriate Federal banking agency, finds that an insured depository institution (other than a savings association to which subparagraph (B) applies) has no tangible capital under the capital guidelines or regulations of the appropriate Federal banking agency, the Corporation may issue a temporary order suspending deposit insurance on all deposits received by the institution.</p>
<h4 class="subparagraph-head">(B) Special rule for certain savings institutions</h4>
<h4 class="clause-head">(i) Certain goodwill included in tangible capital</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-3em">In determining the tangible capital of a savings association for purposes of this paragraph, the Board of Directors shall include goodwill to the extent it is considered a component of capital under section 1464(t) of this title. Any savings association which would be subject to a suspension order under subparagraph (A) but for the operation of this subparagraph, shall be considered by the Corporation to be a &quot;special supervisory association&quot;.</p>
<h4 class="clause-head">(ii) Suspension order</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-3em">The Corporation may issue a temporary order suspending deposit insurance on all deposits received by a special supervisory association whenever the Board of Directors determines that&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-4em">(I) the capital of such association, as computed utilizing applicable accounting standards, has suffered a material decline;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-4em">(II) that such association (or its directors or officers) is engaging in an unsafe or unsound practice in conducting the business of the association;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-4em">(III) that such association is in an unsafe or unsound condition to continue operating as an insured association; or</p>
<p class="statutory-body-4em">(IV) that such association (or its directors or officers) has violated any applicable law, rule, regulation, or order, or any condition imposed in writing by a Federal banking agency, or any written agreement including a capital improvement plan entered into with any Federal banking agency, or that the association has failed to enter into a capital improvement plan which is acceptable to the Corporation within the time period set forth in section 1464(t) of this title.</p>
<br class="Q04" />
<p class="statutory-body-flush2_hang3">&#160;Nothing in this paragraph limits the right of the Corporation or the Comptroller of the Currency to enforce a contractual provision which authorizes the Corporation or the Comptroller of the Currency, as a successor to the Federal Savings and Loan Insurance Corporation or the Federal Home Loan Bank Board, to require a savings association to write down or amortize goodwill at a faster rate than otherwise required under this chapter or under applicable accounting standards.</p>
<h4 class="subparagraph-head">(C) Effective period of temporary order</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">Any order issued under subparagraph (A) shall become effective not earlier than 10 days from the date of service upon the institution and, unless set aside, limited, or suspended by a court in proceedings authorized hereunder, such temporary order shall remain effective and enforceable until an order of the Board under paragraph (3) becomes final or until the Corporation dismisses the proceedings under paragraph (3).</p>
<h4 class="subparagraph-head">(D) Judicial review</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">Before the close of the 10-day period beginning on the date any temporary order has been served upon an insured depository institution under subparagraph (A), such institution may apply to the United States District Court for the District of Columbia, or the United States district court for the judicial district in which the home office of the institution is located, for an injunction setting aside, limiting, or suspending the enforcement, operation, or effectiveness of such order, and such court shall have jurisdiction to issue such injunction.</p>
<h4 class="subparagraph-head">(E) Continuation of insurance for prior deposits</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">The insured deposits of each depositor in such depository institution on the effective date of the order issued under this paragraph, minus all subsequent withdrawals from any deposits of such depositor, shall continue to be insured, subject to the administrative proceedings as provided in this chapter.</p>
<h4 class="subparagraph-head">(F) Publication of order</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">The depository institution shall give notice of such order to each of its depositors in such manner and at such times as the Board of Directors may find to be necessary and may order for the protection of depositors.</p>
<!-- PDFPage:1009 --><h4 class="subparagraph-head">(G) Notice by Corporation</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">If the Corporation determines that the depository institution has not substantially complied with the notice to depositors required by the Board of Directors, the Corporation may provide such notice in such manner as the Board of Directors may find to be necessary and appropriate.</p>
<h4 class="subparagraph-head">(H) Lack of notice</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">Notwithstanding subparagraph (A), any deposit made after the effective date of a suspension order issued under this paragraph shall remain insured to the extent that the depositor establishes that&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-3em">(i) such deposit consists of additions made by automatic deposit the depositor was unable to prevent; or</p>
<p class="statutory-body-3em">(ii) such depositor did not have actual knowledge of the suspension of insurance.</p>
<h4 class="paragraph-head">(9) Final decisions to terminate insurance</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">Any decision by the Board of Directors to&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(A) issue a temporary order terminating deposit insurance; or</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(B) issue a final order terminating deposit insurance (other than under subsection (p) or (q));</p>
<br class="Q04" />
<p class="statutory-body-block-1em">shall be made by the Board of Directors and may not be delegated.</p>
<h4 class="paragraph-head">(10) Low- to moderate-income housing lender</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">In making any determination regarding the termination of insurance of a solvent savings association, the Corporation may consider the extent of the association's low- to moderate-income housing loans.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(b) Cease-and-desist proceedings</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">(1) If, in the opinion of the appropriate Federal banking agency, any insured depository institution, depository institution which has insured deposits, or any institution-affiliated party is engaging or has engaged, or the agency has reasonable cause to believe that the depository institution or any institution-affiliated party is about to engage, in an unsafe or unsound practice in conducting the business of such depository institution, or is violating or has violated, or the agency has reasonable cause to believe that the depository institution or any institution-affiliated party is about to violate, a law, rule, or regulation, or any condition imposed in writing by a Federal banking agency in connection with any action on any application, notice, or other request by the depository institution or institution-affiliated party, or any written agreement entered into with the agency, the appropriate Federal banking agency for the depository institution may issue and serve upon the depository institution or such party a notice of charges in respect thereof. The notice shall contain a statement of the facts constituting the alleged violation or violations or the unsafe or unsound practice or practices, and shall fix a time and place at which a hearing will be held to determine whether an order to cease and desist therefrom should issue against the depository institution or the institution-affiliated party. Such hearing shall be fixed for a date not earlier than thirty days nor later than sixty days after service of such notice unless an earlier or a later date is set by the agency at the request of any party so served. Unless the party or parties so served shall appear at the hearing personally or by a duly authorized representative, they shall be deemed to have consented to the issuance of the cease-and-desist order. In the event of such consent, or if upon the record made at any such hearing, the agency shall find that any violation or unsafe or unsound practice specified in the notice of charges has been established, the agency may issue and serve upon the depository institution or the institution-affiliated party an order to cease and desist from any such violation or practice. Such order may, by provisions which may be mandatory or otherwise, require the depository institution or its institution-affiliated parties to cease and desist from the same, and, further, to take affirmative action to correct the conditions resulting from any such violation or practice.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(2) A cease-and-desist order shall become effective at the expiration of thirty days after the service of such order upon the depository institution or other person concerned (except in the case of a cease-and-desist order issued upon consent, which shall become effective at the time specified therein), and shall remain effective and enforceable as provided therein, except to such extent as it is stayed, modified, terminated, or set aside by action of the agency or a reviewing court.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(3) This subsection, subsections (c) through (s) and subsection (u) of this section, and section 1831aa of this title shall apply to any bank holding company, and to any subsidiary (other than a bank) of a bank holding company, as those terms are defined in the Bank Holding Company Act of 1956 [12 U.S.C. 1841 et seq.], any savings and loan holding company and any subsidiary (other than a depository institution) of a savings and loan holding company (as such terms are defined in section 1467a of this title)),<sup><a href="#1818_2_target" name="1818_2">2</a></sup> any noninsured State member bank and to any organization organized and operated under section 25(a)&#160;<sup><a href="#1818_1_target" name="1818_1">1</a></sup> of the Federal Reserve Act [12 U.S.C. 611 et seq.] or operating under section 25 of the Federal Reserve Act [12 U.S.C. 601 et seq.], in the same manner as they apply to a State member insured bank. Nothing in this subsection or in subsection (c) of this section shall authorize any Federal banking agency, other than the Board of Governors of the Federal Reserve System, to issue a notice of charges or cease-and-desist order against a bank holding company or any subsidiary thereof (other than a bank or subsidiary of that bank) or against a savings and loan holding company or any subsidiary thereof (other than a depository institution or a subsidiary of such depository institution).</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(4) This subsection, subsections (c) through (s) and subsection (u) of this section, and section 1831aa of this title shall apply to any foreign bank or company to which subsection (a) of section 3106 of this title applies and to any subsidiary (other than a bank) of any such foreign bank or company in the same manner as they apply to a bank holding company and any subsidiary thereof (other than a bank) under para<!-- PDFPage:1010 -->graph (3) of this subsection. For the purposes of this paragraph, the term &quot;subsidiary&quot; shall have the meaning assigned to it in section 2 of the Bank Holding Company Act of 1956 [12 U.S.C. 1841].</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(5) This section shall apply, in the same manner as it applies to any insured depository institution for which the appropriate Federal banking agency is the Comptroller of the Currency, to any national banking association chartered by the Comptroller of the Currency, including an uninsured association.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(6) <cap-smallcap>Affirmative action to correct conditions resulting from violations or practices</cap-smallcap>.&mdash;The authority to issue an order under this subsection and subsection (c) which requires an insured depository institution or any institution-affiliated party to take affirmative action to correct or remedy any conditions resulting from any violation or practice with respect to which such order is issued includes the authority to require such depository institution or such party to&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(A) make restitution or provide reimbursement, indemnification, or guarantee against loss if&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(i) such depository institution or such party was unjustly enriched in connection with such violation or practice; or</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(ii) the violation or practice involved a reckless disregard for the law or any applicable regulations or prior order of the appropriate Federal banking agency;</p>

<p class="statutory-body-1em">(B) restrict the growth of the institution;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(C) dispose of any loan or asset involved;</p>

<p class="statutory-body-1em">(F) take such other action as the banking agency determines to be appropriate.</p>
<br class="Q04" />
<p class="statutory-body">(7) <cap-smallcap>Authority to limit activities</cap-smallcap>.&mdash;The authority to issue an order under this subsection or subsection (c) includes the authority to place limitations on the activities or functions of an insured depository institution or any institution-affiliated party.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(8) <cap-smallcap>Unsatisfactory asset quality, management, earnings, or liquidity as unsafe or unsound practice</cap-smallcap>.&mdash;If an insured depository institution receives, in its most recent report of examination, a less-than-satisfactory rating for asset quality, management, earnings, or liquidity, the appropriate Federal banking agency may (if the deficiency is not corrected) deem the institution to be engaging in an unsafe or unsound practice for purposes of this subsection.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(9) [Repealed]</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(10) <cap-smallcap>Standard for certain orders</cap-smallcap>.&mdash;No authority under this subsection or subsection (c) to prohibit any institution-affiliated party from withdrawing, transferring, removing, dissipating, or disposing of any funds, assets, or other property may be exercised unless the appropriate Federal banking agency meets the standards of Rule 65 of the Federal Rules of Civil Procedure, without regard to the requirement of such rule that the applicant show that the injury, loss, or damage is irreparable and immediate.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(c) Temporary cease-and-desist orders</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">(1) Whenever the appropriate Federal banking agency shall determine that the violation or threatened violation or the unsafe or unsound practice or practices, specified in the notice of charges served upon the depository institution or any institution-affiliated party pursuant to paragraph (1) of subsection (b) of this section, or the continuation thereof, is likely to cause insolvency or significant dissipation of assets or earnings of the depository institution, or is likely to weaken the condition of the depository institution or otherwise prejudice the interests of its depositors prior to the completion of the proceedings conducted pursuant to paragraph (1) of subsection (b) of this section, the agency may issue a temporary order requiring the depository institution or such party to cease and desist from any such violation or practice and to take affirmative action to prevent or remedy such insolvency, dissipation, condition, or prejudice pending completion of such proceedings. Such order may include any requirement authorized under subsection (b)(6). Such order shall become effective upon service upon the depository institution or such institution-affiliated party and, unless set aside, limited, or suspended by a court in proceedings authorized by paragraph (2) of this subsection, shall remain effective and enforceable pending the completion of the administrative proceedings pursuant to such notice and until such time as the agency shall dismiss the charges specified in such notice, or if a cease-and-desist order is issued against the depository institution or such party, until the effective date of such order.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(2) Within ten days after the depository institution concerned or any institution-affiliated party has been served with a temporary cease-and-desist order, the depository institution or such party may apply to the United States district court for the judicial district in which the home office of the depository institution is located, or the United States District Court for the District of Columbia, for an injunction setting aside, limiting, or suspending the enforcement, operation, or effectiveness of such order pending the completion of the administrative proceedings pursuant to the notice of charges served upon the depository institution or such party under paragraph (1) of subsection (b) of this section, and such court shall have jurisdiction to issue such injunction.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(3) <cap-smallcap>Incomplete or inaccurate records.&mdash;</cap-smallcap></p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(A) <cap-smallcap>Temporary order</cap-smallcap>.&mdash;If a notice of charges served under subsection (b)(1) specifies, on the basis of particular facts and circumstances, that an insured depository institution's books and records are so incomplete or inaccurate that the appropriate Federal banking agency is unable, through the normal supervisory process, to determine the financial condition of that depository institution or the details or purpose of any transaction or transactions that may have a material effect on the financial condition of that depository institution, the agency may issue a temporary order requiring&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(i) the cessation of any activity or practice which gave rise, whether in whole or in part, to the incomplete or inaccurate state of the books or records; or</p>
<!-- PDFPage:1011 --><p class="statutory-body-2em">(ii) affirmative action to restore such books or records to a complete and accurate state, until the completion of the proceedings under subsection (b)(1).</p>

<p class="statutory-body-3em">(I) the completion of the proceeding initiated under subsection (b)(1) in connection with the notice of charges; or</p>
<p class="statutory-body-3em">(II) the date the appropriate Federal banking agency determines, by examination or otherwise, that the insured depository institution's books and records are accurate and reflect the financial condition of the depository institution.</p>
<br class="Q04" />
<p class="statutory-body">(4) <cap-smallcap>False advertising or misuse of names to indicate insured status.&mdash;</cap-smallcap></p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(A) <cap-smallcap>Temporary order.&mdash;</cap-smallcap></p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(i) <cap-smallcap>In general</cap-smallcap>.&mdash;If a notice of charges served under subsection (b)(1) specifies on the basis of particular facts that any person engaged or is engaging in conduct described in section 1828(a)(4) of this title, the Corporation or other appropriate Federal banking agency may issue a temporary order requiring&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-3em">(I) the immediate cessation of any activity or practice described, which gave rise to the notice of charges; and</p>
<p class="statutory-body-3em">(II) affirmative action to prevent any further, or to remedy any existing, violation.</p>

<p class="statutory-body-2em">(ii) if a cease-and-desist order is issued against such person, until the effective date of such order.</p>
<br class="Q04" />
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(C) <cap-smallcap>Civil money penalties</cap-smallcap>.&mdash;Any violation of section 1828(a)(4) of this title shall be subject to civil money penalties, as set forth in subsection (i), except that for any person other than an insured depository institution or an institution-affiliated party that is found to have violated this paragraph, the Corporation or other appropriate Federal banking agency shall not be required to demonstrate any loss to an insured depository institution.</p>
