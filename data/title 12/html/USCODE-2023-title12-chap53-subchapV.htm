<br class="Q04" />
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(B) the Bureau shall consult with the appropriate prudential regulators or other Federal agencies prior to proposing a rule and during the comment process regarding consistency with prudential, market, or systemic objectives administered by such agencies; and</p>

<h4 class="subsection-head">(a) In general</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">The Bureau may take any action authorized under part E to prevent a covered person or service provider from committing or engaging in an unfair, deceptive, or abusive act or practice under Federal law in connection with any transaction with a consumer for a consumer financial product or service, or the offering of a consumer financial product or service.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(b) Rulemaking</h4>

<h4 class="subsection-head">(c) Unfairness</h4>
<h4 class="paragraph-head">(1) In general</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">The Bureau shall have no authority under this section to declare an act or practice in connection with a transaction with a consumer for a consumer financial product or service, or the offering of a consumer financial product or service, to be unlawful on the grounds that such act or practice is unfair, unless the Bureau has a reasonable basis to conclude that&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(A) the act or practice causes or is likely to cause substantial injury to consumers which is not reasonably avoidable by consumers; and</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(B) such substantial injury is not outweighed by countervailing benefits to consumers or to competition.</p>
<h4 class="paragraph-head">(2) Consideration of public policies</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">In determining whether an act or practice is unfair, the Bureau may consider established public policies as evidence to be considered with all other evidence. Such public policy considerations may not serve as a primary basis for such determination.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(d) Abusive</h4>

<p class="statutory-body-1em">(2) takes unreasonable advantage of&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(A) a lack of understanding on the part of the consumer of the material risks, costs, or conditions of the product or service;</p>

<p class="statutory-body-2em">The notice under subparagraph (A) shall contain a statement of the facts constituting the alleged violation or violations, and shall fix a time and place at which a hearing will be held to determine whether an order to cease and desist should issue against the covered person or service provider, such hearing to be held not earlier than 30 days nor later than 60 days after the date of service of such notice, unless an earlier or a later date is set by the Bureau, at the request of any party so served.</p>
<h4 class="subparagraph-head">(C) Consent</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">Unless the party or parties served under subparagraph (B) appear at the hearing personally or by a duly authorized representative, such person shall be deemed to have consented to the issuance of the cease-and-desist order.</p>
<h4 class="subparagraph-head">(D) Procedure</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">In the event of consent under subparagraph (C), or if, upon the record, made at any such hearing, the Bureau finds that any violation specified in the notice of charges has been established, the Bureau may issue and serve upon the covered person or service provider an order to cease and desist from the violation or practice. Such order may, by provisions which may be mandatory or otherwise, require the covered person or service provider to cease and desist from the subject activity, and to take affirmative action to correct the conditions resulting from any such violation.</p>
<h4 class="paragraph-head">(2) Effectiveness of order</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">A cease-and-desist order shall become effective at the expiration of 30 days after the date of service of an order under paragraph (1) upon the covered person or service provider concerned (except in the case of a cease-and-desist order issued upon consent, which shall become effective at the time specified therein), and shall remain effective and enforceable as provided therein, except to such extent as the order is stayed, modified, terminated, or set aside by action of the Bureau or a reviewing court.</p>
<h4 class="paragraph-head">(3) Decision and appeal</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">Any hearing provided for in this subsection shall be held in the Federal judicial district or in the territory in which the residence or principal office or place of business of the person is located unless the person consents to another place, and shall be conducted in accordance with the provisions of chapter 5 of title 5. After such hearing, and within 90 days after the Bureau has notified the parties that the case has been submitted to the Bureau for final decision, the Bureau shall render its decision (which shall include findings of fact upon which its decision is predicated) and shall issue and serve upon each party to the proceeding an order or orders consistent with the provisions of this section. Judicial review of any such order shall be exclusively as provided in this subsection. Unless a petition for review is timely filed in a court of appeals of the United States, as provided in paragraph (4), and thereafter until the record in the proceeding has been filed as provided in paragraph (4), the Bureau may at any time, upon such notice and in such manner as the Bureau shall determine proper, modify, terminate, or set aside any such order. Upon filing of the record as provided, the Bureau may modify, terminate, or set aside any such order with permission of the court.</p>
<h4 class="paragraph-head">(4) Appeal to court of appeals</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">Any party to any proceeding under this subsection may obtain a review of any order served pursuant to this subsection (other than an order issued with the consent of the person concerned) by the filing in the court of appeals of the United States for the circuit in which the principal office of the covered person is located, or in the United States Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia Circuit, within 30 days after the date of service of such order, a written petition praying that the order of the Bureau be modified, terminated, or set aside. A copy of such petition shall be forthwith transmitted by the clerk of the court to the Bureau, and thereupon the Bureau shall file in the court the record in the proceeding, as provided in section 2112 of title 28. Upon the filing of such petition, such court shall have jurisdiction, which upon the filing of the record shall except as provided in the last sentence of paragraph (3) be exclusive, to affirm, modify, terminate, or set aside, in whole or in part, the order of the Bureau. Review of such proceedings shall be had as provided in chapter 7 of title 5. The judgment and decree of the court shall be final, except that the same shall be subject to review by the Supreme Court of the United States, upon certiorari, as provided in section 1254 of title 28.</p>
<h4 class="paragraph-head">(5) No stay</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">The commencement of proceedings for judicial review under paragraph (4) shall not, unless specifically ordered by the court, operate as a stay of any order issued by the Bureau.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(c) Special rules for temporary cease-and-desist proceedings</h4>
<h4 class="paragraph-head">(1) In general</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">Whenever the Bureau determines that the violation specified in the notice of charges served upon a person, including a service provider, pursuant to subsection (b), or the continuation thereof, is likely to cause the person to be insolvent or otherwise prejudice the interests of consumers before the completion of the proceedings conducted pursuant to subsection (b), the Bureau may issue a temporary order requiring the person to cease and desist from any such violation or practice and to take affirmative action to prevent or remedy such insolvency or other condition pending completion of such proceedings. Such order <!-- PDFPage:1987 -->may include any requirement authorized under this part. Such order shall become effective upon service upon the person and, unless set aside, limited, or suspended by a court in proceedings authorized by paragraph (2), shall remain effective and enforceable pending the completion of the administrative proceedings pursuant to such notice and until such time as the Bureau shall dismiss the charges specified in such notice, or if a cease-and-desist order is issued against the person, until the effective date of such order.</p>
<h4 class="paragraph-head">(2) Appeal</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">Not later than 10 days after the covered person or service provider concerned has been served with a temporary cease-and-desist order, the person may apply to the United States district court for the judicial district in which the residence or principal office or place of business of the person is located, or the United States District Court for the District of Columbia, for an injunction setting aside, limiting, or suspending the enforcement, operation, or effectiveness of such order pending the completion of the administrative proceedings pursuant to the notice of charges served upon the person under subsection (b), and such court shall have jurisdiction to issue such injunction.</p>
<h4 class="paragraph-head">(3) Incomplete or inaccurate records</h4>
<h4 class="subparagraph-head">(A) Temporary order</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">If a notice of charges served under subsection (b) specifies, on the basis of particular facts and circumstances, that the books and records of a covered person or service provider are so incomplete or inaccurate that the Bureau is unable to determine the financial condition of that person or the details or purpose of any transaction or transactions that may have a material effect on the financial condition of that person, the Bureau may issue a temporary order requiring&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-3em">(i) the cessation of any activity or practice which gave rise, whether in whole or in part, to the incomplete or inaccurate state of the books or records; or</p>
<p class="statutory-body-3em">(ii) affirmative action to restore such books or records to a complete and accurate state, until the completion of the proceedings under subsection (b)(1).</p>
<h4 class="subparagraph-head">(B) Effective period</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">Any temporary order issued under subparagraph (A)&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-3em">(i) shall become effective upon service; and</p>
<p class="statutory-body-3em">(ii) unless set aside, limited, or suspended by a court in proceedings under paragraph (2), shall remain in effect and enforceable until the earlier of&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-4em">(I) the completion of the proceeding initiated under subsection (b) in connection with the notice of charges; or</p>
<p class="statutory-body-4em">(II) the date the Bureau determines, by examination or otherwise, that the books and records of the covered person or service provider are accurate and reflect the financial condition thereof.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(d) Special rules for enforcement of orders</h4>
<h4 class="paragraph-head">(1) In general</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">The Bureau may in its discretion apply to the United States district court within the jurisdiction of which the principal office or place of business of the person is located, for the enforcement of any effective and outstanding notice or order issued under this section, and such court shall have jurisdiction and power to order and require compliance herewith.</p>
<h4 class="paragraph-head">(2) Exception</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">Except as otherwise provided in this subsection, no court shall have jurisdiction to affect by injunction or otherwise the issuance or enforcement of any notice or order or to review, modify, suspend, terminate, or set aside any such notice or order.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(e) Rules</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">The Bureau shall prescribe rules establishing such procedures as may be necessary to carry out this section.</p>

L. 111&ndash;203, which is classified to section 5532(f) of this title, contains substantially similar provisions to the section 4302(d) that was probably referred to.</p>
