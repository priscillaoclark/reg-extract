<h4 class="subsection-head">(a) Authorization for periodic interest reduction payments on behalf of owner of rental housing project</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">For the purpose of reducing rentals for lower income families, the Secretary is authorized to make, and to contract to make, periodic interest reduction payments on behalf of the owner of a rental housing project designed for occupancy by lower income families, which shall be accomplished through payments to morgagees&#160;<sup><a href="#1715z-1_1_target" name="1715z-1_1">1</a></sup> holding mortgages meeting the special requirements specified in this section.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(b) Restrictions on payments; payments with respect to projects financed under State or local programs; mortgage insurance premium</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">Interest reduction payments with respect to a project shall only be made during such time as the project is operated as a rental housing project and is subject to a mortgage which meets the requirements of, and is insured under, subsection (j) of this section: <i>Provided</i>, That the Secretary is authorized to continue making such interest reduction payments where the mortgage has been assigned to the Secretary: <i>Provided further</i>, That interest reduction payments may be made with respect to a mortgage or part thereof on a rental or cooperative housing project owned by a private nonprofit corporation or other private nonprofit entity, a limited dividend corporation or other limited dividend entity, public&#160;<sup><a href="#1715z-1_2_target" name="1715z-1_2">2</a></sup> entity, or a cooperative housing corporation, which is financed under a State or local program providing assistance through loans, loan insurance, or tax abatements, and which may involve either new or existing construction and which is approved for receiving the benefits of this section. The term &quot;mortgage insurance premium&quot;, when used in this section in relation to a project financed by a loan under a State or local program, means such fees and charges, approved by the Secretary, as are payable by the mortgagor to the State or local agency mortgagee to meet reserve requirements and administrative expenses of such agency.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(c) Amount of payments</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">The interest reduction payments to a mortgagee by the Secretary on behalf of a project owner shall be in an amount not exceeding the difference between the monthly payment for principal, interest, and mortgage insurance premium which the project owner as a mortgagor is obligated to pay under the mortgage and the monthly payment for principal and interest such project owner would be obligated to pay if the mortgage were to bear interest at the rate of 1 per centum per annum.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(d) Mortgage handling expenses</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">The Secretary may include in the payment to the mortgagee such amount, in addition to the amount computed under subsection (c), as he deems appropriate to reimburse the mortgagee for its expenses in handling the mortgage.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(e) Operation of project in accordance with requirements respecting tenant eligibility and rents prescribed by Secretary</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">(1) As a condition for receiving the benefits of interest reduction payments, the project owner shall operate the project in accordance with such requirements with respect to tenant eligibility and rents as the Secretary may prescribe. Procedures shall be adopted by the Secretary for review of tenant incomes at intervals of one year (or at shorter intervals where the Secretary deems it desirable).</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(2) A project for which interest reduction payments are made under this section and for which the mortgage on the project has been refinanced shall continue to receive the interest reduction payments under this section under the terms of the contract for such payments, but only if the project owner enters into such binding commitments as the Secretary may require (which shall be applicable to any subsequent owner) to ensure that the owner will continue to operate the project in accordance with all low-income affordability restrictions for the project in connection with the Federal assistance for the project for a period having a duration that is not less than the term for which such interest reduction payments are made plus an additional 5 years.</p>
<!-- PDFPage:668 --><h4 class="subsection-head">(f) Establishment of basic and fair market rental charges; rental for dwelling units; separate utility metering; additional assistance payments for low-income tenants; limitations; amounts; approval of payments</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">(1)(A)(i) For each dwelling unit there shall be established, with the approval of the Secretary, a basic rental charge and fair market rental charge.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(ii) The basic rental charge shall be&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(I) the amount needed to operate the project with payments of principal and interest due under a mortgage bearing interest at the rate of 1 percent per annum; or</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(II) an amount greater than that determined under clause (ii)(I), but not greater than the market rent for a comparable unassisted unit, reduced by the value of the interest reduction payments subsidy.</p>
<br class="Q04" />
<p class="statutory-body">(iii) The fair market rental charge shall be&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(I) the amount needed to operate the project with payments of principal, interest, and mortgage insurance premium which the mortgagor is obligated to pay under the mortgage covering the project; or</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(II) an amount greater than that determined under clause (iii)(I), but not greater than the market rent for a comparable unassisted unit.</p>
<br class="Q04" />
<p class="statutory-body">(iv) The Secretary may approve a basic rental charge and fair market rental charge for a unit that exceeds the minimum amounts permitted by this subparagraph for such charges only if&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(I) the approved basic rental charge and fair market rental charges each exceed the applicable minimum charge by the same amount; and</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(II) the project owner agrees to restrictions on project use or mortgage prepayment that are acceptable to the Secretary.</p>
<br class="Q04" />
<p class="statutory-body">(v) The Secretary may approve a basic rental charge and fair market rental charge under this paragraph for a unit with assistance under section 1437f of title 42 that differs from the basic rental charge and fair market rental charge for a unit in the same project that is similar in size and amenities but without such assistance, as needed to ensure equitable treatment of tenants in units without such assistance.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(B)(i) The rental charge for each dwelling unit shall be at the basic rental charge or such greater amount, not exceeding the fair market rental charge determined pursuant to subparagraph (A), as represents 30 percent of the tenant's adjusted income, except as otherwise provided in this subparagraph.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(ii) In the case of a project which contains more than 5000 units, is subject to an interest reduction payments contract, and is financed under a State or local project, the Secretary may reduce the rental charge ceiling, but in no case shall the rental charge be below the basic rental charge set forth in subparagraph (A)(ii)(I).</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(iii) For plans of action approved for capital grants under the Low-Income Housing Preservation and Resident Homeownership Act of 1990 [12 U.S.C. 4101 et seq.] or the Emergency Low Income Housing Preservation Act of 1987, the rental charge for each dwelling unit shall be at the minimum basic rental charge set forth in subparagraph (A)(ii)(I) or such greater amount, not exceeding the lower of: (I) the fair market rental charge set forth in subparagraph (A)(iii)(I); or (II) the actual rent paid for a comparable unit in comparable unassisted housing in the market area in which the housing assisted under this section is located, as represents 30 percent of the tenant's adjusted income.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(C) With respect to those projects which the Secretary determines have separate utility metering paid by the tenants for some or all dwelling units, the Secretary may&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(i) permit the basic rental charge and the fair market rental charge to be determined on the basis of operating the project without the payment of the cost of utility services used by such dwelling units; and</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(ii) permit the charging of a rental for such dwelling units at such an amount less than 30 percent of a tenant's adjusted income as the Secretary determines represents a proportionate decrease for the utility charges to be paid by such tenant, but in no case shall rental be lower than 25 percent of a tenant's adjusted income.</p>
<br class="Q04" />
<p class="statutory-body">(2) With respect to 20 per centum of the dwelling units in any project made subject to a contract under this section after August 22, 1974, the Secretary shall make, and contract to make, additional assistance payments to the project owner on behalf of tenants whose incomes are too low for them to afford the basic rentals (including the amount allowed for utilities in the case of a project with separate utility metering) with 30 per centum of their adjusted income. The additional assistance payments authorized by this paragraph with respect to any dwelling unit shall be the amount required to reduce the rental payment (including the amount allowed for utilities in the case of a project with separate utility metering) by the tenant to the highest of the following amounts, rounded to the nearest dollar:</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(A) 30 per centum of the tenant's monthly adjusted income;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(B) 10 per centum of the tenant's monthly income; or</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(C) if the family is receiving payments for welfare assistance from a public agency and a part of such payments, adjusted in accordance with the family's actual housing costs, is specifically designated by such agency to meet the family's housing costs, the portion of such payments which is so designated.</p>
<br class="Q04" />
<p class="statutory-body-block">Notwithstanding the foregoing provisions of this paragraph, the Secretary may&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(A) reduce such 20 per centum requirement in the case of any project if he determines that such action is necessary to assure the economic viability of the project; or</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(B) increase such 20 per centum requirement in the case of any project if he determines that such action is necessary and feasible in order to assure, insofar as is practicable, that there is in the project a reasonable range in the income levels of tenants, or that such action is to be taken to meet the housing needs of elderly or handicapped families.</p>
<br class="Q04" />
<p class="statutory-body">(3) The Secretary shall utilize amounts credited to the fund described in subsection (g) for <!-- PDFPage:669 -->the sole purpose of carrying out the purposes of section 201 of the Housing and Community Development Amendments of 1978. No payments may be made from such fund unless approved in an appropriation Act. No amount may be so approved for any fiscal year beginning after September 30, 1994.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(4) To ensure that eligible tenants occupying that number of units with respect to which assistance was being provided under this subsection immediately prior to November 30, 1983, receive the benefit of assistance contracted for under paragraph (2), the Secretary shall offer annually to amend contracts entered into under this subsection with owners of projects assisted but not subject to mortgages insured under this section to provide sufficient payments to cover 100 percent of the necessary rent increases and changes in the incomes of eligible tenants, subject to the availability of authority for such purpose under section 1437c(c) of title 42. The Secretary shall take such actions as may be necessary to ensure that payments, including payments that reflect necessary rent increases and changes in the incomes of tenants, are made on a timely basis for all units covered by contracts entered into under paragraph (2).</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(5)(A) In order to induce advances by owners for capital improvements (excluding any owner contributions that may be required by the Secretary as a condition for assistance under section 201 of the Housing and Community Development Amendments of 1978) to benefit projects assisted under this section, in establishing basic rental charges and fair market rental charges under paragraph (1) the Secretary may include an amount that would permit a return of such advances with interest to the owner out of project income, on such terms and conditions as the Secretary may determine. Any resulting increase in rent contributions shall be&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(i) to a level not exceeding the lower of 30 percent of the adjusted income of the tenant or the published existing fair market rent for comparable housing established under section 1437f(c) of title 42;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(ii) phased in equally over a period of not less than 3 years, if such increase is 30 percent or more; and</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(iii) limited to not more than 10 percent per year if such increase is more than 10 percent but less than 30 percent.</p>
<br class="Q04" />
<p class="statutory-body">(B) Assistance under section 1437f of title 42 shall be provided, to the extent available under appropriations Acts, if necessary to mitigate any adverse effects on income-eligible tenants.</p>

<p class="statutory-body">(7) The Secretary shall determine whether and under what conditions the provisions of this subsection shall apply to mortgages sold by the Secretary on a negotiated basis.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(g) Collection of excess rental charges; credit to reserve for additional assistance payments; retention by project owner</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">(1) The project owner shall, as required by the Secretary, accumulate, safeguard, and periodically pay the Secretary or such other entity as determined by the Secretary and upon such terms and conditions as the Secretary deems appropriate, all rental charges collected on a unit-by-unit basis in excess of the basic rental charges. Unless otherwise directed by the Secretary, such excess charges shall be credited to a reserve used by the Secretary to make additional assistance payments as provided in paragraph (3) of subsection (f).</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(2) Notwithstanding any other requirements of this subsection, a project owner may retain some or all of such excess charges for project use if authorized by the Secretary. Such excess charges shall be used for the project and upon terms and conditions established by the Secretary, unless the Secretary permits the owner to retain funds for non-project use after a determination that the project is well-maintained housing in good condition and that the owner has not engaged in material adverse financial or managerial actions or omissions as described in section 516 of the Multifamily Assisted Housing Reform and Affordability Act of 1997. In connection with the retention of funds for non-project use, the Secretary may require the project owner to enter into a binding commitment (which shall be applicable to any subsequent owner) to ensure that the owner will continue to operate the project in accordance with all low-income affordability restrictions for the project in connection with the Federal assistance for the project for a period having a duration of not less than the term of the existing affordability restrictions plus an additional 5 years.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(3) The Secretary shall not withhold approval of the retention by the owner of such excess charges because of the existence of unpaid excess charges if such unpaid amount is being remitted to the Secretary over a period of time in accordance with a workout agreement with the Secretary, unless the Secretary determines that the owner is in violation of the workout agreement.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(h) Rules and regulations</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">In addition to establishing the requirements specified in subsection (e), the Secretary is authorized to make such rules and regulations, to enter into such agreements, and to adopt such procedures as he may deem necessary or desirable to carry out the provisions of this section.</p>

<p class="statutory-body">(2) Contracts for assistance payments under this section may be entered into only with respect to tenants whose incomes do not exceed 80 per centum of the median family income for the area, as determined by the Secretary with adjustments for smaller and larger families, except that the Secretary may establish income ceilings higher or lower than 80 per centum of the median for the area on the basis of his findings that such variations are necessary because of prevailing levels of construction costs, unusually high or low family incomes, or other factors.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(3) Not less than 10 per centum of the total amount of contracts for assistance payments authorized by appropriation Acts to be made after June 30, 1974, shall be available for use only with respect to dwellings, or dwelling units in projects, which are approved by the Secretary prior to rehabilitation.</p>

<p class="statutory-body">(6) With the approval of the Secretary, the mortgagor may sell the individual dwelling units to lower income or elderly or handicapped purchasers. The Secretary may consent to the release of the mortgagor from his liability under the mortgage and the credit instrument secured thereby, or consent to the release of parts of the mortgaged property from the lien of the mortgage, upon such terms and conditions as he may prescribe, and the mortgage may provide for such release.</p>
