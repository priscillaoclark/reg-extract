<!-- field-end:head -->
<!-- field-start:statute -->
<p class="statutory-body">The Congress finds that&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(1) the Federal National Mortgage Association and the Federal Home Loan Mortgage Corporation (referred to in this section collectively as the &quot;enterprises&quot;), and the Federal Home Loan Banks (referred to in this section as the &quot;Banks&quot;), have important public missions that are reflected in the statutes and charter Acts establishing the Banks and the enterprises;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(2) because the continued ability of the Federal National Mortgage Association and the Federal Home Loan Mortgage Corporation to accomplish their public missions is important to providing housing in the United States and the health of the Nation's economy, more effective Federal regulation is needed to reduce the risk of failure of the enterprises;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(3) considering the current operating procedures of the Federal National Mortgage Association, the Federal Home Loan Mortgage Corporation, and the Federal Home Loan Banks, the enterprises and the Banks currently pose low financial risk of insolvency;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(4) neither the enterprises nor the Banks, nor any securities or obligations issued by the enterprises or the Banks, are backed by the full faith and credit of the United States;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(5) an entity regulating the Federal National Mortgage Association and the Federal Home Loan Mortgage Corporation should have sufficient autonomy from the enterprises and special interest groups;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(6) an entity regulating such enterprises should have the authority to establish capital standards, require financial disclosure, prescribe adequate standards for books and records and other internal controls, conduct examinations when necessary, and enforce compliance with the standards and rules that it establishes;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(7) the Federal National Mortgage Association and the Federal Home Loan Mortgage Corporation have an affirmative obligation to facilitate the financing of affordable housing for low- and moderate-income families in a manner consistent with their overall public purposes, while maintaining a strong financial condition and a reasonable economic return; and</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(8) the Federal Home Loan Bank Act [12 U.S.C. 1421 et seq.] should be amended to emphasize that providing for financial safety and soundness of the Federal Home Loan Banks is the primary mission of the Federal Housing Finance Board.</p>

<h3 class="section-head">&sect;4547. Enterprise guarantee fees</h3>
<!-- field-end:head -->
<!-- field-start:statute -->
<h4 class="subsection-head">(a) Definitions</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">For purposes of this section, the following definitions shall apply:</p>
<h4 class="paragraph-head">(1) Guarantee fee</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">The term &quot;guarantee fee&quot;&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(A) means a fee described in subsection (b); and</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(B) includes&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-3em">(i) the guaranty fee charged by the Federal National Mortgage Association with respect to mortgage-backed securities; and</p>
<p class="statutory-body-3em">(ii) the management and guarantee fee charged by the Federal Home Loan Mortgage Corporation with respect to participation certificates.</p>
<h4 class="paragraph-head">(2) Average fees</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">The term &quot;average fees&quot; means the average contractual fee rate of single-family guaranty arrangements by an enterprise entered into during 2011, plus the recognition of any up-front cash payments over an estimated average life, expressed in terms of basis points. Such definition shall be interpreted in a manner consistent with the annual report on guarantee fees by the Federal Housing Finance Agency.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(b) Increase</h4>
<h4 class="paragraph-head">(1) In general</h4>
<h4 class="subparagraph-head">(A) Phased increase required</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">Subject to subsection (c), the Director shall require each enterprise to charge a guarantee fee in connection with any guarantee of the timely payment of principal and interest on securities, notes, and other obligations based on or backed by mortgages on residential real properties designed principally for occupancy of from 1 to 4 families, consummated after December 23, 2011.</p>
<h4 class="subparagraph-head">(B) Amount</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">The amount of the increase required under this section shall be determined by the Director to appropriately reflect the risk of loss, as well&#160;<sup><a href="#4547_1_target" name="4547_1">1</a></sup> the cost of capital allocated to similar assets held by other fully private regulated financial institutions, but such amount shall be not less than an average increase of 10 basis points for each origination year or book year above the average fees imposed in 2011 for such guarantees. The Director shall prohibit an enterprise from offsetting the cost of the fee to mortgage originators, borrowers, and investors by decreasing other charges, fees, or premiums, or in any other manner.</p>
<h4 class="paragraph-head">(2) Authority to limit offer of guarantee</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">The Director shall prohibit an enterprise from consummating any offer for a guarantee to a lender for mortgage-backed securities, if&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(A) the guarantee is inconsistent with the requirements of this section; or</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(B) the risk of loss is allowed to increase, through lowering of the underwriting standards or other means, for the primary purpose of meeting the requirements of this section.</p>
<h4 class="paragraph-head">(3) Deposit in Treasury</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">Amounts received from fee increases imposed under this section shall be deposited directly into the United States Treasury, and shall be available only to the extent provided in subsequent appropriations Acts. The fees charged pursuant to this section shall not be considered a reimbursement to the Federal Government for the costs or subsidy provided to an enterprise.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(c) Phase-in</h4>
<h4 class="paragraph-head">(1) In general</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">The Director may provide for compliance with subsection (b) by allowing each enterprise to increase the guarantee fee charged by the enterprise gradually over the 2-year period beginning on December 23, 2011, in a manner sufficient to comply with this section. In determining a schedule for such increases, the Director shall&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(A) provide for uniform pricing among lenders;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(B) provide for adjustments in pricing based on risk levels; and</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(C) take into consideration conditions in financial markets.</p>
<h4 class="paragraph-head">(2) Rule of construction</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">Nothing in this subsection shall be interpreted to undermine the minimum increase required by subsection (b).</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(d) Information collection and annual analysis</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">The Director shall require each enterprise to provide to the Director, as part of its annual report submitted to Congress&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(1) a description of&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(A) changes made to up-front fees and annual fees as part of the guarantee fees negotiated with lenders;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(B) changes to the riskiness of the new borrowers compared to previous origination years or book years; and</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(C) any adjustments required to improve for future origination years or book years, in order to be in complete compliance with subsection (b); and</p>
<br class="Q04" />
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(2) an assessment of how the changes in the guarantee fees described in paragraph (1) met the requirements of subsection (b).</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(e) Enforcement</h4>
<h4 class="paragraph-head">(1) Required adjustments</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">Based on the information from subsection (d) and any other information the Director <!-- PDFPage:1668 -->deems necessary, the Director shall require an enterprise to make adjustments in its guarantee fee in order to be in compliance with subsection (b).</p>
<h4 class="paragraph-head">(2) Noncompliance penalty</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">An enterprise that has been found to be out of compliance with subsection (b) for any 2 consecutive years shall be precluded from providing any guarantee for a period, determined by rule of the Director, but in no case less than 1 year.</p>
<h4 class="paragraph-head">(3) Rule of construction</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">Nothing in this subsection shall be interpreted as preventing the Director from initiating and implementing an enforcement action against an enterprise, at a time the Director deems necessary, under other existing enforcement authority.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(f) Expiration</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">The provisions of this section shall expire on October 1, 2032.</p>

<p class="statutory-body-2em">(C) Very low-income families.</p>

<p class="statutory-body-1em">A goal for purchase of conventional, conforming mortgages on owner-occupied, single-family housing for low-income families that are given to pay off or prepay an existing loan secured by the same property.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(b) Goals as a percentage of total mortgage purchases</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">The goals established under paragraphs (1) and (2) of subsection (a) shall be established as a percentage of the total number of conventional, conforming, single-family, owner-occupied, purchase money mortgages purchased by the enterprise, or as percentage of the total number of conventional, single-family, owner-occupied refinance mortgages purchased by the enterprise, as applicable, that are mortgages for the types of families specified in paragraphs (1) and (2) of subsection (a).</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(c) Single-family, owner-occupied rental housing units</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">The Director shall require each enterprise to report the number of rental housing units affordable to low-income families each year which are contained in mortgages purchased by the enterprise financing 2- to 4-unit single-family, owner-occupied properties and may, by regulation, establish additional requirements relating to such units.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(d) Determination of compliance</h4>
<h4 class="paragraph-head">(1) In general</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">The Director shall determine, for each year that the housing goals under this section are in effect pursuant to section 4561(a) of this title, whether each enterprise has complied with each such goal established under subsection (a) of this section and any additional requirements which may be established under subsection (c) of this section.</p>

<p class="statutory-body-1em">An enterprise shall be considered to be in compliance with a housing goal under subparagraph (A), (B), or (C) of subsection (a)(1) for a year only if, for the type of family described in such subparagraph, the percentage of the number of conventional, conforming, single-family, owner-occupied, purchase money mortgages purchased by the enterprise in such year that serve such families, meets or exceeds the target for the year for such type of family that is established under subsection (e).</p>

<h4 class="subsection-head">(a) Establishment of goal</h4>
<h4 class="paragraph-head">(1) In general</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">The Director shall, by regulation, establish a single annual goal, by either unit or dollar volume, of purchases by each enterprise of mortgages on multifamily housing that finance dwelling units affordable to low-income families.</p>
<h4 class="paragraph-head">(2) Additional requirements for units affordable to very low-income families</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">When establishing the goal under this section, the Director shall establish additional requirements for the purchase by each enterprise of mortgages on multifamily housing that finance dwelling units affordable to very low-income families.</p>
<h4 class="paragraph-head">(3) Reporting on smaller properties</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">The Director shall require each enterprise to report on the purchase by each enterprise of multifamily housing of a smaller or limited size that is affordable to low-income families, which may be based on multifamily projects of 5 to 50 units (as such numbers may be adjusted by the Director) or on mortgages of up to $5,000,000 (as such amount may be adjusted by the Director), and may, by regulation, establish such aditional&#160;<sup><a href="#4563_1_target" name="4563_1">1</a></sup> requirements related to such units.</p>
<h4 class="paragraph-head">(4) Factors</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">In establishing the goal and additional requirements under this section, the Director shall not consider segments of the market determined to be inconsistent with safety and soundness or unauthorized for purchase by the enterprises, and shall take into consideration&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(A) national multifamily mortgage credit needs and the ability of the enterprise to provide additional liquidity and stability for the multifamily mortgage market;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(B) the performance and effort of the enterprise in making mortgage credit available for multifamily housing in previous years;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(C) the size of the multifamily mortgage market for housing affordable to low-income and very low-income families, including the size of the multifamily markets for housing of a smaller or limited size;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(D) the ability of the enterprise to lead the market in making multifamily mortgage credit available, especially for multifamily housing described in paragraphs (1) and (2);</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(E) the availability of public subsidies; and</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(F) the need to maintain the sound financial condition of the enterprise.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(b) Units financed by housing finance agency bonds</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">The Director shall give full credit toward the achievement of the multifamily special affordable housing goal under this section (for purposes of section 4566 of this title) to dwelling units in multifamily housing that otherwise qualifies under such goal and that is financed by tax-exempt or taxable bonds issued by a State or local housing finance agency, if such bonds, in whole or in part&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(1) are secured by a guarantee of the enterprise; or</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(2) are purchased by the enterprise, except that the Director may give less than full credit for purchases of investment grade bonds, to the extent that such purchases do not provide a new market or add liquidity to an existing market.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(c) Measurement of performance</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">The Director shall monitor the performance of each enterprise in meeting the goals established under this section and shall evaluate such performance (for purposes of section 4566 of this title) based on whether the rent levels are affordable. A rent level shall be considered to be affordable for purposes of this subsection for low-income families if it does not exceed 30 percent of the maximum income level of such income category, with appropriate adjustments for unit size as measured by the number of bedrooms.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(d) Determination of compliance</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">The Director shall determine, for each year that the housing goal under this section is in effect pursuant to section 4561(a) of this title, whether each enterprise has complied with such goal and the additional requirements under subsection (a)(2).</p>

<h4 class="subsection-head">(a) In general</h4>
<h4 class="paragraph-head">(1) Authority</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">The Director shall monitor and enforce compliance with the housing goals established under this subpart and with the duty under section 4565(a) of this title of each enterprise with respect to underserved markets, as provided in this section.</p>
<h4 class="paragraph-head">(2) Guidelines</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">The Director shall establish guidelines to measure the extent of compliance with the housing goals, which, except as provided in paragraph (5), may assign full credit, partial credit, or no credit toward achievement of the housing goals to different categories of mortgage purchase activities of the enterprises, based on such criteria as the Director deems appropriate.</p>
<h4 class="paragraph-head">(3) Extent of compliance</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">In determining compliance with the housing goals established under this subpart, the Director&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(A) shall consider any single mortgage purchased by an enterprise as contributing to the achievement of each housing goal for which such mortgage purchase qualifies; and</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(B) may take into consideration the number of housing units financed by any mortgage on housing purchased by an enterprise.</p>
<!-- PDFPage:1674 --><h4 class="paragraph-head">(4) Enforcement of duty to provide mortgage credit to underserved markets</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">The duty under section 4565(a) of this title of each enterprise to serve underserved markets (as determined in accordance with section 4565(c) of this title) shall be enforceable under this section to the same extent and under the same provisions that the housing goals established under this subpart are enforceable. Such duty shall be enforceable only under this section, except that such duty shall not be subject to subsection (c)(7) of this section and shall not be enforceable under any other provision of this chapter (including subpart 3 of this part) or under any provision of the Federal National Mortgage Association Charter Act [12 U.S.C. 1716 et seq.] or the Federal Home Loan Mortgage Corporation Act [12 U.S.C. 1451 et seq.].</p>
<h4 class="paragraph-head">(5) Additional credit</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">The Director may assign additional credit toward achievement, under this section, of the housing goals for mortgage purchase activities of the enterprises that comply with the requirements of such goals and support housing that includes a licensed childcare center. The availability of additional credit under this paragraph shall not be used to increase any housing goal, subgoal, or target established under this subpart.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(b) Notice and preliminary determination of failure to meet goals</h4>
<h4 class="paragraph-head">(1) Notice</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">If the Director preliminarily determines that an enterprise has failed, or that there is a substantial probability that an enterprise will fail, to meet any housing goal under this subpart, the Director shall provide written notice to the enterprise of such a preliminary determination, the reasons for such determination, and the information on which the Director based the determination.</p>
<h4 class="paragraph-head">(2) Response period</h4>
<h4 class="subparagraph-head">(A) In general</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">During the 30-day period beginning on the date on which an enterprise is provided notice under paragraph (1), the enterprise may submit to the Director any written information that the enterprise considers appropriate for consideration by the Director in finally determining whether such failure has occurred or whether the achievement of such goal was or is feasible.</p>
<h4 class="subparagraph-head">(B) Extended period</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">The Director may extend the period under subparagraph (A) for good cause for not more than 30 additional days.</p>
<h4 class="subparagraph-head">(C) Shortened period</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">The Director may shorten the period under subparagraph (A) for good cause.</p>
<h4 class="subparagraph-head">(D) Failure to respond</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">The failure of an enterprise to provide information during the 30-day period under this paragraph (as extended or shortened) shall waive any right of the enterprise to comment on the proposed determination or action of the Director.</p>
<h4 class="paragraph-head">(3) Consideration of information and final determination</h4>
<h4 class="subparagraph-head">(A) In general</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">After the expiration of the response period under paragraph (2), or upon receipt of information provided during such period by the enterprise, whichever occurs earlier, the Director shall issue a final determination on&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-3em">(i) whether the enterprise has failed, or there is a substantial probability that the enterprise will fail, to meet the housing goal; and</p>
<p class="statutory-body-3em">(ii) whether (taking into consideration market and economic conditions and the financial condition of the enterprise) the achievement of the housing goal was or is feasible.</p>
<h4 class="subparagraph-head">(B) Considerations</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">In making a final determination under subparagraph (A), the Director shall take into consideration any relevant information submitted by the enterprise during the response period.</p>
<h4 class="subparagraph-head">(C) Notice</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">The Director shall provide written notice, including a response to any information submitted during the response period, to the enterprise, the Committee on Banking, Housing, and Urban Affairs of the Senate, and the Committee on Financial Services of the House of Representatives, of&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-3em">(i) each final determination under this paragraph that an enterprise has failed, or that there is a substantial probability that the enterprise will fail, to meet a housing goal;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-3em">(ii) each final determination that the achievement of a housing goal was or is feasible; and</p>
<p class="statutory-body-3em">(iii) the reasons for each such final determination.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(c) Cease and desist, civil money penalties, and remedies including housing plans</h4>
<h4 class="paragraph-head">(1) Requirement</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">If the Director finds, pursuant to subsection (b), that there is a substantial probability that an enterprise will fail, or has actually failed, to meet any housing goal under this subpart, and that the achievement of the housing goal was or is feasible, the Director may require that the enterprise submit a housing plan under this subsection. If the Director makes such a finding and the enterprise refuses to submit such a plan, submits an unacceptable plan, or fails to comply with the plan, the Director may issue a cease and desist order in accordance with section 4581 of this title and impose civil money penalties in accordance with section 4585 of this title.</p>
<h4 class="paragraph-head">(2) Housing plan</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">If the Director requires a housing plan under this subsection, such a plan shall be&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(A) a feasible plan describing the specific actions the enterprise will take&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-3em">(i) to achieve the goal for the next calendar year; and</p>
<p class="statutory-body-3em">(ii) if the Director determines that there is a substantial probability that the enter<!-- PDFPage:1675 -->prise will fail to meet a goal in the current year, to make such improvements and changes in its operations as are reasonable in the remainder of such year; and</p>
<br class="Q04" />
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(B) sufficiently specific to enable the Director to monitor compliance periodically.</p>
<h4 class="paragraph-head">(3) Deadline for submission</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">The Director shall establish a deadline for an enterprise to submit a housing plan to the Director, which may not be more than 45 days after the enterprise is provided notice. The Director may extend the deadline to the extent that the Director determines necessary. Any extension of the deadline shall be in writing and for a time certain.</p>
<h4 class="paragraph-head">(4) Approval</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">The Director shall review each submission by an enterprise, including a housing plan submitted under this subsection, and, not later than 30 days after submission, approve or disapprove the plan or other action. The Director may extend the period for approval or disapproval for a single additional 30-day period if the Director determines it necessary. The Director shall approve any plan that the Director determines is likely to succeed, and conforms with the Federal National Mortgage Association Charter Act [12 U.S.C. 1716 et seq.] or the Federal Home Loan Mortgage Corporation Act [12 U.S.C. 1451 et seq.] (as applicable), this chapter, and any other applicable provision of law.</p>
<h4 class="paragraph-head">(5) Notice of approval and disapproval</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">The Director shall provide written notice to any enterprise submitting a housing plan of the approval or disapproval of the plan (which shall include the reasons for any disapproval of the plan) and of any extension of the period for approval or disapproval.</p>
<h4 class="paragraph-head">(6) Resubmission</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">If the initial housing plan submitted by an enterprise under this section is disapproved, the enterprise shall submit an amended plan acceptable to the Director not later than 15 days after such disapproval, or such longer period that the Director determines is in the public interest.</p>
<h4 class="paragraph-head">(7) Cease and desist orders; civil money penalties</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">Solely with respect to the housing goals established under sections 4562(a) and 4563(a)(1) of this title, if the Director requires an enterprise to submit a housing plan under this subsection and the enterprise refuses to submit such a plan, submits an unacceptable plan, or fails to comply with the plan, the Director may issue a cease and desist order in accordance with section 4581 of this title, impose civil money penalties in accordance with section 4585 of this title, exercise other appropriate enforcement authority or seek other appropriate actions.</p>

<p class="statutory-body-1em">A regulated entity that is not classified as critically undercapitalized and is the subject of a classification under section 4614 of this title or a discretionary supervisory action taken under this subchapter by the Director (other than action to appoint a conservator under section 4616 or 4617 of this title or action under section 4619&#160;<sup><a href="#4623_1_target" name="4623_1">1</a></sup> of this title) may obtain review of the classification or action by filing, within 10 days after receiving written notice of the Director's action, a written petition requesting that the classification or action of the Director be modified, terminated, or set aside.</p>
<h4 class="paragraph-head">(2) Place for filing</h4>

<h4 class="subsection-head">(c) Unavailability of stay</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">The commencement of proceedings for judicial review pursuant to this section shall not operate as a stay of any action taken by the Director.

<h4 class="subsection-head">(d) Limitation on jurisdiction</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">Except as provided in this section, no court shall have jurisdiction to affect, by injunction or otherwise, the issuance or effectiveness of any classification or action of the Director under this subchapter (other than appointment of a conservator under section 4616 or 4617 of this title or action under section 4619&#160;<sup><a href="#4623_1_target" name="4623_1">1</a></sup> of this title) or to review, modify, suspend, terminate, or set aside such classification or action.</p>

<h4 class="subsection-head">(c) Incomplete or inaccurate records</h4>
<h4 class="paragraph-head">(1) Temporary order</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">If a notice of charges served under section 4631(a) or (b) of this title specifies on the basis of particular facts and circumstances that the books and records of the regulated entity served are so incomplete or inaccurate that the Director is unable, through the normal supervisory process, to determine the financial condition of the regulated entity or the details or the purpose of any transaction or transactions that may have a material effect on the financial condition of that regulated entity, the Director may issue a temporary order requiring&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(A) the cessation of any activity or practice which gave rise, whether in whole or in part, to the incomplete or inaccurate state of the books or records; or</p>

<h4 class="subsection-head">(d) Judicial review</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">A regulated entity, executive officer, director, or entity-affiliated party that has been served with a temporary order pursuant to this section may apply to the United States District Court for the District of Columbia within 10 days after such service for an injunction setting aside, limiting, or suspending the enforcement, operation, or effectiveness of the order pending the completion of the administrative proceedings pursuant to the notice of charges served upon the enterprise, executive officer, director, or entity-affiliated party under section 4631(a) or (b) of this title. Such court shall have jurisdiction to issue such injunction.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(e) Enforcement by Attorney General</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">In the case of violation or threatened violation of, or failure to obey, a temporary order issued pursuant to this section, the Director may bring an action in the United States District Court for the District of Columbia for an injunction to enforce such order. If the court finds any such violation, threatened violation, or failure to obey, the court shall issue such injunction.</p>
