<p class="statutory-body-1em">(2) Financial market utilities that conduct or support multilateral payment, clearing, or settlement activities may reduce risks for their participants and the broader financial system, but such utilities may also concentrate and create new risks and thus must be well designed and operated in a safe and sound manner.</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(3) Payment, clearing, and settlement activities conducted by financial institutions also present important risks to the participating financial institutions and to the financial system.</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(4) Enhancements to the regulation and supervision of systemically important financial market utilities and the conduct of systemically important payment, clearing, and settlement activities by financial institutions are necessary&mdash;</p>

<p class="statutory-body-2em">(D) to support the stability of the broader financial system.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(b) Purpose</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">The purpose of this subchapter is to mitigate systemic risk in the financial system and promote financial stability by&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(1) authorizing the Board of Governors to promote uniform standards for the&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(A) management of risks by systemically important financial market utilities; and</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(B) conduct of systemically important payment, clearing, and settlement activities by financial institutions;</p>
<br class="Q04" />
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(2) providing the Board of Governors an enhanced role in the supervision of risk management standards for systemically important financial market utilities;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(3) strengthening the liquidity of systemically important financial market utilities; and</p>

<p class="statutory-body">Whenever a service integral to the operation of a designated financial market utility is performed for the designated financial market utility by another entity, whether an affiliate or non-affiliate and whether on or off the premises of the designated financial market utility, the Supervisory Agency may examine whether the provision of that service is in compliance with applicable law, rules, orders, and standards to the same extent as if the designated financial market utility were performing the service on its own premises.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(c) Enforcement</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">For purposes of enforcing the provisions of this subchapter, a designated financial market <!-- PDFPage:1935 -->utility shall be subject to, and the appropriate Supervisory Agency shall have authority under the provisions of subsections (b) through (n) of section 1818 of this title in the same manner and to the same extent as if the designated financial market utility was an insured depository institution and the Supervisory Agency was the appropriate Federal banking agency for such insured depository institution.</p>

<p class="statutory-body-1em">The Supervisory Agency shall consider the recommendation of the Board of Governors and submit a response to the Board of Governors within 60 days.</p>
<h4 class="paragraph-head">(3) Binding arbitration</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">If the Supervisory Agency rejects, in whole or in part, the recommendation of the Board of Governors, the Board of Governors may refer the recommendation to the Council for a binding decision on whether an enforcement action is warranted.</p>
<h4 class="paragraph-head">(4) Enforcement action</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">Upon an affirmative vote by a majority of the Council in favor of the Board of Governors&apos; recommendation under paragraph (3), the Council may require the Supervisory Agency to&mdash;</p>

<p class="statutory-body-3em">(ii) the condition of a designated financial market utility poses an imminent risk of substantial harm to financial institutions, critical markets, or the broader financial system; and</p>
<br class="Q04" />
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(B) the imminent risk of substantial harm precludes the Board of Governors&apos; use of the procedures in subsection (e).</p>
