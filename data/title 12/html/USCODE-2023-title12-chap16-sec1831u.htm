<p class="statutory-body-2em">Notwithstanding paragraph (1), a merger transaction may not be approved pursuant to paragraph (1) if the transaction involves a bank the home State of which has enacted a law after September 29, 1994, and before June 1, 1997, that&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-3em">(i) applies equally to all out-of-State banks; and</p>

<h4 class="subparagraph-head">(A) In general</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">A merger transaction may be approved pursuant to paragraph (1) before June 1, 1997, if the home State of each bank involved in the transaction has in effect, as of the date of the approval of such transaction, a law that&mdash;</p>

<h4 class="subparagraph-head">(A) In general</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">An interstate merger transaction may involve the acquisition of a branch of an insured bank without the acquisition of the bank only if the law of the State in which the branch is located permits out-of-State banks to acquire a branch of a bank in such State without acquiring the bank.</p>
<h4 class="subparagraph-head">(B) Treatment of branch for purposes of this section</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">In the case of an interstate merger transaction which involves the acquisition of a branch of an insured bank without the acquisition of the bank, the branch shall be treated, for purposes of this section, as an insured bank the home State of which is the State in which the branch is located.</p>
<h4 class="paragraph-head">(5) Preservation of State age laws</h4>
<h4 class="subparagraph-head">(A) In general</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">The responsible agency may not approve an application pursuant to paragraph (1) that would have the effect of permitting an out-of-State bank or out-of-State bank holding company to acquire a bank in a host State that has not been in existence for the minimum period of time, if any, specified in the statutory law of the host State.</p>

<h4 class="subparagraph-head">(D) Exceptions to subparagraph (B)</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">The responsible agency may approve an application for an interstate merger transaction pursuant to subsection (a) without regard to the applicability of subparagraph (B) with respect to any State if&mdash;</p>

<p class="statutory-body-2em">This paragraph shall not apply with respect to any interstate merger transaction involving only affiliated banks.</p>

<h4 class="paragraph-head">(1) State taxation authority not affected</h4>
<h4 class="subparagraph-head">(A) In general</h4>

<h4 class="subparagraph-head">(B) Imposition of shares tax by host States</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">In the case of a branch of an out-of-State bank which results from an interstate merger transaction, a proportionate amount of the value of the shares of the out-of-State bank may be subject to any bank shares tax levied or imposed by the host State, or any political subdivision of such host State that imposes such tax based upon a method adopted by the host State, which may include allocation and apportionment.</p>
