<h4 class="paragraph-head">(1) Amount of payment</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">Each enterprise shall pay to the Director a proportion of the annual assessment made pursuant to subsection (a) that bears the same ratio to the total annual assessment that the total assets of each enterprise bears&#160;<sup><a href="#4516_1_target" name="4516_1">1</a></sup> to the total assets of both enterprises.</p>
<h4 class="paragraph-head">(2) Separate treatment of Federal home loan bank and enterprise assessments</h4>
