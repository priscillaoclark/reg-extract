<p class="statutory-body-2em">(E) The extent to which the interest of the local community in having adequate deposit and credit services available would be threatened by the forfeiture of the franchise.</p>

<p class="statutory-body-1em">This subsection shall not apply to a successor to the interests of, or a person who acquires, a bank, a Federal branch, or a Federal agency that violated a provision of law described in paragraph (1), if the successor succeeds to the interests of the violator, or the acquisition is made, in good faith and not for purposes of evading this subsection or regulations prescribed under this subsection.</p>
<h4 class="paragraph-head">(4) &quot;Senior executive officer&quot; defined</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">The term &quot;senior executive officer&quot; has the same meaning as in regulations prescribed under section 1831i(f) of this title.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(d)&#160;<sup><a href="#93_5_target" name="93_5">5</a></sup> Authority</h4>
