<p class="statutory-body">Nothing in this section shall be construed to prevent States from establishing requirements <!-- PDFPage:1533 -->in addition to any rules promulgated under subsection (a).</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(c) Federally regulated financial institutions</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">The requirements of subsection (a) shall apply to an appraisal management company that is a subsidiary owned and controlled by a financial institution and regulated by a Federal financial institution regulatory agency. An appraisal management company that is a subsidiary owned and controlled by a financial institution regulated by a Federal financial institution regulatory agency shall not be required to register with a State.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(d) Registration limitations</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">An appraisal management company shall not be registered by a State or included on the national registry if such company, in whole or in part, directly or indirectly, is owned by any person who has had an appraiser license or certificate refused, denied, cancelled, surrendered in lieu of revocation, or revoked in any State. Additionally, each person that owns more than 10 percent of an appraisal management company shall be of good moral character, as determined by the State appraiser certifying and licensing agency, and shall submit to a background investigation carried out by the State appraiser certifying and licensing agency.</p>

<h4 class="paragraph-head">(2) Extension of effective date</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">Subject to the approval of the Council, the Appraisal Subcommittee may extend by an additional 12 months the requirements for the registration and supervision of appraisal management companies if it makes a written finding that a State has made substantial progress in establishing a State appraisal management company registration and supervision system that appears to conform with the provisions of this chapter.</p>
