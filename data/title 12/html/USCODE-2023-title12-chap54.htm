<h4 class="subsection-head">(d) Additional considerations</h4>

<p class="statutory-body-1em">(1) The anticipated benefits to the State, its businesses, and its residents to be derived from the Federal contributions to, or for the account of, the approved State other credit support program, including the extent to which resulting small business lending will expand economic opportunities.</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(2) The operational capacity, skills, and experience of the management team of the State other credit support program.</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(3) The capacity of the State other credit support program to manage increases in the volume of its small business lending.</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(4) The internal accounting and administrative controls systems of the State other credit support program, and the extent to which they can provide reasonable assurance that funds of the State program are safeguarded against waste, loss, unauthorized use, or misappropriation.</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(5) The soundness of the program design and implementation plan of the State other credit support program.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(e) Federal contributions to approved State other credit support programs</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">A State other credit support program approved under this section will be eligible for receiving Federal contributions to, or for the account of, the State program in an amount consistent with the schedule describing the apportionment of allocated Federal funds among State programs delivered by the State to the Secretary under the allocation agreement.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(f) Minimum Program Requirements for State other credit support programs</h4>
<h4 class="paragraph-head">(1) Fund&#160;<sup><a href="#5705_1_target" name="5705_1">1</a></sup> to prescribe</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">The Secretary shall, by regulation or other guidance, prescribe Program requirements for approved State other credit support programs.</p>
<h4 class="paragraph-head">(2) Considerations for fund</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">In prescribing minimum Program requirements for approved State other credit support programs, the Secretary shall take into consideration, to the extent the Secretary determines applicable and appropriate, the minimum Program requirements for approved State capital access programs in section 5704(e) of this title.</p>
