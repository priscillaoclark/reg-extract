<p class="note-body">By the authority vested in me as President by the Constitution and the laws of the United States of America, it is hereby ordered as follows:</p>
<p class="note-body"><cap-smallcap>Section</cap-smallcap> 1. <i>Revision</i>. (a) The National Credit Union Administration Board has caused to be made, and has recommended approval of, a new seal of office for the National Credit Union Administration (NCUA), the design of which accompanies and is hereby made a part of this order [not set out in the Code], and which is described as follows:</p>
<p class="note-body">(i) The eagle overlaid by the shield conveys the NCUA's role as an agency of the Federal Government. The text, &quot;NCUA,&quot; in white on a blue background on the crest of the shield is the core of the sign that federally insured credit unions are required to display.</p>
<p class="note-body">(ii) The three stars above the eagle represent the NCUA's three-member Board, appointed by the President of the United States by and with the advice and consent of the Senate.</p>
<p class="note-body">(iii) The oak branch the eagle is holding in its left talon symbolizes the NCUA's strength, honor, and longevity in carrying out its mission of promoting confidence in the national system of cooperative credit.</p>
<p class="note-body">(iv) The olive branch the eagle is holding in its right talon symbolizes the peace and prosperity facilitated by the economic growth and access to affordable financial services that the Nation's credit unions have long provided to millions of Americans.</p>
<p class="note-body">(v) The upper portion of the circle that forms the border of the seal sets forth the agency's title, &quot;National Credit Union Administration.&quot; The date &quot;1934&quot; in the lower portion of the circle reflects the creation of the Federal credit union system by the Congress in 1934 and the long unbroken line of Federal credit union regulation that evolved into the NCUA.</p>
<p class="note-body">(b) This seal is of suitable design and appropriate for adoption as the official seal of the NCUA.</p>
<p class="note-body">(c) I hereby approve this seal as the official seal of the NCUA.</p>
<p class="note-body"><cap-smallcap>Sec</cap-smallcap>. 2. <i>Revocation</i>. Executive Order 11580 of January 20, 1971 (Establishing a Seal for the National Credit Union Administration), as amended, is hereby revoked.</p>

<p class="note-body">(ii) the functions of the Director of the Office of Management and Budget relating to budgetary, administrative, or legislative proposals.</p>
<p class="note-body">(b) This order shall be implemented consistent with applicable law and subject to the availability of appropriations.</p>
<p class="note-body">(c) This order is not intended to, and does not, create any right or benefit, substantive or procedural, enforceable at law or in equity by any party against the United States, its departments, agencies, or entities, its officers, employees, or agents, or any other person.</p>

<h4 class="subsection-head">(a) In general</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">Subject to subsection (b), Federal credit union membership shall consist of the incorporators and such other persons and incorporated and unincorporated organizations, to the extent permitted by rules and regulations prescribed by the Board, as may be elected to membership and as such shall each, subscribe to at least one share of its stock and pay the initial installment thereon and a uniform entrance fee if required by the board of directors. Shares may be issued in joint tenancy with right of survivorship with any persons designated by the credit union member, but no joint tenant shall be permitted to vote, obtain loans, or hold office, unless he is within the field of membership and is a qualified member.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(b) Membership field</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">Subject to the other provisions of this section, the membership of any Federal credit union shall be limited to the membership described in one of the following categories:</p>

<h4 class="paragraph-head">(2) Multiple common-bond credit union</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">More than one group&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(A) each of which has (within the group) a common bond of occupation or association; and</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(B) the number of members, each of which (at the time the group is first included within the field of membership of a credit union described in this paragraph) does not exceed any numerical limitation applicable under subsection (d).</p>
<h4 class="paragraph-head">(3) Community credit union</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">Persons or organizations within a well-defined local community, neighborhood, or rural district.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(c) Exceptions</h4>
<h4 class="paragraph-head">(1) Grandfathered members and groups</h4>
<h4 class="subparagraph-head">(A) In general</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">Notwithstanding subsection (b)&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-3em">(i) any person or organization that is a member of any Federal credit union as of August 7, 1998, may remain a member of the credit union after August 7, 1998; and</p>
<p class="statutory-body-3em">(ii) a member of any group whose members constituted a portion of the membership of any Federal credit union as of August 7, 1998, shall continue to be eligible to become a member of that credit union, by virtue of membership in that group, after August 7, 1998.</p>
<h4 class="subparagraph-head">(B) Successors</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">If the common bond of any group referred to in subparagraph (A) is defined by any particular organization or business entity, subparagraph (A) shall continue to apply with respect to any successor to the organization or entity.</p>
<h4 class="paragraph-head">(2) Exception for underserved areas</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">Notwithstanding subsection (b), in the case of a Federal credit union, the field of membership category of which is described in subsection (b)(2), the Board may allow the membership of the credit union to include any person or organization within a local community, neighborhood, or rural district if&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(A) the Board determines that the local community, neighborhood, or rural district&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-3em">(i) is an &quot;investment area&quot;, as defined in section 4702(16) of this title, and meets such additional requirements as the Board may impose; and</p>
<p class="statutory-body-3em">(ii) is underserved, based on data of the Board and the Federal banking agencies (as defined in section 1813 of this title), by other depository institutions (as defined in section 461(b)(1)(A) of this title); and</p>
<br class="Q04" />
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(B) the credit union establishes and maintains an office or facility in the local community, neighborhood, or rural district at which credit union services are available.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(d) Multiple common-bond credit union group requirements</h4>
<h4 class="paragraph-head">(1) Numerical limitation</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">Except as provided in paragraph (2), only a group with fewer than 3,000 members shall be eligible to be included in the field of membership category of a credit union described in subsection (b)(2).</p>
<h4 class="paragraph-head">(2) Exceptions</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">In the case of any Federal credit union, the field of membership category of which is described in subsection (b)(2), the numerical limitation in paragraph (1) of this subsection shall not apply with respect to&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(A) any group that the Board determines, in writing and in accordance with the guide<!-- PDFPage:868 -->lines and regulations issued under paragraph (3), could not feasibly or reasonably establish a new single common-bond credit union, the field of membership category of which is described in subsection (b)(1) because&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-3em">(i) the group lacks sufficient volunteer and other resources to support the efficient and effective operation of a credit union;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-3em">(ii) the group does not meet the criteria that the Board has determined to be important for the likelihood of success in establishing and managing a new credit union, including demographic characteristics such as geographical location of members, diversity of ages and income levels, and other factors that may affect the financial viability and stability of a credit union; or</p>
<p class="statutory-body-3em">(iii) the group would be unlikely to operate a safe and sound credit union;</p>
<br class="Q04" />
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(B) any group transferred from another credit union&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-3em">(i) in connection with a merger or consolidation recommended by the Board or any appropriate State credit union supervisor based on safety and soundness concerns with respect to that other credit union; or</p>
<p class="statutory-body-3em">(ii) by the Board in the Board's capacity as conservator or liquidating agent with respect to that other credit union; or</p>
<br class="Q04" />
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(C) any group transferred in connection with a voluntary merger, having received conditional approval by the Administration of the merger application prior to October 25, 1996, but not having consummated the merger prior to October 25, 1996, if the merger is consummated not later than 180 days after August 7, 1998.</p>
<h4 class="paragraph-head">(3) Regulations and guidelines</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">The Board shall issue guidelines or regulations, after notice and opportunity for comment, setting forth the criteria that the Board will apply in determining under this subsection whether or not an additional group may be included within the field of membership category of an existing credit union described in subsection (b)(2).</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(e) Additional membership eligibility provisions</h4>
<h4 class="paragraph-head">(1) Membership eligibility limited to immediate family or household members</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">No individual shall be eligible for membership in a credit union on the basis of the relationship of the individual to another person who is eligible for membership in the credit union, unless the individual is a member of the immediate family or household (as those terms are defined by the Board, by regulation) of the other person.</p>
<h4 class="paragraph-head">(2) Retention of membership</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">Except as provided in section 1764 of this title, once a person becomes a member of a credit union in accordance with this subchapter, that person or organization may remain a member of that credit union until the person or organization chooses to withdraw from the membership of the credit union.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(f) Criteria for approval of expansion of multiple common-bond credit unions</h4>
<h4 class="paragraph-head">(1) In general</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">The Board shall&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(A) encourage the formation of separately chartered credit unions instead of approving an application to include an additional group within the field of membership of an existing credit union whenever practicable and consistent with reasonable standards for the safe and sound operation of the credit union; and</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(B) if the formation of a separate credit union by the group is not practicable or consistent with the standards referred to in subparagraph (A), require the inclusion of the group in the field of membership of a credit union that is within reasonable proximity to the location of the group whenever practicable and consistent with reasonable standards for the safe and sound operation of the credit union.</p>
<h4 class="paragraph-head">(2) Approval criteria</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">The Board may not approve any application by a Federal credit union, the field of membership category of which is described in subsection (b)(2) to include any additional group within the field of membership of the credit union (or an application by a Federal credit union described in subsection (b)(1) to include an additional group and become a credit union described in subsection (b)(2)), unless the Board determines, in writing, that&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(A) the credit union has not engaged in any unsafe or unsound practice (as defined in section 1786(b) of this title) that is material during the 1-year period preceding the date of filing of the application;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(B) the credit union is adequately capitalized;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(C) the credit union has the administrative capability to serve the proposed membership group and the financial resources to meet the need for additional staff and assets to serve the new membership group;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(D) any potential harm that the expansion of the field of membership of the credit union may have on any other insured credit union and its members is clearly outweighed in the public interest by the probable beneficial effect of the expansion in meeting the convenience and needs of the members of the group proposed to be included in the field of membership; and</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(E) the credit union has met such additional requirements as the Board may prescribe, by regulation.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(g) Regulations required for community credit unions</h4>
<h4 class="paragraph-head">(1) Definition of well-defined local community, neighborhood, or rural district</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">The Board shall prescribe, by regulation, a definition for the term &quot;well-defined local community, neighborhood, or rural district&quot; for purposes of&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(A) making any determination with regard to the field of membership of a credit union described in subsection (b)(3); and</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(B) establishing the criteria applicable with respect to any such determination.</p>
<!-- PDFPage:869 --><h4 class="paragraph-head">(2) Scope of application</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">The definition prescribed by the Board under paragraph (1) shall apply with respect to any application to form a new credit union, or to alter or expand the field of membership of an existing credit union, that is filed with the Board after August 7, 1998.</p>

<h3 class="section-head">&sect;1766. Powers of Board</h3>
<!-- field-end:head -->
<!-- field-start:statute -->
<p class="statutory-body">(a) The Board may prescribe rules and regulations for the administration of this chapter (including, but not by way of limitation, the merger, consolidation, and dissolution of corporations organized under this chapter). Any central credit union chartered by the Board shall be subject to such rules, regulations, and orders as the Board deems appropriate and, except as otherwise specifically provided in such rules, regulations, or orders, shall be vested with or subject to the same rights, privileges, duties, restrictions, penalties, liabilities, conditions, and limitations that would apply to all Federal credit unions under this chapter.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(b)(1) The Board may suspend or revoke the charter of any Federal credit union, or place the same in involuntary liquidation and appoint a liquidating agent therefor, upon its finding that the organization is bankrupt or insolvent, or has violated any of the provisions of its charter, its bylaws, this chapter, or any regulations issued thereunder.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(2) The Board, through such persons as it shall designate, may examine any Federal credit union in voluntary liquidation and, upon its finding that such voluntary liquidation is not being conducted in an orderly or efficient manner or in the best interests of its members, may terminate such voluntary liquidation and place such organization in involuntary liquidation and appoint a liquidating agent therefor.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(3) Such liquidating agent shall have power and authority, subject to the control and supervision of the Board and under such rules and regulations as the Board may prescribe, (A) to receive and take possession of the books, records, assets, and property of every description of the Federal credit union in liquidation, to sell, enforce collection of, and liquidate all such assets and property, to compound all bad or doubtful debts, and to sue in his own name or in the name of the Federal credit union in liquidation, and defend such actions as may be brought against him as liquidating agent or against the Federal credit union; (B) to receive, examine, and pass upon all claims against the Federal credit union in liquidation, including claims of members on member accounts; (C) to make distribution and payment to creditors and members as their interests may appear; and (D) to execute such documents and papers and to do such other acts and things which he may deem necessary or desirable to discharge his duties hereunder.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(4) Subject to the control and supervision of the Board and under such rules and regulations as the Board may prescribe, the liquidating agent of a Federal credit union in involuntary liquidation shall (A) cause notice to be given to creditors and members to present their claims and make legal proof thereof, which notice shall be published once a week in each of three successive weeks in a newspaper of general circulation in each county in which the Federal credit union in liquidation maintained an office or branch for the transaction of business on the date it ceased unrestricted operations; except that whenever the aggregate book value of the assets and property of a Federal credit union in involuntary liquidation is less than $1,000, unless the Board shall find that its books and records do not contain a true and accurate record of its liabilities he shall declare such Federal credit union in liquidation to be a &quot;no publication&quot; liquidation, and publication of notice to creditors and members shall not be required in such case; (B) from time to time make a ratable dividend on all such claims as may have been proved to his satisfaction or adjudicated in a court of competent jurisdiction and, after the assets of such organization have been liquidated, make further dividends on all claims previously proved or adjudicated, and he may accept in lieu of a formal proof of claim on behalf of any creditor or member the statement of <!-- PDFPage:877 -->any amount due to such creditor or member as shown on the books and records of the credit union; but all claims not filed before payment of the final dividend shall be barred and claims rejected or disallowed by the liquidating agent shall be likewise barred unless suit be instituted thereon within three months after notice of rejection or disallowance; and (C) in a &quot;no publication&quot; liquidation, determine from all sources available to him, and within the limits of available funds of the Federal credit union, the amounts due to creditors and members, and after sixty days shall have elapsed from the date of his appointment distribute the funds of the Federal credit union to creditors and members ratably and as their interests may appear.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(5) Upon certification by the liquidating agent in the case of an involuntary liquidation, and upon such proof as shall be satisfactory to the Board in the case of a voluntary liquidation, that distribution has been made and that liquidation has been completed, as provided herein, the Board shall cancel the charter of such Federal credit union; but the corporate existence of the Federal credit union shall continue for a period of three years from the date of such cancellation of its charter, during which period the liquidating agent, or his duly appointed successor, or such persons as the Board shall designate, may act on behalf of the Federal credit union for the purpose of paying, satisfying, and discharging any existing liabilities or obligations, collecting and distributing its assets, and doing all other acts required to adjust and wind up its business and affairs, and it may sue and be sued in its corporate name.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(c) After the expiration of five years from the date of cancellation of the charter of a Federal credit union the Board may, in its discretion, destroy any or all books and records of such Federal credit union in its possession or under its control.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(d) The Board is authorized and empowered to execute any and all functions and perform any and all duties vested in it hereby, through such persons as it shall designate or employ; and it may delegate to any person or persons, including any institution operating under the general supervision of the Administration, the performance and discharge of any authority, power, or function vested in it by this chapter.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(e) All books and records of Federal credit unions shall be kept and reports shall be made in accordance with forms approved by the Board.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(f)(1) The Board is authorized to make investigations and to conduct researches and studies of the problems of persons of small means in obtaining credit at reasonable rates of interest, and of the methods and benefits of cooperative saving and lending among such persons. It is further authorized to make reports of such investigations and to publish and disseminate the same.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(2)(A) The Board is authorized to conduct directly, or to make grants to or contracts with colleges or universities, State or local educational agencies, or other appropriate public or private nonprofit organizations to conduct, programs for the training of persons engaged, or preparing to engage, in the operation of credit unions, and in related consumer counseling programs, serving the poor. It is authorized to establish a program of experimental, developmental, demonstration, and pilot projects, either directly or by grants to public or private nonprofit organizations, including credit unions, or by contracts with such organizations or other private organizations, designed to promote more effective operation of credit unions, and related consumer counseling programs, serving the poor.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(B) In carrying out its authority under this paragraph, the Board shall consult with officials of the Office of Economic Opportunity and other appropriate Federal agencies responsible for the administration of projects or programs concerned with problems of the poor. The development and operation of programs and projects under this paragraph shall involve maximum feasible participation of residents of the areas and members of the groups served by such programs and projects, with community action agencies established under the provisions of the Economic Opportunity Act of 1964 [42 U.S.C. 2701 et seq.] serving, to the extent feasible, as the means through which such participation is achieved.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(C) In order to carry out the purposes of this paragraph, there is authorized to be appropriated, as a supplement to any funds that may be expended by the Board pursuant to sections 1755 and 1756 of this title for such purposes, not to exceed $300,000 for the fiscal year ending June 30, 1970, and not to exceed $1,000,000 for the fiscal year ending June 30, 1971.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(g) Any officer or employee of the Administration is authorized, when designated for the purpose by the Board, to administer oaths and affirmations and to take affidavits and depositions touching upon any matter within the jurisdiction of the Administration.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(h) The Board is authorized, empowered, and directed to require that every person appointed or elected by any Federal credit union to any position requiring the receipt, payment, or custody of money or other personal property owned by a Federal credit union, or in its custody or control as collateral or otherwise, give bond in a corporate surety company holding a certificate of authority from the Secretary of the Treasury under chapter 93 of title 31, as an acceptable surety on Federal bonds. Any such bond or bonds shall be in a form approved by the Board with a view to providing surety coverage to the Federal credit union with reference to loss by reason of acts of fraud or dishonesty including forgery, theft, embezzlement, wrongful abstraction, or misapplication on the part of the person, directly or through connivance with others, and such other surety coverages as the Board may determine to be reasonably appropriate or as elsewhere required by this chapter. Any such bond or bonds shall be in such an amount in relation to the money or other personal property involved or in relation to the assets of the Federal credit union as the Board may from time to time prescribe by regulation for the purpose of requiring reasonable coverage. In lieu of individual bonds the Board may approve the use of a form of schedule or blanket bond which covers all of the officers and employ<!-- PDFPage:878 -->ees of a Federal credit union whose duties include the receipt, payment, or custody of money or other personal property for or on behalf of the Federal credit union. The Board may also approve the use of a form of excess coverage bond whereby a Federal credit union may obtain an amount of coverage in excess of the basic surety coverage.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(i) In addition to the authority conferred upon it by other sections of this chapter, the Board is authorized in carrying out its functions under this chapter&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(1) to appoint such personnel as may be necessary to enable the Administration to carry out its functions;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(2) to expend such funds, enter into such contracts with public and private organizations and persons, make such payments in advance or by way of reimbursement, acquire and dispose of, by lease or purchase, real or personal property, without regard to the provisions of any other law applicable to executive or independent agencies of the United States, and perform such other functions or acts as it may deem necessary or appropriate to carry out the provisions of this chapter, in accordance with the rules and regulations or policies established by the Board not inconsistent with this chapter; and</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(3) to pay stipends, including allowances for travel to and from the place of residence, to any individual to study in a program assisted under this chapter upon a determination by the Board that assistance to such individual in such studies will be in furtherance of the purposes of this chapter.</p>
<br class="Q04" />
<p class="statutory-body">(j) <cap-smallcap>Staff.&mdash;</cap-smallcap></p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(1) <cap-smallcap>Appointment and compensation</cap-smallcap>.&mdash;The Board shall fix the compensation and number of, and appoint and direct, employees of the Board. Rates of basic pay for employees of the Board may be set and adjusted by the Board without regard to the provisions of chapter 51 or subchapter III of chapter 53 of title 5.</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(2) <cap-smallcap>Additional compensation and benefits</cap-smallcap>.&mdash;The Board may provide additional compensation and benefits to employees of the Board if the same type of compensation or benefits are then being provided by any other Federal bank regulatory agency or, if not then being provided, could be provided by such an agency under applicable provisions of law, rule, or regulation. In setting and adjusting the total amount of compensation and benefits for employees of the Board, the Board shall seek to maintain comparability with other Federal bank regulatory agencies.</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(3) <cap-smallcap>Funding</cap-smallcap>.&mdash;The salaries and expenses of the Board and employees of the Board shall be paid from fees and assessments (including income earned on insurance deposits) levied on insured credit unions under this chapter.</p>

<p class="statutory-body-1em">(1) The proposition for such conversion shall first be approved, and a date set for a vote <!-- PDFPage:881 -->thereon by the members (either at a meeting to be held on such date or by written ballot to be filed on or before such date), by a majority of the directors of the Federal credit union. Written notice of the proposition and of the date set for the vote shall then be delivered in person to each member, or mailed to each member at the address for such member appearing on the records of the credit union, not more than thirty nor less than seven days prior to such date. Approval of the proposition for conversion shall be by the affirmative vote of a majority of the members of the credit union who vote on the proposal. The written notice of the proposition shall in boldface type state that the issue will be decided by a majority of the members who vote.</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(2) A statement of the results of the vote, verified by the affidavits of the president or vice president and the secretary, shall be filed with the Administration within ten days after the vote is taken.</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(3) Promptly after the vote is taken and in no event later than ninety days thereafter, if the proposition for conversion was approved by such vote, the credit union shall take such action as may be necessary under the applicable State law to make it a State credit union, and within ten days after receipt of the State credit union charter there shall be filed with the Administration a copy of the charter thus issued. Upon such filing the credit union shall cease to be a Federal credit union.</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(4) Upon ceasing to be a Federal credit union, such credit union shall no longer be subject to any of the provisions of this chapter. The successor State credit union shall be vested with all of the assets and shall continue responsible for all of the obligations of the Federal credit union to the same extent as though the conversion had not taken place.</p>

<p class="statutory-body">(b)(1) A State credit union, organized under the laws of any State, the District of Columbia, the several Territories and possessions of the United States, the Panama Canal Zone, or the Commonwealth of Puerto Rico, may be converted into a Federal credit union by (A) complying with all State requirements requisite to enabling it to convert to a Federal credit union or to cease being a State credit union, (B) filing with the Administration proof of such compliance, satisfactory to the Board, and (C) filing with the Administration an organization certificate as required by this chapter.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(2) When the Board has been satisfied that all of such requirements, and all other requirements of this chapter, have been complied with, the Board shall approve the organization certificate. Upon such approval, the State credit union shall become a Federal credit union as of the date it ceases to be a State credit union. The Federal credit union shall be vested with all of the assets and shall continue responsible for all of the obligations of the State credit union to the same extent as though the conversion had not taken place.</p>

<p class="statutory-body-1em">(3) The extent to which the credit union has fully cooperated with law enforcement authorities with respect to the investigation of the money laundering offense of which the credit union was found guilty.</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(4) The extent to which the credit union has implemented additional internal controls (since the commission of the offense of which the credit union was found guilty) to prevent the occurrence of any other money laundering offense.</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(5) The extent to which the interest of the local community in having adequate deposit and credit services available would be threatened by the forfeiture of the franchise.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(c) Successor liability</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">This section shall not apply to a successor to the interests of, or a person who acquires, a credit union that violated a provision of law described in subsection (a), if the successor succeeds to the interests of the violator, or the acquisition is made, in good faith and not for purposes of evading this section or regulations prescribed under this section.</p>
