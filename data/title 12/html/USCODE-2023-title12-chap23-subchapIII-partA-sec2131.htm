<h4 class="subsection-head">(a) Interest rates and charges</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">Loans made by a bank for cooperatives shall bear interest at a rate or rates determined by the board of directors of the bank from time to time. In setting rates and charges, it shall be the objective to provide the types of credit needed by eligible borrowers at the lowest reasonable cost on a sound business basis, taking into account the net cost of money to the bank, necessary reserves and expenses of the bank, and services provided. The loan documents may provide for the interest rate or rates to vary from time to time during the repayment period of the loan, in accordance with the rate or rates currently being charged by the bank.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(b) Security</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">Loans shall be made upon such terms, conditions, and security, if any, as may be determined by the bank in accordance with regulations of the Farm Credit Administration.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(c) Lien</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">Each bank for cooperatives shall have a first lien on all stock or other equities in the bank as collateral for the payment of any indebtedness of the owner thereof to the bank.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(d) Cancellation; application on indebtedness</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">In any case where the debt of a borrower is in default, or in any case of liquidation or dissolution of a present or former borrower from a bank for cooperatives, the bank may, but shall not be required to, retire and cancel all or a part of the stock, allocated surplus or contingency reserves, or any other equity in the bank owned by or allocated to such borrower, at the fair market value thereof not exceeding par, and, to the extent required in such cases, corresponding shares and allocations and other equity interests held by a bank in another bank for cooperatives (or any successor bank) on account of such indebtedness, shall be retired or equitably adjusted. In no event shall the bank's equities be retired or canceled if the retirement or cancellation would adversely affect the bank's capital structure, as determined by the Farm Credit Administration.</p>
