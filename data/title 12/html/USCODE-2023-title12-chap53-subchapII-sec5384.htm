<p class="statutory-body-1em">(4) shall consult with the Commission and the Securities Investor Protection Corporation in the case of any covered financial company for which the Corporation has been appointed as receiver that is a broker or dealer registered with the Commission under section 78o(b) of title 15 and is a member of the Securities Investor Protection Corporation, for the purpose of determining whether to transfer to a bridge financial company organized by the Corporation as receiver, without consent of any customer, customer accounts of the covered financial company.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(d) Funding for orderly liquidation</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">Upon its appointment as receiver for a covered financial company, and thereafter as the Corporation may, in its discretion, determine to be necessary or appropriate, the Corporation may make available to the receivership, subject to the conditions set forth in section 5386 of this title and subject to the plan described in section 5390(n)(9) of this title, funds for the orderly liquidation of the covered financial company.

<p class="statutory-body-2em">(B) may only take such lien&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-3em">(i) to secure repayment of funds made available to such covered financial company or covered subsidiary; and</p>
<p class="statutory-body-3em">(ii) if the Corporation determines, after consultation with the State insurance authority, that such lien will not unduly impede or delay the liquidation or rehabilitation of the insurance company, or the recovery by its policyholders;</p>
