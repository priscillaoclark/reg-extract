<!-- field-end:head -->
<!-- field-start:statute -->
<h4 class="subsection-head">(a) Appraisal</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">Upon receiving notice of intent regarding an eligible low-income housing project indicating an intent to extend the low-income affordability restrictions under section 4109 of this title or transfer the housing under section 4110 of this title, the Secretary shall provide for determination of the preservation value of the housing, as follows:</p>
<h4 class="paragraph-head">(1) Appraisers</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">The preservation value shall be determined by 2 independent appraisers, one of whom shall be selected by the Secretary and one of whom shall be selected by the owner. The appraisals shall be conducted not later than 4 months after filing the notice of intent under section 4102 of this title, and the owner shall submit to the Secretary the appraisal made by the owner's selected appraiser not later than 90 days after receipt of the notice under paragraph (2). If the 2 appraisers fail to agree on the preservation value, and the Secretary and the owner also fail to agree on the preservation value, the Secretary and the owner shall jointly select and jointly compensate a third appraiser, whose appraisal shall be binding on the parties.</p>
<h4 class="paragraph-head">(2) Notice</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">Not later than 30 days after the filing of a notice of intent to seek incentives under section 4109 of this title or transfer the property under section 4110 of this title, the Secretary shall provide written notice to the owner filing the notice of intent of&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(A) the need for the owner to acquire an appraisal of the property under paragraph (1);</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(B) the rules and guidelines for such appraisals;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(C) the filing deadline for submission of the appraisal under paragraph (1);</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(D) the need for an appraiser retained by the Secretary to inspect the housing and project financial records; and</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(E) any delegation to the appropriate State agency by the Secretary of responsibilities regarding the appraisal.</p>
<h4 class="paragraph-head">(3) Timeliness</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">The Secretary may approve a plan of action to receive incentives under section 4109 or 4110 of this title only based upon an appraisal conducted in accordance with this subsection that is not more than 30 months old.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(b) Preservation value</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">For purposes of this subchapter, the preservation value of eligible low-income housing appraised under this section shall be&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(1) for purposes of extending the low-income affordability restrictions and receiving incentives under section 4109 of this title, the fair market value of the property based on the highest and best use of the property as residential rental housing; and</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(2) for purposes of transferring the property under section 4110 or 4111 of this title, the fair market value of the housing based on the highest and best use of the property.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(c) Guidelines</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">The Secretary shall provide written guidelines for appraisals of preservation value, which shall assume repayment of the existing federally as<!-- PDFPage:1597 -->sisted mortgage, termination of the existing low-income affordability restrictions, simultaneous termination of any Federal rental assistance, and costs of compliance with any State or local laws of general applicability. The guidelines may permit reliance upon assessments of rehabilitation needs and other conversion costs determined by an appropriate State agency, as determined by the Secretary. The guidelines shall instruct the appraiser to use the greater of actual project operating expenses at the time of the appraisal (based on the average of the actual project operating expenses during the preceding 3 years) or projected operating expenses after conversion in determining preservation value. The guidelines established by the Secretary shall not be inconsistent with customary appraisal standards. The guidelines shall also meet the following requirements:</p>
<h4 class="paragraph-head">(1) Residential rental value</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">In the case of preservation value determined under subsection (b)(1), the guidelines shall assume conversion of the housing to market-rate rental housing and shall establish methods for (A) determining rehabilitation expenditures that would be necessary to bring the housing up to quality standards required to attract and sustain a market rate tenancy upon conversion, and (B) assessing other costs that the owner could reasonably be expected to incur if the owner converted the property to market-rate multifamily rental housing.</p>
<h4 class="paragraph-head">(2) Highest and best use value</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">In the case of preservation value determined under subsection (b)(2), the guidelines shall assume conversion of the housing to highest and best use for the property and shall establish methods for (A) determining any rehabilitation expenditures that would be necessary to convert the housing to such use, and (B) assessing other costs that the owner could reasonably be expected to incur if the owner converted the property to its highest and best use.</p>

<h4 class="subsection-head">(a) Determination of relationship to Federal cost limits</h4>
<h4 class="paragraph-head">(1) Initial determination</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">For each eligible low-income housing project appraised under section 4103(a) of this title, the Secretary shall determine whether the aggregate preservation rents for the project determined under paragraph (1) or (2) of section 4104(b) of this title exceed the amount determined by multiplying 120 percent of the fair market rental (established under section 1437f(c) of title 42) for the market area in which the housing is located by the number of dwelling units in the project (according to appropriate unit sizes).</p>
<h4 class="paragraph-head">(2) Relevant local markets</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">If the aggregate preservation rents for a project exceeds the amount determined under paragraph (1), the Secretary shall determine whether such aggregate rents exceed the amount determined by multiplying 120 percent of the prevailing rents in the relevant local market area in which the housing is located by the number of units in the project (according to the appropriate unit sizes). A relevant local market area shall be an area geographically smaller than a market area established by the Secretary under section 1437f(c)(1) of title 42 that is identifiable as a distinct rental market area. The Secretary may rely on the appraisal to determine the relevant local market areas and prevailing rents in such local areas and any other information the Secretary determines is appropriate.</p>
<h4 class="paragraph-head">(3) Effect</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">For purposes of this subchapter, the aggregate preservation rents shall be considered to exceed the Federal cost limits under this subsection only if the aggregate preservation rents exceed the amount determined under paragraph (1) and the amount determined under paragraph (2).</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(b) Limitations on action pursuant to Federal cost limits</h4>
<h4 class="paragraph-head">(1) Housing within Federal cost limits</h4>

<h4 class="subsection-head">(a) In general</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">With respect to any eligible low-income housing for which the aggregate preservation rents determined under section 4104(b) of this title exceed the Federal cost limit, the owner shall offer the housing for sale to qualified purchasers as provided in this section.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(b) Right of first refusal to priority purchasers</h4>
<h4 class="paragraph-head">(1) Duration and required sale</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">For the 12-month period beginning upon the receipt by the Secretary of the second notice of intent under section 4106(d) of this title with respect to such housing, the owner of the housing may offer to sell and may sell the housing only to priority purchasers. If, during such period, a priority purchaser makes a bona fide offer to purchase the housing for a sale price not less than the preservation value of the housing determined under section 4103(b)(2) of this title, the Secretary shall require the owner to sell the housing pursuant to such offer.</p>
<h4 class="paragraph-head">(2) Expression of interest</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">During the period under paragraph (1), priority purchasers shall have the opportunity to submit written notice to the owner and the Secretary stating their interest in acquiring the housing. Such written notice shall be in such form and include such information as the Secretary may prescribe.</p>
<h4 class="paragraph-head">(3) Information from Secretary</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">Not later than 30 days after receipt of any notice under paragraph (2), the Secretary shall provide such purchaser with information on the assistance available from the Federal Government to facilitate a transfer and the owner shall provide such purchaser with appropriate information on the housing, as determined by the Secretary.</p>
<!-- PDFPage:1604 --><h4 class="subsection-head">(c) Right of refusal for other qualified purchasers</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">If no bona fide offer to purchase any eligible low-income housing subject to this section that meets the requirements of subsection (b) is made during the period under such subsection, during the 3-month period beginning upon the expiration of the 12-month period under subsection (b)(1), the owner of the housing may offer to sell and may sell the housing only to qualified purchasers. If, during such period, a qualified purchaser makes a bona fide offer to purchase the housing for a sale price not less than the preservation value of the housing determined under section 4103(b)(2) of this title, the Secretary shall require the owner to sell the housing pursuant to such offer.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(d) Assistance</h4>
<h4 class="paragraph-head">(1) Federal cost limit</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">Subject to the availability of amounts approved in appropriations Acts, the Secretary shall, for approvable plans of action, provide to qualified purchasers assistance under section 1437f of title 42 sufficient to produce a gross income potential equal to the amount determined by multiplying 120 percent of the prevailing rents in the relevant local market area in which the housing is located by the number of units in the project (according to appropriate unit sizes), and any other incentives authorized under section 4109(b) of this title that would have been provided to a qualified purchaser under section 4110 of this title.</p>

<h4 class="paragraph-head">(3) Securing State and local funding</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">The Secretary shall assist any qualified purchaser of such housing in securing funding and other assistance (including tax and assessment reductions) from State and local governments to facilitate a sale under this section.</p>

<h3 class="section-head">&sect;4112. Criteria for approval of plan of action involving incentives</h3>
<!-- field-end:head -->
<!-- field-start:statute -->
<h4 class="subsection-head">(a) In general</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">The Secretary may approve a plan of action for extension of the low-income affordability restrictions on any eligible low-income housing or transfer the housing to a qualified purchaser (other than a resident council) only upon finding that&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(1) due diligence has been given to ensuring that the package of incentives is, for the Federal Government, the least costly alternative that is consistent with the full achievement of the purposes of this title;&#160;<sup><a href="#4112_1_target" name="4112_1">1</a></sup></p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(2) binding commitments have been made to ensure that&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(A) the housing will be retained as housing affordable for very low-income families or persons, low-income families or persons, and moderate-income families or persons for the remaining useful life of such housing (as determined under subsection (c));</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(B) throughout such period, adequate expenditures will be made for maintenance and operation of the housing and that the project meets housing standards established by the Secretary under subsection (d), as determined by inspections conducted under such subsection by the Secretary;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(C) current tenants will not be involuntarily displaced (except for good cause);</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(D) any increase in rent contributions for current tenants will be to a level that does not exceed 30 percent of the adjusted income of the tenant or the published existing fair market rent for comparable housing established under section 1437f(c) of title 42, whichever is lower, except that the rent contributions of any tenants occupying the housing at the time of any increase may not be reduced by reason of this subparagraph (except with respect to tenants receiving section 8 [42 U.S.C. 1437f] assistance in accordance with subparagraph (E)(ii) of this paragraph);</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(E)(i) any resulting increase in rents for current tenants (except for increases made necessary by increased operating costs)&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-3em">(I) shall be phased in equally over a period of not less than 3 years, if such increase is 30 percent or more; and</p>
<p class="statutory-body-3em">(II) shall be limited to not more than 10 percent per year if such increase is more than 10 percent but less than 30 percent; and</p>
<br class="Q04" />
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(ii) assistance under section 1437f of title 42 shall be provided, to the extent available under appropriation Acts, if necessary to mitigate any adverse effect on current income-eligible very low- and low-income tenants; and&#160;<sup><a href="#4112_2_target" name="4112_2">2</a></sup></p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(F)(i) rents for units becoming available to new tenants shall be at levels approved by the Secretary that will ensure, to the extent practicable, that the units will be available and affordable to the same proportions of very low-income families or persons, low-income families or persons, and moderate-income families or persons (including families or persons whose incomes are 95 percent or more of area median income) as resided in the housing as of January 1, 1987 (based on the area median income limits established by the Secretary in February 1987), or the <!-- PDFPage:1605 -->date the plan of action is approved, whichever date results in the highest proportion of very low-income families, except that this limitation shall not prohibit a higher proportion of very low-income families from occupying the housing; and</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(ii) in approving rents under this paragraph, the Secretary shall take into account any additional incentives provided under this subchapter;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(G) future rent adjustments shall be&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-3em">(i) made by applying an annual factor (to be determined by the Secretary) to the portion of rent attributable to operating expenses for the housing and, where the owner is a priority purchaser, to the portion of rent attributable to project oversight costs; and</p>
<p class="statutory-body-3em">(ii) subject to a procedure, established by the Secretary, for owners to apply for rent increases not adequately compensated by annual adjustment under clause (i), under which the Secretary may increase rents in excess of the amount determined under clause (i) only if the Secretary determines such increases are necessary to reflect extraordinary necessary expenses of owning and maintaining the housing; and</p>
<br class="Q04" />
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(H) any savings from reductions in operating expenses due to management efficiencies shall be deposited in project reserves for replacement and the owner shall have periodic access to such reserves, to the extent the Secretary determines that the level of reserves is adequate and that the housing is maintained in accordance with the standards established under subsection (d); and</p>
<br class="Q04" />
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(3) no incentives under section 4109 of this title (other than to purchasers under section 4110 of this title) may be provided until the Secretary determines the project meets housing standards under subsection (d), except that incentives under such section and other incentives designed to correct deficiencies in the project may be provided.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(b) Implementation</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">Any agreement to maintain the low-income affordability restrictions for the remaining useful life of the housing may be made through execution of a new regulatory agreement, modifications to the existing regulatory agreement or mortgage, or, in the case of the prepayment of a mortgage or voluntary termination of mortgage insurance, a recorded instrument.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(c) Determination of remaining useful life</h4>
<h4 class="paragraph-head">(1) &quot;Remaining useful life&quot; defined</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">For purposes of this title,<sup><a href="#4112_1_target" name="4112_1">1</a></sup> the term &quot;remaining useful life&quot; means, with respect to eligible low-income housing, the period during which the physical characteristics of the housing remain in a condition suitable for occupancy, assuming normal maintenance and repairs are made and major systems and capital components are replaced as becomes necessary.</p>
<h4 class="paragraph-head">(2) Standards</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">The Secretary shall, by rule under section 553 of title 5, establish standards for determining when the useful life of an eligible low-income housing project has expired. The determination shall be made on the record after opportunity for a hearing.</p>
<h4 class="paragraph-head">(3) Owner petition</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">The Secretary shall establish a procedure under which owners of eligible low-income housing may petition the Secretary for a determination that the useful life of such housing has expired. The procedure shall not permit such a petition before the expiration of the 50-year period beginning upon the approval of a plan of action under this subchapter with respect to such housing. In making a determination pursuant to a petition under this paragraph, the Secretary shall presume that the useful life of the housing has not expired, and the owner shall have the burden of proof in establishing such expiration. The Secretary may not determine that the useful life of any housing has expired if such determination results primarily from failure to make regular and reasonable repairs and replacement, as became necessary.</p>
<h4 class="paragraph-head">(4) Tenant and community comment and appeal</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">In making a determination regarding the useful life of any housing pursuant to a petition submitted under paragraph (3), the Secretary shall provide for comment by tenants of the housing and interested persons and organizations with respect to the petition. The Secretary shall also provide the tenants and interested persons and organizations with an opportunity to appeal a determination under this subsection.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(d) Housing standards</h4>
<h4 class="paragraph-head">(1) Establishment and inspection</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">The Secretary shall, by regulation, establish standards regarding the physical condition in which any eligible low income housing project receiving incentives under this subchapter shall be maintained. The Secretary shall inspect each such project not less than annually to ensure that the project is in compliance with such standards.</p>
<h4 class="paragraph-head">(2) Sanctions</h4>
<h4 class="subparagraph-head">(A) In general</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">The Secretary shall take any action appropriate to require the owner of any housing not in compliance with such standards to bring such housing into compliance with the standards, including&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-3em">(i) directing the mortgagee, with respect to an equity take-out loan under section 1715z&ndash;6(f)&#160;<sup><a href="#4112_1_target" name="4112_1">1</a></sup> of this title, to withhold the disbursement to the owner of any escrowed loan proceeds and requiring that such proceeds be used for repair of the housing; and</p>
<p class="statutory-body-3em">(ii) reduce the amount of the annual authorized return, as determined by the Secretary, for the period ending upon a determination by the Secretary that the project is in compliance with the standards and requiring that such amounts be used for repair.</p>
<h4 class="subparagraph-head">(B) Continued compliance</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">To ensure continued compliance with the standards for a project subject to any action <!-- PDFPage:1606 -->under subparagraph (A), the Secretary may also limit access of the owner to such amounts and use of such amounts for not more than the 2-year period beginning upon the determination that the project is in compliance with the standards.</p>
<h4 class="subparagraph-head">(C) Removal of assistance</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">If, upon inspection, the Secretary determines that any eligible low income housing project has failed to comply with the standards established under this subsection for 2 consecutive years, the Secretary may take 1 or more of the following actions:</p>
<p class="statutory-body-3em">(i) Subject to availability of amounts provided in appropriations Acts, provide assistance under sections 1437f(b) and 1437f(o) of title 42 (other than project-based assistance attached to the housing) for any tenant eligible for such assistance who desires to terminate occupancy in the housing. For each unit in the housing vacated pursuant to the provision of assistance under this clause, the Secretary may, notwithstanding any other law or contract for assistance, cancel the provision of project-based assistance attached to the housing for 1 dwelling unit, if the housing is receiving such assistance.</p>
<p class="statutory-body-3em">(ii) In the case of housing for which an equity take-out loan has been made under section 1715z&ndash;6(f)&#160;<sup><a href="#4112_1_target" name="4112_1">1</a></sup> of this title, declare such loan to be in default and accelerate the maturity date of the loan.</p>
<p class="statutory-body-3em">(iii) Declare any rehabilitation loan insured or provided by the Secretary (with respect to the housing) to be in default and accelerate the maturity date of the loan.</p>
<p class="statutory-body-3em">(iv) Suspend payments under or terminate any contract for project-based rental assistance under section 1437f of title 42.</p>
<p class="statutory-body-3em">(v) Take any other action authorized by law or the project regulatory agreement to ensure that the housing will be brought into compliance with the standards established under this subsection.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(e) Distribution and residual receipts</h4>
<h4 class="paragraph-head">(1) Authority</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">After December 4, 2015, the owner of a property subject to a plan of action or use agreement pursuant to this section shall be entitled to distribute&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(A) annually, all surplus cash generated by the property, but only if the owner is in material compliance with such use agreement including compliance with prevailing physical condition standards established by the Secretary; and</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(B) notwithstanding any conflicting provision in such use agreement, any funds accumulated in a residual receipts account, but only if the owner is in material compliance with such use agreement and has completed, or set aside sufficient funds for completion of, any capital repairs identified by the most recent third party capital needs assessment.</p>
<h4 class="paragraph-head">(2) Operation of property</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">An owner that distributes any amounts pursuant to paragraph (1) shall&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(A) continue to operate the property in accordance with the affordability provisions of the use agreement for the property for the remaining useful life of the property;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(B) as required by the plan of action for the property, continue to renew or extend any project-based rental assistance contract for a term of not less than 20 years; and</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(C) if the owner has an existing multi-year project-based rental assistance contract for less than 20 years, have the option to extend the contract to a 20-year term.</p>

<h3 class="section-head">&sect;4113. Assistance for displaced tenants</h3>
<!-- field-end:head -->
<!-- field-start:statute -->
<h4 class="subsection-head">(a) Section 1437f assistance</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">Each low-income family that is displaced as a result of the prepayment of the mortgage or voluntary termination of an insurance contract on eligible low income housing shall, subject to the availability or&#160;<sup><a href="#4113_1_target" name="4113_1">1</a></sup> amounts provided under appropriations Acts, receive tenant-based assistance under section 1437f of title 42. To the extent sufficient amounts are made available under appropriations Acts, in each fiscal year the Secretary shall reserve from amounts made available under section 4124(a) of this title or, if necessary, under section 1437c(c) of title 42, such amounts as the Secretary determines are necessary to provide assistance payments for low-income families displaced during the fiscal year.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(b) Relocation assistance</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">The Secretary shall coordinate with public housing agencies to ensure that any very low- or low-income family displaced from eligible low-income housing as the result of the prepayment of the mortgage (or termination of the mortgage insurance contract) on such housing is able to acquire a suitable, affordable dwelling unit in the area of the housing from which the family is displaced. The Secretary shall require the owner of such housing to pay 50 percent of the moving expenses of each family relocated, except that such percentage shall be increased to the extent that State or local law of general applicability requires a higher payment by the owner.</p>
<!-- PDFPage:1608 --><h4 class="subsection-head">(c) Continued occupancy</h4>
<h4 class="paragraph-head">(1) In general</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">Each owner that prepays the mortgage (or terminates the mortgage insurance contract) on eligible low-income housing shall, as provided in paragraph (3), allow the tenants occupying units in such housing on the date of the submission of notice of intent under section 4102 of this title to remain in the housing for a period of 3 years, at rent levels (except for increases necessary for increased operating costs) existing at the time of prepayment.</p>
<h4 class="paragraph-head">(2) Provision of assistance by owner</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">In any case in which the Secretary requires an owner to allow tenants to occupy units under paragraph (1), an owner may fulfill the requirements of such paragraph by providing such assistance necessary for the tenant to rent a decent, safe, and sanitary unit in another project for the same period and at a rental cost to the tenant not in excess of the rental amount the tenant would have been required to pay in the housing of the owner, except that the tenant must freely agree to waive the right to occupy the unit in the owner's housing.</p>
<h4 class="paragraph-head">(3) Applicability to low-vacancy areas and special needs tenants</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">The provisions of this subsection shall apply only to&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(A) eligible low income housing located in a low-vacancy area (as such term is defined by the Secretary); and</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(B) tenants in any eligible low-income housing in any area who have special needs restricting their ability to relocate (including elderly tenants and tenants with disabilities), as determined under regulations established by the Secretary.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(d) Required acceptance of section 1437f assistance</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">An owner who prepays the mortgage (or terminates the mortgage insurance contract) on eligible low-income housing and maintains the housing for residential rental occupancy may not refuse to rent, refuse to negotiate for the rental of, or otherwise make unavailable or deny the rent of a dwelling unit in such property to any person, or discriminate against any person in the terms, conditions, or privileges of rental of a dwelling (or in the provision of services or facilities in connection therewith), because the person receives assistance under section 1437f of title 42.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(e) Regional pools</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">In providing assistance under this section, the Secretary shall allocate the assistance on a regional basis through the regional offices of the Department of Housing and Urban Development. The Secretary shall allocate assistance under this section in a manner so that the total number of assisted units in each such region available for occupancy by, and affordable to, lower income families and persons does not decrease because of the prepayment or payment of a mortgage on eligible low-income housing or the termination of an insurance contract on such housing.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(f) Enhanced voucher assistance for certain tenants</h4>
<h4 class="paragraph-head">(1) Authority</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">In lieu of benefits under subsections (b), (c), and (d), and subject to the availability of appropriated amounts, each family described in paragraph (2) shall be offered enhanced voucher assistance under section 1437f(t) of title 42.</p>
<h4 class="paragraph-head">(2) Eligible families</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">A family described in this paragraph is a family that is&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(A)(i) a low-income family; or</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(ii) a moderate-income family that is: (I) an elderly family; (II) a disabled family; or (III) residing in a low-vacancy area; and</p>

<h4 class="subsection-head">(a) In general</h4>

<p class="statutory-body-1em">(1)(A) The Secretary approves a plan of action under section 4109(a) of this title, but does not provide the assistance approved in such plan during the 15-month period beginning on the date of approval.</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(B) After the date that the housing would have been eligible for prepayment pursuant to the terms of the mortgage (notwithstanding this subchapter), the Secretary approves a plan of action under section 4110 or 4111 of this title, but does not provide the assistance approved in such plan before the earlier of (i) the expiration of the 2-month period beginning on <!-- PDFPage:1609 -->the commencement of the 1st fiscal year beginning after such approval, or (ii) the expiration of the 6-month period beginning on the date of approval.</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(C) The Secretary approves a plan of action under section 4110 or 4111 of this title for any eligible low-income housing not covered by subparagraph (B), but does not provide the assistance approved in such plan before the earlier of (i) the expiration of the 2-month period beginning on the commencement of the 1st fiscal year beginning after such approval, or (ii) the expiration of the 9-month period beginning on the date of approval.</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(2) An owner who intended to transfer the housing to a qualified purchaser under section 4110 or 4111 of this title, and fully complied with the provisions of such section, did not receive any bona fide offers from any qualified purchasers within the applicable time periods.</p>
<br class="Q04" />
<p class="statutory-body-block">In the event that the purchaser under the plan of action is unable to consummate the purchase for reasons other than the failure of the Secretary to provide incentives, an owner may terminate the low-income affordability restrictions through prepayment or voluntary termination subject to the provisions of sections 4110 and 4111 of this title.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(b) Section 1437f rental assistance</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">When providing rental assistance under section 1437f of title 42, the Secretary may enter into a contract with an owner, contingent upon the future availability of appropriations for the purpose of renewing expiring contracts for rental assistance as provided in appropriations Acts, to extend the term of such rental assistance for such additional period or periods necessary to carry out an approved plan of action. The contract and the approved plan of action shall provide that, if the Secretary is unable to extend the term of such rental assistance or is unable to develop a revised package of incentives providing benefits to the owner comparable to those received under the original approved plan of action, the Secretary, upon the request of the owner, shall take the following actions (subject to the limitations under the following paragraphs):</p>
<h4 class="paragraph-head">(1) Modification of commitments</h4>

<p class="statutory-body-block">At least 30 days before making a request under this subsection, an owner shall notify the Secretary of the owner's intention to submit the request. The Secretary shall have a period of 90 days following receipt of such notice to take action to extend the rental assistance contract and to continue the binding commitments under section 4112(a)(2) of this title.</p>

<h4 class="paragraph-head">(1) Sales to residents</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">As a condition of approval of a plan of action involving homeownership program under this subchapter, the resident council shall prepare a workable plan acceptable to the Secretary for giving all residents an opportunity to become owners, which plan shall identify&mdash;</p>

<p class="statutory-body-2em">(F) a workable schedule of sale (subject to the limitations of paragraph (8)) based on estimated tenant incomes.</p>
<h4 class="paragraph-head">(2) Approval of method of conversion and limitation on conditions of approval</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">The Secretary shall approve the method for converting the housing to homeownership, which may involve acquisition of ownership interests in, or shares representing, the units in a project under any arrangement determined by the Secretary to be appropriate, such as cooperative ownership (including limited equity cooperative ownership) and fee simple ownership (including condominium ownership). The Secretary may not require the prepayment of the mortgage on eligible low-income housing for the approval of a plan of action involving a homeownership program for the housing.</p>
<h4 class="paragraph-head">(3) Required conditions</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">The Secretary shall require that the form of homeownership impose appropriate conditions, including conditions to assure that&mdash;</p>

The remaining 50 percent of such proceeds shall be returned to the Secretary for use under section 4110 of this title, subject to availability under appropriations Acts. Such entity shall keep, and make available to the Secretary, all records necessary to calculate accurately payments due the Secretary under this paragraph.</p>

The plan shall provide for limiting the family's consideration for its interest in the property to the total of&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-3em">(i) the contribution to equity paid by the family;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-3em">(ii) the value, as determined by such means as the Secretary shall determine through regulation, of any improvements installed at the expense of the family during the family's tenure as owner; and</p>
<p class="statutory-body-3em">(iii) the appreciated value determined by an inflation allowance at a rate which may be based on a cost-of-living index, an income index, or market index as determined by the Secretary through regulation and agreed to by the purchaser and the entity that transfers ownership interests in, or shares representing, units to eligible families (or another entity specified in the approved application), at the time of initial sale, and applied against the contribution to equity.</p>
<br class="Q04" />
