<p class="statutory-body-1em">If a notice of charges served under section 4631(a) or (b) of this title specifies on the basis of particular facts and circumstances that the books and records of the regulated entity served are so incomplete or inaccurate that the Director is unable, through the normal supervisory process, to determine the financial condition of the regulated entity or the details or the purpose of any transaction or transactions that may have a material effect on the financial condition of that regulated entity, the Director may issue a temporary order requiring&mdash;</p>

<p class="statutory-body">A regulated entity, executive officer, director, or entity-affiliated party that has been served with a temporary order pursuant to this section may apply to the United States District Court for the District of Columbia within 10 days after such service for an injunction setting aside, limiting, or suspending the enforcement, operation, or effectiveness of the order pending the completion of the administrative proceedings pursuant to the notice of charges served upon the enterprise, executive officer, director, or entity-affiliated party under section 4631(a) or (b) of this title. Such court shall have jurisdiction to issue such injunction.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(e) Enforcement by Attorney General</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">In the case of violation or threatened violation of, or failure to obey, a temporary order issued pursuant to this section, the Director may bring an action in the United States District Court for the District of Columbia for an injunction to enforce such order.
