<p class="statutory-body">(a) The Congress finds that&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(1) the Nation is in a severe recession and that the sharp downturn in economic activity has driven large numbers of workers into unemployment and has reduced the incomes of many others;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(2) as a result of these adverse economic conditions the capacity of many homeowners to continue to make mortgage payments has deteriorated and may further deteriorate in the months ahead, leading to the possibility of widespread mortgage foreclosures and distress sales of homes; and</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(3) many of these homeowners could retain their homes with temporary financial assistance until economic conditions improve.</p>
<br class="Q04" />
<p class="statutory-body">(b) It is the purpose of this chapter to provide a standby authority which will prevent widespread mortgage foreclosures and distress sales of homes resulting from the temporary loss of employment and income through a program of emergency loans and advances and emergency mortgage relief payments to homeowners to defray mortgage expenses.</p>

<!-- field-end:head -->
<!-- field-start:statute -->
<h4 class="subsection-head">(a) Form of assistance</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">Assistance under this chapter with respect to a mortgage which meets the requirements of section 2702 of this title may be provided in the form of emergency mortgage relief loans and advances of credit insured pursuant to section 2704 of this title or in the form of emergency mortgage relief payments made by the Secretary pursuant to section 2705 of this title.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(b) Amount of assistance</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">Assistance under this chapter on behalf of a homeowner may be made available in an amount up to the amount of the principal, interest, taxes, ground rents, hazard insurance, and mortgage insurance premiums due under the homeowner's mortgage. The amount of assistance provided to a homeowner under this chapter shall be an amount that the Secretary determines is reasonably necessary to supplement such amount as the homeowner is capable of contributing toward such mortgage payment, except that the aggregate amount of such assistance provided for any homeowner shall not exceed $50,000.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(c) Monthly payments; extension of time; report of increase in income</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">Monthly payments may be provided under this chapter either with the proceeds of an insured loan or advance of credit or with emergency mortgage relief payments for up to twelve months, and, in accordance with criteria prescribed by the Secretary, such monthly payments may be extended once for up to twelve additional months. A mortgagor receiving the benefit of mortgage relief assistance pursuant to this chapter shall be required, in accordance with criteria prescribed by the Secretary, to report any increase in income which will permit a reduction or termination of such assistance during this period.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(d) Conditions and terms of repayment; interest rate</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">Emergency loans or advances of credit made and insured under section 2704 of this title, and emergency mortgage relief payments made under section 2705 of this title, shall be repayable by the homeowner upon such terms and conditions as the Secretary shall prescribe, except that (1) the rate of interest on any loan or advance of credit insured under this chapter shall be fixed for the life of the loan or advance of credit and shall not exceed the rate of interest that is generally charged for mortgages on single-family housing insured by the Secretary of Housing and Urban Development under title II of the National Housing Act [12 U.S.C. 1707 et seq.] at the time such loan or advance of credit is made, and (2) no interest shall be charged on interest which is deferred on a loan or advance of credit made under this chapter. In establishing rates, terms and conditions for loans or advances of credit made under this chapter, the Secretary shall take into account a homeowner's ability to repay such loan or advance of credit.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(e) Deferral of commencement of repayment; security for repayment</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">The Secretary may provide for the deferral of the commencement of the repayment of a loan or advance insured under section 2704 of this title or emergency mortgage relief payments made under section 2705 of this title until one year following the date of the last disbursement of the proceeds of the loan or advance or payments or for such longer period as the Secretary determines would further the purpose of this chapter. Any eligible homeowner who receives a grant or an advance of credit under this chapter may repay the loan in full, without penalty, by lump sum or by installment payments at any time before the loan becomes due and payable. The Secretary shall by regulation require such security for the repayment of insured loans or advances of credit or emergency mortgage relief payments as he deems appropriate and may require that such repayment be secured by a lien on the mortgaged property.</p>

<p class="statutory-body">The Secretary is authorized and empowered to waive compliance with any rule or regulation prescribed by the Secretary for the purposes of this section if, in the Secretary's judgment, the enforcement of such rule or regulation would impose an injustice upon an insured lending institution which has substantially complied with such regulations in good faith. Any payment for loss made to an insured financial institution under this section shall be final and incontestable after two years from the date the claim was certified for payment by the Secretary, in the absence of fraud or misrepresentation on the part of such institution unless a demand for repurchase of the obligation shall have been made on behalf of the United States prior to the expiration of such two-year period.
