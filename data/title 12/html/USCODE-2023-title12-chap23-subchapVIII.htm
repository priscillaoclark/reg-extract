<p class="statutory-body-2em">(A) shall guarantee the timely payment of principal and interest on the securities issued by a certified facility that represents interests solely in, or obligations fully backed by, any pool consisting solely of qualified loans which meet the applicable standards established under section 2279aa&ndash;8 of this title and which are held by such facility; and</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(B) may issue a security, guaranteed as to the timely payment of principal and interest, that represents an interest solely in, or an obligation fully backed by, a pool consisting of qualified loans that&mdash;</p>

<!-- PDFPage:1421 --><p class="statutory-body-3em">(ii) have been purchased and held by the Corporation.</p>
<h4 class="paragraph-head">(2) Inability of facility to pay</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">If the facility is unable to make any payment of principal or interest on any security for which a guarantee has been provided by the Corporation under paragraph (1), the Corporation shall make such payment as and when due in cash, and on such payment shall be subrogated fully to the rights satisfied by such payment.</p>
<h4 class="paragraph-head">(3) Power of Corporation</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">Notwithstanding any other provision of law, the Corporation is empowered, in connection with any guarantee under this subsection, whether before or after any default, to provide by contract with the facility for the extinguishment, on default by the facility, of any redemption, equitable, legal, or other right, title, or interest of the facility in any mortgage or mortgages constituting the pool against which the guaranteed securities are issued. With respect to any issue of guaranteed securities, in the event of default and pursuant otherwise to the terms of the contract, the mortgages that constitute such pool shall become the absolute property of the Corporation subject only to the unsatisfied rights of the holders of the securities based on and backed by such pool.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(b) Other responsibilities of and limitations on certified facilities</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">As a condition for providing any guarantees under this section for securities issued by a certified facility that represent interests in, or obligations backed by, any pool of qualified loans, the Corporation shall require such facility to agree to comply with the following requirements:</p>

<p class="statutory-body-2em">(A) first, to reduce the amount of any principal outstanding on any obligation of the Corporation that was purchased by the Secretary of the Treasury under section 2279aa&ndash;13 of this title to the extent the proceeds of such obligation were used to make guarantees in connection with such securities; and</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(B) second, to reimburse the Corporation for any such guarantee payments.</p>

Securities issued under this section shall have maturities and bear rates of interest as determined by the Corporation.</p>
<h4 class="paragraph-head">(2) Issuance of debt obligations</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">The Corporation (and affiliates) may issue debt obligations solely for the purpose of obtaining amounts for the purchase of any securities under paragraph (1), for the purchase of qualified loans (as defined in section 2279aa of this title), and for maintaining reasonable amounts for business operations (including adequate liquidity) relating to activities under this subsection.</p>
<h4 class="paragraph-head">(3) Terms and limitations</h4>

<h3 class="section-head">&sect;2279bb&ndash;1. Risk-based capital levels</h3>
<!-- field-end:head -->
<!-- field-start:statute -->
<h4 class="subsection-head">(a) Risk-based capital test</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">The Director of the Office of Secondary Market Oversight shall, by regulation, establish a risk-based capital test under this section for the Corporation. When applied to the Corporation, the risk-based capital test shall determine the amount of regulatory capital for the Corporation that is sufficient for the Corporation to maintain positive capital during a 10-year period in which both of the following circumstances occur:</p>
<h4 class="paragraph-head">(1) Credit risk</h4>
<h4 class="subparagraph-head">(A) In general</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">With respect to securities representing an interest in, or obligations backed by, a pool of qualified loans owned or guaranteed by the Corporation and other obligations of the Corporation, losses on the underlying qualified loans occur throughout the United States at a rate of default and severity (based on any measurements of default reasonably related to prevailing industry practice in determining capital adequacy) reasonably related to the rate and severity that occurred in contiguous areas of the United States containing an aggregate of not less than 5 percent of the total population of the United States that, for a period of not less than 2 years (as established by the Director), experienced the highest rates of default and severity of agricultural mortgage losses, in <!-- PDFPage:1429 -->comparison with such rates of default and severity of agricultural mortgage losses in other such areas for any period of such duration, as determined by the Director.</p>
<h4 class="subparagraph-head">(B) Rural utility loans</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">With respect to securities representing an interest in, or obligation backed by, a pool of qualified loans described in section 2279aa(7)(C) of this title owned or guaranteed by the Corporation, losses occur at a rate of default and severity reasonably related to risks in electric and telephone facility loans (as applicable), as determined by the Director.</p>
<h4 class="paragraph-head">(2) Interest rate risk</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">Interest rates on Treasury obligations of varying terms increase or decrease over the first 12 months of such 10-year period by not more than the lesser of (A) 50 percent (with respect to the average interest rates on such obligations during the 12-month period preceding the 10-year period), or (B) 600 basis points, and remain at such level for the remainder of the period. This paragraph may not be construed to require the Director to determine interest rate risk under this paragraph based on the interest rates for various long-term and short-term obligations all increasing or all decreasing concurrently.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(b) Considerations</h4>
<h4 class="paragraph-head">(1) Establishment of test</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">In establishing the risk-based capital test under subsection (a)&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(A) the Director shall take into account appropriate distinctions based on various types of agricultural mortgage products, varying terms of Treasury obligations, and any other factors the Director considers appropriate;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(B) the Director shall conform loan data used in determining credit risk to the minimum geographic and commodity diversification standards applicable to pools of qualified loans eligible for guarantee;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(C) the Director may take into account retained subordinated participating interests under section 2279aa&ndash;6(b)(2) of this title (as in effect before February 10, 1996);</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(D) the Director may take into account other methods or tests to determine credit risk developed by the Corporation before December 13, 1991; and</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(E) the Director shall consider any other information submitted by the Corporation in writing during the 180-day period beginning on December 13, 1991.</p>
<h4 class="paragraph-head">(2) Revising test</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">Upon the expiration of the 8-year period beginning on December 13, 1991, the Director shall examine the risk-based capital test under subsection (a) and may revise the test. In making examinations and revisions under this paragraph, the Director shall take into account that, before December 13, 1991, the Corporation has not issued guarantees for pools of qualified loans. To the extent that the revision of the risk-based capital test causes a change in the classification of the Corporation within the enforcement levels established under section 2279bb&ndash;4 of this title, the Director shall waive the applicability of any additional enforcement actions available because of such change for a reasonable period of time, to permit the Corporation to increase the amount of regulatory capital of the Corporation accordingly.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(c) Risk-based capital level</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">For purposes of this part, the risk-based capital level for the Corporation shall be equal to the sum of the following amounts:</p>
<h4 class="paragraph-head">(1) Credit and interest rate risk</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">The amount of regulatory capital determined by applying the risk-based capital test under subsection (a) to the Corporation, adjusted to account for foreign exchange risk.</p>
<h4 class="paragraph-head">(2) Management and operations risk</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">To provide for management and operations risk, 30 percent of the amount of regulatory capital determined by applying the risk-based capital test under subsection (a) to the Corporation.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(d) Specified contents</h4>
<h4 class="paragraph-head">(1) In general</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">The regulations establishing the risk-based capital test under this section shall&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(A) be issued by the Director for public comment in the form of a notice of proposed rulemaking, to be first published after the expiration of the period referred to in subsection (a); and</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(B) contain specific requirements, definitions, methods, variables, and parameters used under the risk-based capital test and in implementing the test (such as loan loss severity, float income, loan-to-value ratios, taxes, yield curve slopes, default experience, prepayment rates, and performance of pools of qualified loans).</p>
<h4 class="paragraph-head">(2) Specificity</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">The regulations referred to in paragraph (1) shall be sufficiently specific to permit an individual other than the Director to apply the test in the same manner as the Director.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(e) Availability of model</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">The Director shall make copies of the statistical model or models used to implement the risk-based capital test under this section available for public acquisition and may charge a reasonable fee for such copies.</p>
