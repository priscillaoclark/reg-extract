<p class="statutory-body-1em">The term &quot;non-IBOR loan&quot; means any loan that, by its terms, does not use in any way LIBOR, any tenor of non-U.S. dollar currency rates formerly known as the London interbank offered rate as administered by ICE Benchmark Administration Limited (or any predecessor or successor administrator thereof), and any other interbank offered rates that are expected to cease, as a benchmark.</p>
