Such order may, in addition to requiring a person to cease and desist from committing or causing a violation, require such person to comply, or to take steps to effect compliance, with such provision or regulation, upon such terms and conditions and within such time as the Director may specify in such order. Any such order may, as the Director deems appropriate, require future compliance or steps to effect future compliance, either permanently or for such period of time as the Director may specify, with such provision or regulation with respect to any loan originator.</p>

Such an order shall be entered only after notice and opportunity for a hearing, unless the Director determines that notice and hearing prior to entry would be impracticable or contrary to the public interest.

A respondent served with a temporary cease and desist order entered without a prior hearing before the Director may not apply to the court except after hearing and decision by the Director on the respondent's application under subparagraph (A).</p>
