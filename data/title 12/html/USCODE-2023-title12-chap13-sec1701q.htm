<h4 class="subsection-head">(a) Purpose</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">The purpose of this section is to enable elderly persons to live with dignity and independence by expanding the supply of supportive housing that&mdash;</p>

<p class="statutory-body-1em">(2) provides a range of services that are tailored to the needs of elderly persons occupying such housing.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(b) General authority</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">The Secretary is authorized to provide assistance to private nonprofit organizations and consumer cooperatives to expand the supply of supportive housing for the elderly. Such assistance shall be provided as (1) capital advances in accordance with subsection (c)(1), and (2) contracts for project rental assistance in accordance with subsection (c)(2). Such assistance may be used to finance the construction, reconstruction, or moderate or substantial rehabilitation of a structure or a portion of a structure, or the acquisition of a structure, to be used as supportive housing for the elderly in accordance with this section. Assistance may also cover the cost of real property acquisition, site improvement, conversion, demolition, relocation, and other expenses that the Secretary determines are necessary to expand the supply of supportive housing for the elderly.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(c) Forms of assistance</h4>
<h4 class="paragraph-head">(1) Capital advances</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">A capital advance provided under this section shall bear no interest and its repayment shall not be required so long as the housing remains available for very low-income elderly persons in accordance with this section.

<h4 class="paragraph-head">(2) Project rental assistance</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">Contracts for project rental assistance shall obligate the Secretary to make monthly payments to cover any part of the costs attributed to units occupied (or, as approved by the Secretary, held for occupancy) by very low-income elderly persons that is not met from project income. The annual contract amount for any project shall not exceed the sum of the initial annual project rentals for all units so occupied and any initial utility allowances for such units, as approved by the Secretary. Any contract amounts not used by a project in any year shall remain available to the project until the expiration of the contract. The Secretary may adjust the annual contract amount if the sum of the project income and the amount of assistance payments available under this paragraph are inadequate to provide for reasonable project costs.</p>
<h4 class="paragraph-head">(3) Tenant rent contribution</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">A very low-income person shall pay as rent for a dwelling unit assisted under this section the highest of the following amounts, rounded to the nearest dollar: (A) 30 percent of the person's adjusted monthly income, (B) 10 percent of the person's monthly income, or (C) if the person is receiving payments for welfare assistance from a public agency and a part of such payments, adjusted in accordance with the person's actual housing costs, is specifically designated by such agency to meet the person's housing costs, the portion of such payments which is so designated.</p>

Such percentage shall be increased to 75 percent for owners which add energy efficiency features which&mdash;</p>

<p class="note-body-1em">&quot;(2) has determined that the owner of the project has provided the tenants with an opportunity to comment on the owner's request for approval of a prepayment, including on the description of any anticipated rehabilitation or other use of the proceeds from the transaction, and its impacts on project rents, tenant contributions, or the affordability restrictions for the project, and that the owner has responded to such comments in writing.</p>

<p class="note-body">Pub. L. 100&ndash;242, title I, &sect;162(a), Feb. 5, 1988, 101 Stat. 1856, provided that:</p>
<p class="note-body">&quot;(1) The Congress finds that&mdash;</p>
<p class="note-body-1em">&quot;(A) housing for nonelderly handicapped families is assisted under section 202 of the Housing Act of 1959 [12 U.S.C. 1701q] and section 8 of the United States Housing Act of 1937 [42 U.S.C. 1437f];</p>
<p class="note-body-1em">&quot;(B) the housing programs under such sections are designed and implemented primarily to assist rental housing for elderly and nonelderly families and are often inappropriate for dealing with the specialized needs of the physically impaired, the developmentally disabled, and the chronically mentally ill;</p>
<p class="note-body-1em">&quot;(C) the development of housing for nonelderly handicapped families under such programs is often more expensive than necessary, thereby reducing the number of such families that can be assisted with available funds;</p>
<p class="note-body-1em">&quot;(D) the program under section 202 of the Housing Act of 1959 can continue to provide direct loans to finance group residences and independent apartments for nonelderly handicapped families, but can be made more efficient and less costly by the adoption of standards and procedures applicable only to housing for such families;</p>
<p class="note-body-1em">&quot;(E) the cost containment policies currently being implemented in the development of small group homes (i) do not adequately reflect the necessity for building designs to meet the needs of the designated residents; and (ii) do not recognize necessary State and local standards for the operation of such homes;</p>
<p class="note-body-1em">&quot;(F) the use of the program under section 8 of the United States Housing Act of 1937 to assist rentals for housing for nonelderly handicapped families is time consuming and unnecessarily costly and, in some areas of the Nation, prevents the development of such housing;</p>
<p class="note-body-1em">&quot;(G) the use of the program under section 8 of the United States Housing Act of 1937 to assist rentals for housing for nonelderly handicapped families should be replaced by a more appropriate subsidy mechanism;</p>
<p class="note-body-1em">&quot;(H) both elderly and handicapped housing projects assisted under section 202 of the Housing Act of 1959 will benefit from an increased emphasis on supportive services and a greater use of State and local funds; and</p>
<p class="note-body-1em">&quot;(I) an improved program for nonelderly handicapped families will assist in providing shelter and supportive services for mentally ill persons who might otherwise be homeless.</p>
<p class="note-body">&quot;(2) The purpose of this section is to improve the direct loan program under section 202 of the Housing Act of 1959 to ensure that such program meets the special housing and related needs of nonelderly handicapped families.&quot;</p>
