<p class="statutory-body-1em">(3) as to mortgages meeting the requirements of this section which are insured or initially endorsed for insurance on or after June 30, 1961, notwithstanding the provisions of paragraphs (1) and (2) of this subsection, the Secretary in his discretion, in accordance with such regulations as he may prescribe, may make payments pursuant to such paragraphs in cash or in debentures (as provided in the mortgage insurance contract), or may acquire a mortgage loan that is in default and the security therefor upon payment to the mortgagee in cash or in debentures (as provided in the mortgage insurance contract) of a total amount equal to the unpaid principal balance of the loan plus any accrued interest and any advances approved by the Secretary and made previously by the mortgagee under the provisions of the mortgage, and after the acquisition of any such mortgage by the Secretary the mortgagee shall have no further rights, liabilities, or obligations with respect to the loan or the security for the loan. The appropriate provisions of sections 1710 and 1713 of this title relating to the issuance of debentures shall apply with respect to debentures issued under this paragraph, and the appropriate provisions of sections 1710 and 1713 of this title relating to the rights, liabilities, and obligations of a mortgagee shall apply with respect to the Secretary when he has acquired an insured mortgage under this paragraph, in accordance with and subject to regulations (modifying such provisions to the extent necessary to render their application for such purposes appropriate and effective) which shall be prescribed by the Secretary, except that as applied to mortgages so acquired (A) all references in section 1710 of this title to the Mutual Mortgage Insurance Fund or the Fund shall be construed to refer to the General Insurance Fund, and (B) all references in section 1710 of this title to section 1709 of this title shall be construed to refer to this section.

Upon the assignment, transfer, and delivery of the credit instrument and the mortgage to the Association, the mortgage insurance contract shall terminate and the mortgagee shall receive insurance benefits as provided in subparagraph (A). The Association is authorized to accept such loan documents in its own name and to hold, service, and sell such loans as agent for the Secretary. The mortgagor's obligation to pay a service charge in lieu of a mortgage insurance premium shall continue as long as the mortgage is held by the Association or by the Secretary.

<h4 class="note-head">Preservation of Low-Income Housing</h4>
<p class="note-body">The Emergency Low Income Housing Preservation Act of 1987, consisting of title II of Pub. L. 100&ndash;242, Feb. 5, 1988, 101 Stat. 1877, amended the National Housing Act, the United States Housing Act of 1937, and the Housing Act of 1949, and enacted provisions formerly set out as a note under this section.

L. 100&ndash;242, as amended by Pub. L. 100&ndash;628, title X, &sect;&sect;1021&ndash;1027, Nov. 7, 1988, 102 Stat. 3270, 3271; Pub. L. 101&ndash;235, title II, &sect;&sect;201, 202(a)&ndash;(c), 203(b), Dec. 15, 1989, 103 Stat. 2037, 2038; Pub. L. 101&ndash;402, &sect;1, Oct. 1, 1990, 104 Stat. 866; Pub. L. 101&ndash;494, &sect;&sect;1(c), 2(a), Oct. 31, 1990, 104 Stat. 1185, which set up a temporary program for the prepayment of mortgages on low income housing insured under the National Housing Act that terminated on the date of enactment of the Cranston-Gonzalez National Affordable Housing Act (Nov. 28, 1990). The Cranston-Gonzalez National Affordable Housing Act [Pub. L. 101&ndash;625] amended subtitles A and B of title II of Pub. L. 100&ndash;242 generally, changing the name of title II of Pub. L. 100&ndash;242 to the &quot;Low-Income Housing Preservation and Resident Homeownership Act of 1990&quot;. As amended, subtitles A and B of title II are classified generally to subchapter I (&sect;4101 et seq.) of chapter 42 of this title. Prior to the general revision by Pub. L. 101&ndash;625, subtitles A and B of title II read as follows:</p>
<h4 class="note-head">&quot;subtitle a&mdash;general provisions</h4>
<h4 class="note-sub-head">&quot;SEC. 201. SHORT TITLE.</h4>
<p class="note-body">&quot;This title [amending sections 1715z&ndash;6 and 1715z&ndash;15 of this title and sections 1437f, 1472, 1485, and 1487 of Title 42, The Public Health and Welfare] may be cited as the &apos;Emergency Low Income Housing Preservation Act of 1987&apos;.</p>
<h4 class="note-sub-head">&quot;SEC. 202. FINDINGS AND PURPOSE.</h4>
<p class="note-body">&quot;(a) <cap-smallcap>Findings</cap-smallcap>.&mdash;The Congress finds that&mdash;</p>
<p class="note-body-1em">&quot;(1) in the next 15 years, more than 330,000 low income housing units insured or assisted under sections 221(d)(3) and 236 of the National Housing Act [12 U.S.C. 1715l(d)(3), 1715z&ndash;1] could be lost as a result of the termination of low income affordability restrictions;</p>
<p class="note-body-1em">&quot;(2) in the next decade, more than 465,000 low income housing units produced with assistance under section 8 of the United States Housing Act of 1937 [42 U.S.C. 1437f] could be lost as a result of the expiration of the rental assistance contracts;</p>
<p class="note-body-1em">&quot;(3) some 150,000 units of rural low income housing financed under section 515 of the Housing Act of 1949 [42 U.S.C. 1485] are threatened with loss as a result of the prepayment of mortgages by owners;</p>
<!-- PDFPage:621 --><p class="note-body-1em">&quot;(4) the loss of this privately owned and federally assisted housing, which would occur in a period of sharply rising rents on unassisted housing and extremely low production of additional low rent housing, would inflict unacceptable harm on current tenants and would precipitate a grave national crisis in the supply of low income housing that was neither anticipated nor intended when contracts for these units were entered into;</p>
<p class="note-body-1em">&quot;(5) the loss of this affordable housing, to encourage the production of which the public has provided substantial benefits over past years, would irreparably damage hard-won progress toward such important and long-established national objectives as&mdash;</p>
<p class="note-body-2em">&quot;(A) providing a more adequate supply of decent, safe, and sanitary housing that is affordable to low income Americans;</p>
<p class="note-body-2em">&quot;(B) increasing the supply of housing affordable to low income Americans that is accessible to employment opportunities; and</p>
<p class="note-body-2em">&quot;(C) expanding housing opportunities for all Americans, particularly members of disadvantaged minorities;</p>
<p class="note-body-1em">&quot;(6) the provision of an adequate supply of low income housing has depended and will continue to depend upon a strong, long-term partnership between the public and private sectors that accommodates a fair return on investment;</p>
<p class="note-body-1em">&quot;(7) recent reductions in Federal housing assistance and tax benefits related to low income housing have increased the incentives for private industry to withdraw from the production and management of low income housing;</p>
<p class="note-body-1em">&quot;(8) efforts to retain this housing must take account of specific financial and market conditions that differ markedly from project to project;</p>
<p class="note-body-1em">&quot;(9) a major review of alternative responses to this threatened loss of affordable housing is now being undertaken by numerous private sector task forces as well as State and local organizations; and</p>
<p class="note-body-1em">&quot;(10) until the Congress can act on recommendations that will emerge from this review, interim measures are needed to avoid the irreplaceable loss of low income housing and irrevocable displacement of current tenants.</p>
<p class="note-body">&quot;(b) <cap-smallcap>Purpose</cap-smallcap>.&mdash;It is the purpose of this title&mdash;</p>
<p class="note-body-1em">&quot;(1) to preserve and retain to the maximum extent practicable as housing affordable to low income families or persons those privately owned dwelling units that were produced for such purpose with Federal assistance;</p>
<p class="note-body-1em">&quot;(2) to minimize the involuntary displacement of tenants currently residing in such housing; and</p>
<p class="note-body-1em">&quot;(3) to continue the partnership between all levels of government and the private sector in the production and operation of housing that is affordable to low income Americans.</p>
<h4 class="note-sub-head">&quot;SEC. 203. TERMINATION OF CERTAIN PROVISIONS.</h4>
<p class="note-body">&quot;(a) <cap-smallcap>In General</cap-smallcap>.&mdash;Effective on November 30, 1990, or the date of enactment of the Cranston-Gonzalez National Affordable Housing Act [Nov. 28, 1990], whichever is earlier&mdash;</p>

<p class="note-body-1em">&quot;(1) implementation of the plan of action will not materially increase economic hardship for current tenants (and will not in any event result in (A) a monthly rental payment by a current tenant that exceeds 30 percent of the monthly adjusted income of the tenant or an increase in the monthly rental payment in any year that exceeds 10 percent (whichever is lower), or (B) in the case of a current tenant who already pays more than such percentage, an increase in the monthly rental payment in any year that exceeds the increase in the Consumer Price Index or 10 percent (whichever is lower)) or involuntarily displace current tenants (except for good cause) where comparable and affordable housing is not readily available, determined without regard to the availability of Federal housing assistance that would address any such hardship or involuntary displacement; and</p>

<p class="note-body-1em">&quot;(B) the plan has been approved by the appropriate State agency and any appropriate local government agency for the jurisdiction within which the housing is located as being in accordance with a State strategy approved by the Secretary under section 226.</p>
<p class="note-body">&quot;(b) <cap-smallcap>Plan of Action Including Incentives</cap-smallcap>.&mdash;The Secretary may approve a plan of action that includes incentives only upon finding that&mdash;</p>

<p class="note-body-2em">&quot;(A) the housing will be retained as housing affordable for very low-income families or persons, lower income families or persons, and moderate income families or persons for the remaining term of the mortgage;</p>
