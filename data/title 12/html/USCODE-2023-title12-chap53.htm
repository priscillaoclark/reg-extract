<h3 class="section-head">&sect;5325. Enhanced supervision and prudential standards for nonbank financial companies supervised by the Board of Governors and certain bank holding companies</h3>
<!-- field-end:head -->
<!-- field-start:statute -->
<h4 class="subsection-head">(a) In general</h4>
<h4 class="paragraph-head">(1) Purpose</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">In order to prevent or mitigate risks to the financial stability of the United States that could arise from the material financial distress, failure, or ongoing activities of large, interconnected financial institutions, the Council may make recommendations to the Board of Governors concerning the establishment and refinement of prudential standards and reporting and disclosure requirements applicable to nonbank financial companies supervised by the Board of Governors and large, interconnected bank holding companies, that&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(A) are more stringent than those applicable to other nonbank financial companies and bank holding companies that do not present similar risks to the financial stability of the United States; and</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(B) increase in stringency, based on the considerations identified in subsection (b)(3).</p>
<h4 class="paragraph-head">(2) Recommended application of required standards</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">In making recommendations under this section, the Council may&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(A) differentiate among companies that are subject to heightened standards on an individual basis or by category, taking into consideration their capital structure, riskiness, complexity, financial activities (including the financial activities of their subsidiaries), size, and any other risk-related <!-- PDFPage:1843 -->factors that the Council deems appropriate; or</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(B) recommend an asset threshold that is higher than the applicable threshold for the application of any standard described in subsections (c) through (g).</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(b) Development of prudential standards</h4>
<h4 class="paragraph-head">(1) In general</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">The recommendations of the Council under subsection (a) may include&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(A) risk-based capital requirements;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(B) leverage limits;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(C) liquidity requirements;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(D) resolution plan and credit exposure report requirements;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(E) concentration limits;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(F) a contingent capital requirement;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(G) enhanced public disclosures;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(H) short-term debt limits; and</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(I) overall risk management requirements.</p>
<h4 class="paragraph-head">(2) Prudential standards for foreign financial companies</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">In making recommendations concerning the standards set forth in paragraph (1) that would apply to foreign nonbank financial companies supervised by the Board of Governors or foreign-based bank holding companies, the Council shall&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(A) give due regard to the principle of national treatment and equality of competitive opportunity; and</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(B) take into account the extent to which the foreign nonbank financial company or foreign-based bank holding company is subject on a consolidated basis to home country standards that are comparable to those applied to financial companies in the United States.</p>
<h4 class="paragraph-head">(3) Considerations</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">In making recommendations concerning prudential standards under paragraph (1), the Council shall&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(A) take into account differences among nonbank financial companies supervised by the Board of Governors and bank holding companies described in subsection (a), based on&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-3em">(i) the factors described in subsections (a) and (b) of section 5323 of this title;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-3em">(ii) whether the company owns an insured depository institution;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-3em">(iii) nonfinancial activities and affiliations of the company; and</p>
<p class="statutory-body-3em">(iv) any other factors that the Council determines appropriate;</p>
<br class="Q04" />
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(B) to the extent possible, ensure that small changes in the factors listed in subsections (a) and (b) of section 5323 of this title would not result in sharp, discontinuous changes in the prudential standards established under section 5365 of this title; and</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(C) adapt its recommendations as appropriate in light of any predominant line of business of such company, including assets under management or other activities for which particular standards may not be appropriate.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(c) Contingent capital</h4>
<h4 class="paragraph-head">(1) Study required</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">The Council shall conduct a study of the feasibility, benefits, costs, and structure of a contingent capital requirement for nonbank financial companies supervised by the Board of Governors and bank holding companies described in subsection (a), which study shall include&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(A) an evaluation of the degree to which such requirement would enhance the safety and soundness of companies subject to the requirement, promote the financial stability of the United States, and reduce risks to United States taxpayers;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(B) an evaluation of the characteristics and amounts of contingent capital that should be required;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(C) an analysis of potential prudential standards that should be used to determine whether the contingent capital of a company would be converted to equity in times of financial stress;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(D) an evaluation of the costs to companies, the effects on the structure and operation of credit and other financial markets, and other economic effects of requiring contingent capital;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(E) an evaluation of the effects of such requirement on the international competitiveness of companies subject to the requirement and the prospects for international coordination in establishing such requirement; and</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(F) recommendations for implementing regulations.</p>
<h4 class="paragraph-head">(2) Report</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">The Council shall submit a report to Congress regarding the study required by paragraph (1) not later than 2 years after July 21, 2010.</p>
<h4 class="paragraph-head">(3) Recommendations</h4>
<h4 class="subparagraph-head">(A) In general</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">Subsequent to submitting a report to Congress under paragraph (2), the Council may make recommendations to the Board of Governors to require any nonbank financial company supervised by the Board of Governors and any bank holding company described in subsection (a) to maintain a minimum amount of contingent capital that is convertible to equity in times of financial stress.</p>
<h4 class="subparagraph-head">(B) Factors to consider</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">In making recommendations under this subsection, the Council shall consider&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-3em">(i) an appropriate transition period for implementation of a conversion under this subsection;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-3em">(ii) the factors described in subsection (b)(3);</p>
<p class="statutory-body-3em">(iii) capital requirements applicable to a nonbank financial company supervised by the Board of Governors or a bank holding company described in subsection (a), and subsidiaries thereof;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-3em">(iv) results of the study required by paragraph (1); and</p>
<!-- PDFPage:1844 --><p class="statutory-body-3em">(v) any other factor that the Council deems appropriate.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(d) Resolution plan and credit exposure reports</h4>
<h4 class="paragraph-head">(1) Resolution plan</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">The Council may make recommendations to the Board of Governors concerning the requirement that each nonbank financial company supervised by the Board of Governors and each bank holding company described in subsection (a) report periodically to the Council, the Board of Governors, and the Corporation, the plan of such company for rapid and orderly resolution in the event of material financial distress or failure.</p>
<h4 class="paragraph-head">(2) Credit exposure report</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">The Council may make recommendations to the Board of Governors concerning the advisability of requiring each nonbank financial company supervised by the Board of Governors and bank holding company described in subsection (a) to report periodically to the Council, the Board of Governors, and the Corporation on&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(A) the nature and extent to which the company has credit exposure to other significant nonbank financial companies and significant bank holding companies; and</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(B) the nature and extent to which other such significant nonbank financial companies and significant bank holding companies have credit exposure to that company.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(e) Concentration limits</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">In order to limit the risks that the failure of any individual company could pose to nonbank financial companies supervised by the Board of Governors or bank holding companies described in subsection (a), the Council may make recommendations to the Board of Governors to prescribe standards to limit such risks, as set forth in section 5365 of this title.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(f) Enhanced public disclosures</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">The Council may make recommendations to the Board of Governors to require periodic public disclosures by bank holding companies described in subsection (a) and by nonbank financial companies supervised by the Board of Governors, in order to support market evaluation of the risk profile, capital adequacy, and risk management capabilities thereof.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(g) Short-term debt limits</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">The Council may make recommendations to the Board of Governors to require short-term debt limits to mitigate the risks that an over-accumulation of such debt could pose to bank holding companies described in subsection (a), nonbank financial companies supervised by the Board of Governors, or the financial system.</p>

<p class="statutory-body">This section shall apply to&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(1) any entity that&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(A) was a bank holding company having total consolidated assets equal to or greater than $50,000,000,000 as of January 1, 2010; and</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(B) received financial assistance under or participated in the Capital Purchase Program established under the Troubled Asset Relief Program authorized by the Emergency Economic Stabilization Act of 2008 [12 U.S.C. 5201 et seq.]; and</p>
<br class="Q04" />
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(2) any successor entity (as defined by the Board of Governors, in consultation with the Council) to an entity described in paragraph (1).</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(b) Treatment</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">If an entity described in subsection (a) ceases to be a bank holding company at any time after January 1, 2010, then such entity shall be treated as a nonbank financial company supervised by the Board of Governors, as if the Council had made a determination under section 5323 of this title with respect to that entity.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(c) Appeal</h4>
<h4 class="paragraph-head">(1) Request for hearing</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">An entity may request, in writing, an opportunity for a written or oral hearing before the Council to appeal its treatment as a nonbank financial company supervised by the Board of Governors in accordance with this section. Upon receipt of the request, the Council shall fix a time (not later than 30 days after the date of receipt of the request) and place at which such entity may appear, personally or through counsel, to submit written materials (or, at the sole discretion of the Council, oral testimony and oral argument).</p>
<h4 class="paragraph-head">(2) Decision</h4>
<h4 class="subparagraph-head">(A) Proposed decision</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">A Council decision to grant an appeal under this subsection shall be made by a vote of not fewer than 2/3 of the voting members then serving, including an affirmative vote by the Chairperson.

<h4 class="subparagraph-head">(B) Notice of final decision</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">The Council shall notify the subject entity of the final decision of the Council regarding an appeal under paragraph (1), which notice shall contain a statement of the basis for the final decision of the Council, not later than 60 days after the later of&mdash;</p>

<p class="statutory-body-3em">(ii) if, not later than 1 year after the date of submission of the report under subparagraph (A), the Committee on Banking, Housing, and Urban Affairs of the Senate or the Committee on Financial Services of the House of Representatives holds one or more hearings regarding such report, the date of the last such hearing.</p>
<h4 class="subparagraph-head">(C) Considerations</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">In making a decision regarding an appeal under paragraph (1), the Council shall consider whether the company meets the standards under section 5323(a) or 5323(b) of this title, as applicable, and the definition of the term &quot;nonbank financial company&quot; under section 5311 of this title. The decision of the Council shall be final, subject to the review under paragraph (3).</p>
<h4 class="paragraph-head">(3) Review</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">If the Council denies an appeal under this subsection, the Council shall, not less frequently than annually, review and reevaluate the decision.</p>

<p class="statutory-body-1em">If the Board of Governors determines that a condition, practice, or activity of a depository institution subsidiary or functionally regulated subsidiary of a nonbank financial company supervised by the Board of Governors does not comply with the regulations or orders prescribed by the Board of Governors under this Act, or otherwise poses a threat to the financial stability of the United States, the Board of Governors may recommend, in writing, to the primary financial regulatory agency for the subsidiary that such agency initiate a supervisory action or enforcement proceeding. The recommendation shall be accompanied by a written explanation of the concerns giving rise to the recommendation.</p>
<h4 class="paragraph-head">(2) Back-up authority of the Board of Governors</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">If, during the 60-day period beginning on the date on which the primary financial regulatory agency receives a recommendation under paragraph (1), the primary financial regulatory agency does not take supervisory or enforcement action against a subsidiary that is acceptable to the Board of Governors, the Board of Governors (upon a vote of its members) may take the recommended supervisory or enforcement action, as if the subsidiary were a bank holding company subject to supervision by the Board of Governors.</p>

<p class="statutory-body-1em">Notwithstanding section 1843(k)(6)(B) of this title, a bank holding company with total consolidated assets equal to or greater than $250,000,000,000 or a nonbank financial company supervised by the Board of Governors shall not acquire direct or indirect ownership or control of any voting shares of any company (other than an insured depository institution) that is engaged in activities described in section 1843(k) of this title having total consolidated assets of $10,000,000,000 or more, without providing written notice to the Board of Governors in advance of the transaction.</p>
<h4 class="paragraph-head">(2) Exemptions</h4>

<!-- field-end:head -->
<!-- field-start:statute -->
<h4 class="subsection-head">(a) In general</h4>
<h4 class="paragraph-head">(1) Purpose</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">In order to prevent or mitigate risks to the financial stability of the United States that could arise from the material financial distress or failure, or ongoing activities, of large, interconnected financial institutions, the Board of Governors shall, on its own or pursuant to recommendations by the Council under section 5325 of this title, establish prudential standards for nonbank financial companies supervised by the Board of Governors and bank holding companies with total consolidated assets equal to or greater than $250,000,000,000 that&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(A) are more stringent than the standards and requirements applicable to nonbank financial companies and bank holding companies that do not present similar risks to the financial stability of the United States; and</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(B) increase in stringency, based on the considerations identified in subsection (b)(3).</p>
<h4 class="paragraph-head">(2) Tailored application</h4>
<h4 class="subparagraph-head">(A) In general</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">In prescribing more stringent prudential standards under this section, the Board of Governors shall, on its own or pursuant to a recommendation by the Council in accordance with section 5325 of this title, differentiate among companies on an individual basis or by category, taking into consideration their capital structure, riskiness, complexity, financial activities (including the financial activities of their subsidiaries), size, and any other risk-related factors that the Board of Governors deems appropriate.</p>
<h4 class="subparagraph-head">(B) Adjustment of threshold for application of certain standards</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">The Board of Governors may, pursuant to a recommendation by the Council in accordance with section 5325 of this title, establish an asset threshold above the applicable threshold for the application of any standard <!-- PDFPage:1858 -->established under subsections (c) through (g).</p>
<h4 class="subparagraph-head">(C) Risks to financial stability and safety and soundness</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">The Board of Governors may by order or rule promulgated pursuant to section 553 of title 5 apply any prudential standard established under this section to any bank holding company or bank holding companies with total consolidated assets equal to or greater than $100,000,000,000 to which the prudential standard does not otherwise apply provided that the Board of Governors&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-3em">(i) determines that application of the prudential standard is appropriate&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-4em">(I) to prevent or mitigate risks to the financial stability of the United States, as described in paragraph (1); or</p>
<p class="statutory-body-4em">(II) to promote the safety and soundness of the bank holding company or bank holding companies; and</p>
<br class="Q04" />
<p class="statutory-body-3em">(ii) takes into consideration the bank holding company's or bank holding companies&apos; capital structure, riskiness, complexity, financial activities (including financial activities of subsidiaries), size, and any other risk-related factors that the Board of Governors deems appropriate.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(b) Development of prudential standards</h4>
<h4 class="paragraph-head">(1) In general</h4>
<h4 class="subparagraph-head">(A) Required standards</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">The Board of Governors shall establish prudential standards for nonbank financial companies supervised by the Board of Governors and bank holding companies described in subsection (a), that shall include&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-3em">(i) risk-based capital requirements and leverage limits, unless the Board of Governors, in consultation with the Council, determines that such requirements are not appropriate for a company subject to more stringent prudential standards because of the activities of such company (such as investment company activities or assets under management) or structure, in which case, the Board of Governors shall apply other standards that result in similarly stringent risk controls;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-3em">(ii) liquidity requirements;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-3em">(iii) overall risk management requirements;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-3em">(iv) resolution plan requirements; and</p>
<p class="statutory-body-3em">(v) concentration limits.</p>
<h4 class="subparagraph-head">(B) Additional standards authorized</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">The Board of Governors may establish additional prudential standards for nonbank financial companies supervised by the Board of Governors and bank holding companies described in subsection (a), that include&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-3em">(i) a contingent capital requirement;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-3em">(ii) enhanced public disclosures, including credit exposure reports;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-3em">(iii) short-term debt limits; and</p>
<p class="statutory-body-3em">(iv) such other prudential standards as the Board or Governors, on its own or pursuant to a recommendation made by the Council in accordance with section 5325 of this title, determines are appropriate.</p>
<h4 class="paragraph-head">(2) Standards for foreign financial companies</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">In applying the standards set forth in paragraph (1) to any foreign nonbank financial company supervised by the Board of Governors or foreign-based bank holding company, the Board of Governors shall&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(A) give due regard to the principle of national treatment and equality of competitive opportunity; and</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(B) take into account the extent to which the foreign financial company is subject on a consolidated basis to home country standards that are comparable to those applied to financial companies in the United States.</p>
<h4 class="paragraph-head">(3) Considerations</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">In prescribing prudential standards under paragraph (1), the Board of Governors shall&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(A) take into account differences among nonbank financial companies supervised by the Board of Governors and bank holding companies described in subsection (a), based on&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-3em">(i) the factors described in subsections (a) and (b) of section 5323 of this title;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-3em">(ii) whether the company owns an insured depository institution;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-3em">(iii) nonfinancial activities and affiliations of the company; and</p>
<p class="statutory-body-3em">(iv) any other risk-related factors that the Board of Governors determines appropriate;</p>
<br class="Q04" />
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(B) to the extent possible, ensure that small changes in the factors listed in subsections (a) and (b) of section 5323 of this title would not result in sharp, discontinuous changes in the prudential standards established under paragraph (1) of this subsection;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(C) take into account any recommendations of the Council under section 5325 of this title; and</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(D) adapt the required standards as appropriate in light of any predominant line of business of such company, including assets under management or other activities for which particular standards may not be appropriate.</p>
<h4 class="paragraph-head">(4) Consultation</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">Before imposing prudential standards or any other requirements pursuant to this section, including notices of deficiencies in resolution plans and more stringent requirements or divestiture orders resulting from such notices, that are likely to have a significant impact on a functionally regulated subsidiary or depository institution subsidiary of a nonbank financial company supervised by the Board of Governors or a bank holding company described in subsection (a), the Board of Governors shall consult with each Council member that primarily supervises any such subsidiary with respect to any such standard or requirement.</p>
<h4 class="paragraph-head">(5) Report</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">The Board of Governors shall submit an annual report to Congress regarding the implementation of the prudential standards required pursuant to paragraph (1), including the use of such standards to mitigate risks to the financial stability of the United States.</p>
<!-- PDFPage:1859 --><h4 class="subsection-head">(c) Contingent capital</h4>
<h4 class="paragraph-head">(1) In general</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">Subsequent to submission by the Council of a report to Congress under section 5325(c) of this title, the Board of Governors may issue regulations that require each nonbank financial company supervised by the Board of Governors and bank holding companies described in subsection (a) to maintain a minimum amount of contingent capital that is convertible to equity in times of financial stress.</p>
<h4 class="paragraph-head">(2) Factors to consider</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">In issuing regulations under this subsection, the Board of Governors shall consider&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(A) the results of the study undertaken by the Council, and any recommendations of the Council, under section 5325(c) of this title;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(B) an appropriate transition period for implementation of contingent capital under this subsection;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(C) the factors described in subsection (b)(3)(A);</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(D) capital requirements applicable to the nonbank financial company supervised by the Board of Governors or a bank holding company described in subsection (a), and subsidiaries thereof; and</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(E) any other factor that the Board of Governors deems appropriate.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(d) Resolution plan and credit exposure reports</h4>
<h4 class="paragraph-head">(1) Resolution plan</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">The Board of Governors shall require each nonbank financial company supervised by the Board of Governors and bank holding companies described in subsection (a) to report periodically to the Board of Governors, the Council, and the Corporation the plan of such company for rapid and orderly resolution in the event of material financial distress or failure, which shall include&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(A) information regarding the manner and extent to which any insured depository institution affiliated with the company is adequately protected from risks arising from the activities of any nonbank subsidiaries of the company;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(B) full descriptions of the ownership structure, assets, liabilities, and contractual obligations of the company;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(C) identification of the cross-guarantees tied to different securities, identification of major counterparties, and a process for determining to whom the collateral of the company is pledged; and</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(D) any other information that the Board of Governors and the Corporation jointly require by rule or order.</p>
<h4 class="paragraph-head">(2) Credit exposure report</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">The Board of Governors may require each nonbank financial company supervised by the Board of Governors and bank holding companies described in subsection (a) to report periodically to the Board of Governors, the Council, and the Corporation on&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(A) the nature and extent to which the company has credit exposure to other significant nonbank financial companies and significant bank holding companies; and</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(B) the nature and extent to which other significant nonbank financial companies and significant bank holding companies have credit exposure to that company.</p>
<h4 class="paragraph-head">(3) Review</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">The Board of Governors and the Corporation shall review the information provided in accordance with this subsection by each nonbank financial company supervised by the Board of Governors and bank holding company described in subsection (a).</p>
<h4 class="paragraph-head">(4) Notice of deficiencies</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">If the Board of Governors and the Corporation jointly determine, based on their review under paragraph (3), that the resolution plan of a nonbank financial company supervised by the Board of Governors or a bank holding company described in subsection (a) is not credible or would not facilitate an orderly resolution of the company under title 11&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(A) the Board of Governors and the Corporation shall notify the company of the deficiencies in the resolution plan; and</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(B) the company shall resubmit the resolution plan within a timeframe determined by the Board of Governors and the Corporation, with revisions demonstrating that the plan is credible and would result in an orderly resolution under title 11, including any proposed changes in business operations and corporate structure to facilitate implementation of the plan.</p>
<h4 class="paragraph-head">(5) Failure to resubmit credible plan</h4>
<h4 class="subparagraph-head">(A) In general</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">If a nonbank financial company supervised by the Board of Governors or a bank holding company described in subsection (a) fails to timely resubmit the resolution plan as required under paragraph (4), with such revisions as are required under subparagraph (B), the Board of Governors and the Corporation may jointly impose more stringent capital, leverage, or liquidity requirements, or restrictions on the growth, activities, or operations of the company, or any subsidiary thereof, until such time as the company resubmits a plan that remedies the deficiencies.</p>
<h4 class="subparagraph-head">(B) Divestiture</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">The Board of Governors and the Corporation, in consultation with the Council, may jointly direct a nonbank financial company supervised by the Board of Governors or a bank holding company described in subsection (a), by order, to divest certain assets or operations identified by the Board of Governors and the Corporation, to facilitate an orderly resolution of such company under title 11, in the event of the failure of such company, in any case in which&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-3em">(i) the Board of Governors and the Corporation have jointly imposed more stringent requirements on the company pursuant to subparagraph (A); and</p>
<p class="statutory-body-3em">(ii) the company has failed, within the 2-year period beginning on the date of the imposition of such requirements under subparagraph (A), to resubmit the resolu<!-- PDFPage:1860 -->tion plan with such revisions as were required under paragraph (4)(B).</p>
<h4 class="paragraph-head">(6) No limiting effect</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">A resolution plan submitted in accordance with this subsection shall not be binding on a bankruptcy court, a receiver appointed under subchapter II, or any other authority that is authorized or required to resolve the nonbank financial company supervised by the Board, any bank holding company, or any subsidiary or affiliate of the foregoing.</p>
<h4 class="paragraph-head">(7) No private right of action</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">No private right of action may be based on any resolution plan submitted in accordance with this subsection.</p>
<h4 class="paragraph-head">(8) Rules</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">Not later than 18 months after July 21, 2010, the Board of Governors and the Corporation shall jointly issue final rules implementing this subsection.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(e) Concentration limits</h4>
<h4 class="paragraph-head">(1) Standards</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">In order to limit the risks that the failure of any individual company could pose to a nonbank financial company supervised by the Board of Governors or a bank holding company described in subsection (a), the Board of Governors, by regulation, shall prescribe standards that limit such risks.</p>
<h4 class="paragraph-head">(2) Limitation on credit exposure</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">The regulations prescribed by the Board of Governors under paragraph (1) shall prohibit each nonbank financial company supervised by the Board of Governors and bank holding company described in subsection (a) from having credit exposure to any unaffiliated company that exceeds 25 percent of the capital stock and surplus (or such lower amount as the Board of Governors may determine by regulation to be necessary to mitigate risks to the financial stability of the United States) of the company.</p>
<h4 class="paragraph-head">(3) Credit exposure</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">For purposes of paragraph (2), &quot;credit exposure&quot; to a company means&mdash;</p>

<h4 class="subsection-head">(b) Requirement</h4>
<h4 class="paragraph-head">(1) In general</h4>
<h4 class="subparagraph-head">(A) Board authority</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">If a nonbank financial company supervised by the Board of Governors conducts activities other than those that are determined to be financial in nature or incidental thereto under section 1843(k) of this title, the Board of Governors may require such company to establish and conduct all or a portion of such activities that are determined to be financial in nature or incidental thereto in or through an intermediate holding company established pursuant to regulation of the Board of Governors, not later than 90 days (or such longer period as the Board of Governors may deem appropriate) after the date on which the nonbank financial company supervised by the Board of Governors is notified of the determination of the Board of Governors under this section.</p>

<h4 class="paragraph-head">(3) Source of strength</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">A company that directly or indirectly controls an intermediate holding company established under this section shall serve as a source of strength to its subsidiary intermediate holding company.</p>

<h4 class="paragraph-head">(5) Limited parent company enforcement</h4>
<h4 class="subparagraph-head">(A) In general</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">In addition to any other authority of the Board of Governors, the Board of Governors may enforce compliance with the provisions of this subsection that are applicable to any company described in paragraph (1) that controls an intermediate holding company under section 8 of the Federal Deposit Insurance Act [12 U.S.C. 1818], and such company shall be subject to such section (solely for such purposes) in the same manner and to the same extent as if such company were a bank holding company.</p>
<h4 class="subparagraph-head">(B) Application of other Act</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">Any violation of this subsection by any company that controls an intermediate holding company may also be treated as a violation of the Federal Deposit Insurance Act [12 U.S.C. 1811 et seq.] for purposes of subparagraph (A).</p>
<h4 class="subparagraph-head">(C) No effect on other authority</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">No provision of this paragraph shall be construed as limiting any authority of the Board of Governors or any other Federal agency under any other provision of law.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(c) Regulations</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">The Board of Governors&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(1) shall promulgate regulations to establish the criteria for determining whether to require a nonbank financial company supervised by the Board of Governors to establish an intermediate holding company under subsection (b); and</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(2) may promulgate regulations to establish any restrictions or limitations on transactions between an intermediate holding company or a nonbank financial company supervised by the Board of Governors and its affiliates, as necessary to prevent unsafe and unsound practices in connection with transactions between such company, or any subsidiary thereof, and its parent company or affiliates that are not subsidiaries of such company, except that such regulations shall not restrict or limit any transaction in connection with the bona fide acquisition or lease by an unaffiliated person of assets, goods, or services.</p>

<p class="statutory-body-1em">The Council, on a nondelegable basis and by a vote of not fewer than 2/3 of members then serving, including an affirmative vote by the Chairperson of the Council, shall designate those financial market utilities or payment, clearing, or settlement activities that the Council determines are, or are likely to become, systemically important.</p>
<h4 class="paragraph-head">(2) Considerations</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">In determining whether a financial market utility or payment, clearing, or settlement activity is, or is likely to become, systemically important, the Council shall take into consideration the following:</p>

<h4 class="subparagraph-head">(D) Written submissions</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">Upon receipt of a timely request, the Council shall fix a time, not more than 30 days after receipt of the request, unless extended at the request of the financial market utility or financial institution, and place at which the financial market utility or financial institution may appear, personally or through counsel, to submit written materials, or, at the sole discretion of the Council, oral testimony or oral argument.</p>
<h4 class="paragraph-head">(3) Emergency exception</h4>
<h4 class="subparagraph-head">(A) Waiver or modification by vote of the Council</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">The Council may waive or modify the requirements of paragraph (2) if the Council determines, by an affirmative vote of not fewer than 2/3 of members then serving, including an affirmative vote by the Chairperson of the Council, that the waiver or modification is necessary to prevent or mitigate an immediate threat to the financial system posed by the financial market utility or the payment, clearing, or settlement activity.</p>
<h4 class="subparagraph-head">(B) Notice of waiver or modification</h4>

All notices to financial institutions under this subsection shall be published in the Federal Register.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(e) Extension of time periods</h4>

<h4 class="subsection-head">(c) Enforcement</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">For purposes of enforcing the provisions of this subchapter, a designated financial market <!-- PDFPage:1935 -->utility shall be subject to, and the appropriate Supervisory Agency shall have authority under the provisions of subsections (b) through (n) of section 1818 of this title in the same manner and to the same extent as if the designated financial market utility was an insured depository institution and the Supervisory Agency was the appropriate Federal banking agency for such insured depository institution.</p>

<p class="statutory-body-1em">The Board of Governors may, after consulting with the Council and the Supervisory Agency, at any time recommend to the Supervisory Agency that such agency take enforcement action against a designated financial market utility in order to prevent or mitigate significant liquidity, credit, operational, or other risks to the financial markets or to the financial stability of the United States. Any such recommendation for enforcement action shall provide a detailed analysis supporting the recommendation of the Board of Governors.</p>
<h4 class="paragraph-head">(2) Consideration</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">The Supervisory Agency shall consider the recommendation of the Board of Governors and submit a response to the Board of Governors within 60 days.</p>
<h4 class="paragraph-head">(3) Binding arbitration</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">If the Supervisory Agency rejects, in whole or in part, the recommendation of the Board of Governors, the Board of Governors may refer the recommendation to the Council for a binding decision on whether an enforcement action is warranted.</p>
<h4 class="paragraph-head">(4) Enforcement action</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">Upon an affirmative vote by a majority of the Council in favor of the Board of Governors&apos; recommendation under paragraph (3), the Council may require the Supervisory Agency to&mdash;</p>

<p class="statutory-body-3em">(ii) the condition of a designated financial market utility poses an imminent risk of substantial harm to financial institutions, critical markets, or the broader financial system; and</p>
<br class="Q04" />
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(B) the imminent risk of substantial harm precludes the Board of Governors&apos; use of the procedures in subsection (e).</p>

<h3 class="section-head">&sect;5563. Hearings and adjudication proceedings</h3>
<!-- field-end:head -->
<!-- field-start:statute -->
<h4 class="subsection-head">(a) In general</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">The Bureau is authorized to conduct hearings and adjudication proceedings with respect to any person in the manner prescribed by chapter 5 of title 5 in order to ensure or enforce compliance with&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(1) the provisions of this title,<sup><a href="#5563_1_target" name="5563_1">1</a></sup> including any rules prescribed by the Bureau under this title;&#160;<sup><a href="#5563_1_target" name="5563_1">1</a></sup> and</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(2) any other Federal law that the Bureau is authorized to enforce, including an enumerated consumer law, and any regulations or order prescribed thereunder, unless such Federal law specifically limits the Bureau from conducting a hearing or adjudication proceeding and only to the extent of such limitation.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(b) Special rules for cease-and-desist proceedings</h4>
<h4 class="paragraph-head">(1) Orders authorized</h4>
<h4 class="subparagraph-head">(A) In general</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">If, in the opinion of the Bureau, any covered person or service provider is engaging <!-- PDFPage:1986 -->or has engaged in an activity that violates a law, rule, or any condition imposed in writing on the person by the Bureau, the Bureau may, subject to sections 5514, 5515, and 5516 of this title, issue and serve upon the covered person or service provider a notice of charges in respect thereof.</p>
<h4 class="subparagraph-head">(B) Content of notice</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">The notice under subparagraph (A) shall contain a statement of the facts constituting the alleged violation or violations, and shall fix a time and place at which a hearing will be held to determine whether an order to cease and desist should issue against the covered person or service provider, such hearing to be held not earlier than 30 days nor later than 60 days after the date of service of such notice, unless an earlier or a later date is set by the Bureau, at the request of any party so served.</p>
<h4 class="subparagraph-head">(C) Consent</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">Unless the party or parties served under subparagraph (B) appear at the hearing personally or by a duly authorized representative, such person shall be deemed to have consented to the issuance of the cease-and-desist order.</p>
<h4 class="subparagraph-head">(D) Procedure</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">In the event of consent under subparagraph (C), or if, upon the record, made at any such hearing, the Bureau finds that any violation specified in the notice of charges has been established, the Bureau may issue and serve upon the covered person or service provider an order to cease and desist from the violation or practice. Such order may, by provisions which may be mandatory or otherwise, require the covered person or service provider to cease and desist from the subject activity, and to take affirmative action to correct the conditions resulting from any such violation.</p>
<h4 class="paragraph-head">(2) Effectiveness of order</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">A cease-and-desist order shall become effective at the expiration of 30 days after the date of service of an order under paragraph (1) upon the covered person or service provider concerned (except in the case of a cease-and-desist order issued upon consent, which shall become effective at the time specified therein), and shall remain effective and enforceable as provided therein, except to such extent as the order is stayed, modified, terminated, or set aside by action of the Bureau or a reviewing court.</p>
<h4 class="paragraph-head">(3) Decision and appeal</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">Any hearing provided for in this subsection shall be held in the Federal judicial district or in the territory in which the residence or principal office or place of business of the person is located unless the person consents to another place, and shall be conducted in accordance with the provisions of chapter 5 of title 5. After such hearing, and within 90 days after the Bureau has notified the parties that the case has been submitted to the Bureau for final decision, the Bureau shall render its decision (which shall include findings of fact upon which its decision is predicated) and shall issue and serve upon each party to the proceeding an order or orders consistent with the provisions of this section. Judicial review of any such order shall be exclusively as provided in this subsection. Unless a petition for review is timely filed in a court of appeals of the United States, as provided in paragraph (4), and thereafter until the record in the proceeding has been filed as provided in paragraph (4), the Bureau may at any time, upon such notice and in such manner as the Bureau shall determine proper, modify, terminate, or set aside any such order. Upon filing of the record as provided, the Bureau may modify, terminate, or set aside any such order with permission of the court.</p>
<h4 class="paragraph-head">(4) Appeal to court of appeals</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">Any party to any proceeding under this subsection may obtain a review of any order served pursuant to this subsection (other than an order issued with the consent of the person concerned) by the filing in the court of appeals of the United States for the circuit in which the principal office of the covered person is located, or in the United States Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia Circuit, within 30 days after the date of service of such order, a written petition praying that the order of the Bureau be modified, terminated, or set aside. A copy of such petition shall be forthwith transmitted by the clerk of the court to the Bureau, and thereupon the Bureau shall file in the court the record in the proceeding, as provided in section 2112 of title 28. Upon the filing of such petition, such court shall have jurisdiction, which upon the filing of the record shall except as provided in the last sentence of paragraph (3) be exclusive, to affirm, modify, terminate, or set aside, in whole or in part, the order of the Bureau. Review of such proceedings shall be had as provided in chapter 7 of title 5. The judgment and decree of the court shall be final, except that the same shall be subject to review by the Supreme Court of the United States, upon certiorari, as provided in section 1254 of title 28.</p>
<h4 class="paragraph-head">(5) No stay</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">The commencement of proceedings for judicial review under paragraph (4) shall not, unless specifically ordered by the court, operate as a stay of any order issued by the Bureau.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(c) Special rules for temporary cease-and-desist proceedings</h4>
<h4 class="paragraph-head">(1) In general</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">Whenever the Bureau determines that the violation specified in the notice of charges served upon a person, including a service provider, pursuant to subsection (b), or the continuation thereof, is likely to cause the person to be insolvent or otherwise prejudice the interests of consumers before the completion of the proceedings conducted pursuant to subsection (b), the Bureau may issue a temporary order requiring the person to cease and desist from any such violation or practice and to take affirmative action to prevent or remedy such insolvency or other condition pending completion of such proceedings. Such order <!-- PDFPage:1987 -->may include any requirement authorized under this part. Such order shall become effective upon service upon the person and, unless set aside, limited, or suspended by a court in proceedings authorized by paragraph (2), shall remain effective and enforceable pending the completion of the administrative proceedings pursuant to such notice and until such time as the Bureau shall dismiss the charges specified in such notice, or if a cease-and-desist order is issued against the person, until the effective date of such order.</p>
<h4 class="paragraph-head">(2) Appeal</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">Not later than 10 days after the covered person or service provider concerned has been served with a temporary cease-and-desist order, the person may apply to the United States district court for the judicial district in which the residence or principal office or place of business of the person is located, or the United States District Court for the District of Columbia, for an injunction setting aside, limiting, or suspending the enforcement, operation, or effectiveness of such order pending the completion of the administrative proceedings pursuant to the notice of charges served upon the person under subsection (b), and such court shall have jurisdiction to issue such injunction.</p>
<h4 class="paragraph-head">(3) Incomplete or inaccurate records</h4>
<h4 class="subparagraph-head">(A) Temporary order</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">If a notice of charges served under subsection (b) specifies, on the basis of particular facts and circumstances, that the books and records of a covered person or service provider are so incomplete or inaccurate that the Bureau is unable to determine the financial condition of that person or the details or purpose of any transaction or transactions that may have a material effect on the financial condition of that person, the Bureau may issue a temporary order requiring&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-3em">(i) the cessation of any activity or practice which gave rise, whether in whole or in part, to the incomplete or inaccurate state of the books or records; or</p>
<p class="statutory-body-3em">(ii) affirmative action to restore such books or records to a complete and accurate state, until the completion of the proceedings under subsection (b)(1).</p>
<h4 class="subparagraph-head">(B) Effective period</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">Any temporary order issued under subparagraph (A)&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-3em">(i) shall become effective upon service; and</p>
<p class="statutory-body-3em">(ii) unless set aside, limited, or suspended by a court in proceedings under paragraph (2), shall remain in effect and enforceable until the earlier of&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-4em">(I) the completion of the proceeding initiated under subsection (b) in connection with the notice of charges; or</p>
<p class="statutory-body-4em">(II) the date the Bureau determines, by examination or otherwise, that the books and records of the covered person or service provider are accurate and reflect the financial condition thereof.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(d) Special rules for enforcement of orders</h4>
<h4 class="paragraph-head">(1) In general</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">The Bureau may in its discretion apply to the United States district court within the jurisdiction of which the principal office or place of business of the person is located, for the enforcement of any effective and outstanding notice or order issued under this section, and such court shall have jurisdiction and power to order and require compliance herewith.</p>
<h4 class="paragraph-head">(2) Exception</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">Except as otherwise provided in this subsection, no court shall have jurisdiction to affect by injunction or otherwise the issuance or enforcement of any notice or order or to review, modify, suspend, terminate, or set aside any such notice or order.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(e) Rules</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">The Bureau shall prescribe rules establishing such procedures as may be necessary to carry out this section.</p>

<h4 class="subsection-head">(b) Definition of covered employee</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">For the purposes of this section, the term &quot;covered employee&quot; means any individual performing tasks related to the offering or provision of a consumer financial product or service.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(c) Procedures and timetables</h4>
<h4 class="paragraph-head">(1) Complaint</h4>
<h4 class="subparagraph-head">(A) In general</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">A person who believes that he or she has been discharged or otherwise discriminated against by any person in violation of subsection (a) may, not later than 180 days after the date on which such alleged violation occurs, file (or have any person file on his or her behalf) a complaint with the Secretary of Labor alleging such discharge or discrimination and identifying the person responsible for such act.</p>
<h4 class="subparagraph-head">(B) Actions of Secretary of Labor</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">Upon receipt of such a complaint, the Secretary of Labor shall notify, in writing, the person named in the complaint who is alleged to have committed the violation, of&mdash;</p>

<p class="statutory-body-3em">(ii) the allegations contained in the complaint;</p>

<h4 class="subparagraph-head">(A) In general</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">Not later than 60 days after the date of receipt of a complaint filed under paragraph (1), and after affording the complainant and the person named in the complaint who is alleged to have committed the violation that is the basis for the complaint an opportunity to submit to the Secretary of Labor a written response to the complaint and an opportunity to meet with a representative of the Secretary of Labor to present statements from witnesses, the Secretary of Labor shall&mdash;</p>

<h4 class="subparagraph-head">(B) Notice of relief available</h4>

The filing of such objections shall not operate to stay any reinstatement remedy contained in the preliminary order. Any such hearing shall be conducted expeditiously, and if a hearing is not requested in such 30-day period, the preliminary order shall be deemed a final order that is not subject to judicial review.</p>
<h4 class="paragraph-head">(3) Grounds for determination of complaints</h4>
<h4 class="subparagraph-head">(A) In general</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">The Secretary of Labor shall dismiss a complaint filed under this subsection, and shall not conduct an investigation otherwise required under paragraph (2), unless the complainant makes a prima facie showing that any behavior described in paragraphs (1) through (4) of subsection (a) was a contributing factor in the unfavorable personnel action alleged in the complaint.</p>
<h4 class="subparagraph-head">(B) Rebuttal evidence</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">Notwithstanding a finding by the Secretary of Labor that the complainant has made the showing required under subparagraph (A), no investigation otherwise required under paragraph (2) shall be conducted, if the employer demonstrates, by clear and convincing evidence, that the employer would have taken the same unfavorable personnel action in the absence of that behavior.</p>
<h4 class="subparagraph-head">(C) Evidentiary standards</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">The Secretary of Labor may determine that a violation of subsection (a) has occurred only if the complainant demonstrates that any behavior described in paragraphs (1) through (4) of subsection (a) was a contributing factor in the unfavorable personnel action alleged in the complaint. Relief may not be ordered under subparagraph (A) if the employer demonstrates by clear and convincing evidence that the employer would have taken the same unfavorable personnel action in the absence of that behavior.</p>
<h4 class="paragraph-head">(4) Issuance of final orders; review procedures</h4>
<h4 class="subparagraph-head">(A) Timing</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">Not later than 120 days after the date of conclusion of any hearing under paragraph (2), the Secretary of Labor shall issue a final order providing the relief prescribed by this paragraph or denying the complaint. At any time before issuance of a final order, a proceeding under this subsection may be terminated on the basis of a settlement agreement entered into by the Secretary of Labor, <!-- PDFPage:1991 -->the complainant, and the person alleged to have committed the violation.</p>
<h4 class="subparagraph-head">(B) Penalties</h4>
<h4 class="clause-head">(i) Order of Secretary of Labor</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-3em">If, in response to a complaint filed under paragraph (1), the Secretary of Labor determines that a violation of subsection (a) has occurred, the Secretary of Labor shall order the person who committed such violation&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-4em">(I) to take affirmative action to abate the violation;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-4em">(II) to reinstate the complainant to his or her former position, together with compensation (including back pay) and restore the terms, conditions, and privileges associated with his or her employment; and</p>
<p class="statutory-body-4em">(III) to provide compensatory damages to the complainant.</p>
<h4 class="clause-head">(ii) Penalty</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-3em">If an order is issued under clause (i), the Secretary of Labor, at the request of the complainant, shall assess against the person against whom the order is issued, a sum equal to the aggregate amount of all costs and expenses (including attorney fees and expert witness fees) reasonably incurred, as determined by the Secretary of Labor, by the complainant for, or in connection with, the bringing of the complaint upon which the order was issued.</p>
<h4 class="subparagraph-head">(C) Penalty for frivolous claims</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">If the Secretary of Labor finds that a complaint under paragraph (1) is frivolous or has been brought in bad faith, the Secretary of Labor may award to the prevailing employer a reasonable attorney fee, not exceeding $1,000, to be paid by the complainant.</p>
<h4 class="subparagraph-head">(D) De novo review</h4>
<h4 class="clause-head">(i) Failure of the Secretary to act</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-3em">If the Secretary of Labor has not issued a final order within 210 days after the date of filing of a complaint under this subsection, or within 90 days after the date of receipt of a written determination, the complainant may bring an action at law or equity for de novo review in the appropriate district court of the United States having jurisdiction, which shall have jurisdiction over such an action without regard to the amount in controversy, and which action shall, at the request of either party to such action, be tried by the court with a jury.</p>
<h4 class="clause-head">(ii) Procedures</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-3em">A proceeding under clause (i) shall be governed by the same legal burdens of proof specified in paragraph (3). The court shall have jurisdiction to grant all relief necessary to make the employee whole, including injunctive relief and compensatory damages, including&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-4em">(I) reinstatement with the same seniority status that the employee would have had, but for the discharge or discrimination;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-4em">(II) the amount of back pay, with interest; and</p>
<p class="statutory-body-4em">(III) compensation for any special damages sustained as a result of the discharge or discrimination, including litigation costs, expert witness fees, and reasonable attorney fees.</p>
<h4 class="subparagraph-head">(E) Other appeals</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">Unless the complainant brings an action under subparagraph (D), any person adversely affected or aggrieved by a final order issued under subparagraph (A) may file a petition for review of the order in the United States Court of Appeals for the circuit in which the violation with respect to which the order was issued, allegedly occurred or the circuit in which the complainant resided on the date of such violation, not later than 60 days after the date of the issuance of the final order of the Secretary of Labor under subparagraph (A). Review shall conform to chapter 7 of title 5. The commencement of proceedings under this subparagraph shall not, unless ordered by the court, operate as a stay of the order. An order of the Secretary of Labor with respect to which review could have been obtained under this subparagraph shall not be subject to judicial review in any criminal or other civil proceeding.</p>
<h4 class="paragraph-head">(5) Failure to comply with order</h4>
<h4 class="subparagraph-head">(A) Actions by the Secretary</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">If any person has failed to comply with a final order issued under paragraph (4), the Secretary of Labor may file a civil action in the United States district court for the district in which the violation was found to have occurred, or in the United States district court for the District of Columbia, to enforce such order. In actions brought under this paragraph, the district courts shall have jurisdiction to grant all appropriate relief including injunctive relief and compensatory damages.</p>
<h4 class="subparagraph-head">(B) Civil actions to compel compliance</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">A person on whose behalf an order was issued under paragraph (4) may commence a civil action against the person to whom such order was issued to require compliance with such order. The appropriate United States district court shall have jurisdiction, without regard to the amount in controversy or the citizenship of the parties, to enforce such order.</p>
<h4 class="subparagraph-head">(C) Award of costs authorized</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">The court, in issuing any final order under this paragraph, may award costs of litigation (including reasonable attorney and expert witness fees) to any party, whenever the court determines such award is appropriate.</p>
<h4 class="subparagraph-head">(D) Mandamus proceedings</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">Any nondiscretionary duty imposed by this section shall be enforceable in a mandamus proceeding brought under section 1361 of title 28.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(d) Unenforceability of certain agreements</h4>
<h4 class="paragraph-head">(1) No waiver of rights and remedies</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">Except as provided under paragraph (3), and notwithstanding any other provision of law, <!-- PDFPage:1992 -->the rights and remedies provided for in this section may not be waived by any agreement, policy, form, or condition of employment, including by any predispute arbitration agreement.</p>
<h4 class="paragraph-head">(2) No predispute arbitration agreements</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">Except as provided under paragraph (3), and notwithstanding any other provision of law, no predispute arbitration agreement shall be valid or enforceable to the extent that it requires arbitration of a dispute arising under this section.</p>
<h4 class="paragraph-head">(3) Exception</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">Notwithstanding paragraphs (1) and (2), an arbitration provision in a collective bargaining agreement shall be enforceable as to disputes arising under subsection (a)(4), unless the Bureau determines, by rule, that such provision is inconsistent with the purposes of this title.<sup><a href="#5567_1_target" name="5567_1">1</a></sup></p>
