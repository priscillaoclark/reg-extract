<h4 class="subsection-head">(b) Timing</h4>

<h4 class="subsection-head">(d) Eliminating interest rate disparities</h4>
<h4 class="paragraph-head">(1) In general</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">Upon request by the Director, an enterprise shall provide to the Director, in a form determined by the Director, data the Director may review to determine whether there exist disparities in interest rates charged on mortgages to borrowers who are minorities as compared with comparable mortgages to borrowers of similar creditworthiness who are not minorities.</p>

<p class="statutory-body-1em">The Director shall submit to the Committee on Financial Services of the House of Rep<!-- PDFPage:1669 -->resentatives and the Committee on Banking, Housing, and Urban Affairs of the Senate a report describing the actions taken, and being taken, by the Director to carry out this subsection. No such report shall identify any lender or lenders who have not been found to have engaged in discriminatory lending practices pursuant to a final adjudication on the record, and after opportunity for an administrative hearing, in accordance with subchapter II of chapter 5 of title 5.</p>
<h4 class="paragraph-head">(4) Protection of identity of individuals</h4>

<p class="statutory-body-2em">(C) Very low-income families.</p>
<h4 class="paragraph-head">(2) Refinancing mortgages</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">A goal for purchase of conventional, conforming mortgages on owner-occupied, single-family housing for low-income families that are given to pay off or prepay an existing loan secured by the same property.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(b) Goals as a percentage of total mortgage purchases</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">The goals established under paragraphs (1) and (2) of subsection (a) shall be established as a percentage of the total number of conventional, conforming, single-family, owner-occupied, purchase money mortgages purchased by the enterprise, or as percentage of the total number of conventional, single-family, owner-occupied refinance mortgages purchased by the enterprise, as applicable, that are mortgages for the types of families specified in paragraphs (1) and (2) of subsection (a).</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(c) Single-family, owner-occupied rental housing units</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">The Director shall require each enterprise to report the number of rental housing units affordable to low-income families each year which are contained in mortgages purchased by the enterprise financing 2- to 4-unit single-family, owner-occupied properties and may, by regulation, establish additional requirements relating to such units.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(d) Determination of compliance</h4>
<h4 class="paragraph-head">(1) In general</h4>

<p class="statutory-body-1em">An enterprise shall be considered to be in compliance with a housing goal under subparagraph (A), (B), or (C) of subsection (a)(1) for a year only if, for the type of family described in such subparagraph, the percentage of the number of conventional, conforming, single-family, owner-occupied, purchase money mortgages purchased by the enterprise in such year that serve such families, meets or exceeds the target for the year for such type of family that is established under subsection (e).</p>
<h4 class="paragraph-head">(3) Refinance goal</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">An enterprise shall be considered to be in compliance with the refinance goal under subsection (a)(2) for a year only if the percentage of the number of conventional, conforming, single-family, owner-occupied refinance mortgages purchased by the enterprise in such year that serve low-income families meets or exceeds the target for the year that is established under subsection (e).</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(e) Annual targets</h4>
<h4 class="paragraph-head">(1) In general</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">The Director shall, by regulation, establish annual targets for each goal and subgoal under this section, provided that the Director shall not set prospective targets longer than three years.

<h4 class="paragraph-head">(2) Goals targets</h4>
<h4 class="subparagraph-head">(A) Calculation</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">The Director shall calculate, for each of the types of families described in subsection (a), the percentage, for each of the three years that most recently precede such year and for which information under the Home Mortgage Disclosure Act of 1975 [12 U.S.C. 2801 et seq.] is publicly available&mdash;</p>

<h4 class="paragraph-head">(5) Conforming mortgages</h4>

<h4 class="subsection-head">(f) Notice of determination and enterprise comment</h4>
<h4 class="paragraph-head">(1) Notice</h4>

<h4 class="subsection-head">(h) Consideration of properties with rental units</h4>

<h4 class="subsection-head">(i) Goals credit</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">The Director shall determine whether an enterprise shall receive full, partial, or no credit for a transaction toward achievement of any of the housing goals established pursuant to section 4562 and 4563 of this title. In making any such determination, the Director shall consider whether a transaction or activity of an enterprise is substantially equivalent to a mortgage purchase and either (1) creates a new market, or (2) adds liquidity to an existing market. No credit toward the achievement of the housing goals and subgoals established under this section may be given to the purchase of mortgages, including any transaction or activity of an enterprise determined to be substantially equivalent to a mortgage purchase, that is determined to be unacceptable or contrary to good lending practices, inconsistent with safety and soundness, or unauthorized for purchase by the enterprises, pursuant to regulations issued by the Director.</p>

<!-- field-end:head -->
<!-- field-start:statute -->
<h4 class="subsection-head">(a) Establishment of goal</h4>
<h4 class="paragraph-head">(1) In general</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">The Director shall, by regulation, establish a single annual goal, by either unit or dollar volume, of purchases by each enterprise of mortgages on multifamily housing that finance dwelling units affordable to low-income families.</p>
<h4 class="paragraph-head">(2) Additional requirements for units affordable to very low-income families</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">When establishing the goal under this section, the Director shall establish additional requirements for the purchase by each enterprise of mortgages on multifamily housing that finance dwelling units affordable to very low-income families.</p>
<h4 class="paragraph-head">(3) Reporting on smaller properties</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">The Director shall require each enterprise to report on the purchase by each enterprise of multifamily housing of a smaller or limited size that is affordable to low-income families, which may be based on multifamily projects of 5 to 50 units (as such numbers may be adjusted by the Director) or on mortgages of up to $5,000,000 (as such amount may be adjusted by the Director), and may, by regulation, establish such aditional&#160;<sup><a href="#4563_1_target" name="4563_1">1</a></sup> requirements related to such units.</p>
<h4 class="paragraph-head">(4) Factors</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">In establishing the goal and additional requirements under this section, the Director shall not consider segments of the market determined to be inconsistent with safety and soundness or unauthorized for purchase by the enterprises, and shall take into consideration&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(A) national multifamily mortgage credit needs and the ability of the enterprise to provide additional liquidity and stability for the multifamily mortgage market;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(B) the performance and effort of the enterprise in making mortgage credit available for multifamily housing in previous years;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(C) the size of the multifamily mortgage market for housing affordable to low-income and very low-income families, including the size of the multifamily markets for housing of a smaller or limited size;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(D) the ability of the enterprise to lead the market in making multifamily mortgage credit available, especially for multifamily housing described in paragraphs (1) and (2);</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(E) the availability of public subsidies; and</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(F) the need to maintain the sound financial condition of the enterprise.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(b) Units financed by housing finance agency bonds</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">The Director shall give full credit toward the achievement of the multifamily special affordable housing goal under this section (for purposes of section 4566 of this title) to dwelling units in multifamily housing that otherwise qualifies under such goal and that is financed by tax-exempt or taxable bonds issued by a State or local housing finance agency, if such bonds, in whole or in part&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(1) are secured by a guarantee of the enterprise; or</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(2) are purchased by the enterprise, except that the Director may give less than full credit for purchases of investment grade bonds, to the extent that such purchases do not provide a new market or add liquidity to an existing market.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(c) Measurement of performance</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">The Director shall monitor the performance of each enterprise in meeting the goals established under this section and shall evaluate such performance (for purposes of section 4566 of this title) based on whether the rent levels are affordable. A rent level shall be considered to be affordable for purposes of this subsection for low-income families if it does not exceed 30 percent of the maximum income level of such income category, with appropriate adjustments for unit size as measured by the number of bedrooms.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(d) Determination of compliance</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">The Director shall determine, for each year that the housing goal under this section is in effect pursuant to section 4561(a) of this title, whether each enterprise has complied with such goal and the additional requirements under subsection (a)(2).</p>

<p class="statutory-body-3em">(i) whether the enterprise has failed, or there is a substantial probability that the enterprise will fail, to meet the housing goal; and</p>

<p class="statutory-body-3em">(i) to achieve the goal for the next calendar year; and</p>

<br class="Q04" />
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(B) sufficiently specific to enable the Director to monitor compliance periodically.</p>
<h4 class="paragraph-head">(3) Deadline for submission</h4>

The purpose of the Housing Trust Fund under this section is to provide grants to States (as such term is defined in section 4502 of this title) for use&mdash;</p>

<h4 class="paragraph-head">(2) Excess funds</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">At the termination of the HOPE for Homeowners Program established under section 1715z&ndash;23 of this title, if amounts used to reimburse the Treasury under paragraph (1) exceed the total net cost to the Government of the HOPE for Homeowners Program, such amounts shall be used for their original purpose, as described in paragraphs (1)(B) and (2)(B) of section 4567(a) of this title.</p>
<h4 class="paragraph-head">(3) Treasury fund</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">The amounts referred to in subparagraphs (A) through (C) of paragraph (1) shall be deposited into a fund established in the Treasury of the United States by the Secretary of the Treasury for such purpose.</p>

<h4 class="paragraph-head">(3) Distribution to States by needs-based formula</h4>
<h4 class="subparagraph-head">(A) In general</h4>

<p class="statutory-body-3em">(iv) The ratio of very low-income renter households in the State paying more than 50 percent of income on rent relative to the aggregate number of very low-income renter households paying more than 50 percent of income on rent in all the States.</p>
<p class="statutory-body-3em">(v) The resulting sum calculated from the factors described in clauses (i) through (iv) shall be multiplied by the relative cost of construction in the State. For purposes of this subclause,<sup><a href="#4568_1_target" name="4568_1">1</a></sup> the term &quot;cost of construction&quot;&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-4em">(I) means the cost of construction or building rehabilitation in the State relative to the national cost of construction or building rehabilitation; and</p>
<p class="statutory-body-4em">(II) shall be calculated such that values higher than 1.0 indicate that the State's construction costs are higher than the national average, a value of 1.0 indicates that the State's construction costs are exactly the same as the national average, and values lower than 1.0 indicate that the State's cost of construction are lower than the national average.</p>

<p class="statutory-body-2em">If the formula amount determined under paragraph (3) for a fiscal year would allocate less than $3,000,000 to any of the 50 States of the United States or the District of Columbia, the allocation for such State of the United States or the District of Columbia shall be $3,000,000, and the increase shall be deducted pro rata from the allocations made to all other of the States (as such term is defined in section 4502 of this title).</p>
<h4 class="paragraph-head">(5) Allocation plans required</h4>
