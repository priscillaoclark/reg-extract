<h4 class="subsection-head">(a) Resolving problems to protect Fund</h4>
<h4 class="paragraph-head">(1) Purpose</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">The purpose of this section is to resolve the problems of insured credit unions at the least possible long-term loss to the Fund.</p>
<h4 class="paragraph-head">(2) Prompt corrective action required</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">The Board shall carry out the purpose of this section by taking prompt corrective action to resolve the problems of insured credit unions.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(b) Regulations required</h4>
<h4 class="paragraph-head">(1) Insured credit unions</h4>
<h4 class="subparagraph-head">(A) In general</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">The Board shall, by regulation, prescribe a system of prompt corrective action for insured credit unions that is&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-3em">(i) consistent with this section; and</p>
<p class="statutory-body-3em">(ii) comparable to section 1831o of this title.</p>
<h4 class="subparagraph-head">(B) Cooperative character of credit unions</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">The Board shall design the system required under subparagraph (A) to take into account that credit unions are not-for-profit cooperatives that&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-3em">(i) do not issue capital stock;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-3em">(ii) must rely on retained earnings to build net worth; and</p>
<p class="statutory-body-3em">(iii) have boards of directors that consist primarily of volunteers.</p>
<h4 class="paragraph-head">(2) New credit unions</h4>
<h4 class="subparagraph-head">(A) In general</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">In addition to regulations under paragraph (1), the Board shall, by regulation, prescribe a system of prompt corrective action that shall apply to new credit unions in lieu of this section and the regulations prescribed under paragraph (1).</p>
<h4 class="subparagraph-head">(B) Criteria for alternative system</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">The Board shall design the system prescribed under subparagraph (A)&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-3em">(i) to carry out the purpose of this section;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-3em">(ii) to recognize that credit unions (as cooperatives that do not issue capital stock) initially have no net worth, and give new credit unions reasonable time to accumulate net worth;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-3em">(iii) to create adequate incentives for new credit unions to become adequately capitalized by the time that they either&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-4em">(I) have been in operation for more than 10 years; or</p>
<p class="statutory-body-4em">(II) have more than $10,000,000 in total assets;</p>
<br class="Q04" />
<p class="statutory-body-3em">(iv) to impose appropriate restrictions and requirements on new credit unions that do not make sufficient progress toward becoming adequately capitalized; and</p>
<p class="statutory-body-3em">(v) to prevent evasion of the purpose of this section.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(c) Net worth categories</h4>
<h4 class="paragraph-head">(1) In general</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">For purposes of this section the following definitions shall apply:</p>
<h4 class="subparagraph-head">(A) Well capitalized</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">An insured credit union is &quot;well capitalized&quot; if&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-3em">(i) it has a net worth ratio of not less than 7 percent; and</p>
<p class="statutory-body-3em">(ii) it meets any applicable risk-based net worth requirement under subsection (d).</p>
<h4 class="subparagraph-head">(B) Adequately capitalized</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">An insured credit union is &quot;adequately capitalized&quot; if&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-3em">(i) it has a net worth ratio of not less than 6 percent; and</p>
<p class="statutory-body-3em">(ii) it meets any applicable risk-based net worth requirement under subsection (d).</p>
<h4 class="subparagraph-head">(C) Undercapitalized</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">An insured credit union is &quot;undercapitalized&quot; if&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-3em">(i) it has a net worth ratio of less than 6 percent; or</p>
<p class="statutory-body-3em">(ii) it fails to meet any applicable risk-based net worth requirement under subsection (d).</p>
<h4 class="subparagraph-head">(D) Significantly undercapitalized</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">An insured credit union is &quot;significantly undercapitalized&quot;&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-3em">(i) if it has a net worth ratio of less than 4 percent; or</p>
<p class="statutory-body-3em">(ii) if&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-4em">(I) it has a net worth ratio of less than 5 percent; and</p>
<p class="statutory-body-4em">(II) it&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-5em">(aa) fails to submit an acceptable net worth restoration plan within the time allowed under subsection (f); or</p>
<p class="statutory-body-5em">(bb) materially fails to implement a net worth restoration plan accepted by the Board.</p>
<h4 class="subparagraph-head">(E) Critically undercapitalized</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">An insured credit union is &quot;critically undercapitalized&quot; if it has a net worth ratio <!-- PDFPage:945 -->of less than 2 percent (or such higher net worth ratio, not to exceed 3 percent, as the Board may specify by regulation).</p>
<h4 class="paragraph-head">(2) Adjusting net worth levels</h4>
<h4 class="subparagraph-head">(A) In general</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">If, for purposes of section 1831o(c) of this title, the Federal banking agencies increase or decrease the required minimum level for the leverage limit (as those terms are used in section 1831o of this title), the Board may, by regulation, and subject to subparagraph (B) of this paragraph, correspondingly increase or decrease 1 or more of the net worth ratios specified in subparagraphs (A) through (D) of paragraph (1) of this subsection in an amount that is equal to not more than the difference between the required minimum level most recently established by the Federal banking agencies and 4 percent of total assets (with respect to institutions regulated by those agencies).</p>
<h4 class="subparagraph-head">(B) Determinations required</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">The Board may increase or decrease net worth ratios under subparagraph (A) only if the Board&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-3em">(i) determines, in consultation with the Federal banking agencies, that the reason for the increase or decrease in the required minimum level for the leverage limit also justifies the adjustment in net worth ratios; and</p>
<p class="statutory-body-3em">(ii) determines that the resulting net worth ratios are sufficient to carry out the purpose of this section.</p>
<h4 class="subparagraph-head">(C) Transition period required</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">If the Board increases any net worth ratio under this paragraph, the Board shall give insured credit unions a reasonable period of time to meet the increased ratio.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(d) Risk-based net worth requirement for complex credit unions</h4>
<h4 class="paragraph-head">(1) In general</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">The regulations required under subsection (b)(1) shall include a risk-based net worth requirement for insured credit unions that are complex, as defined by the Board based on the portfolios of assets and liabilities of credit unions.</p>
<h4 class="paragraph-head">(2) Standard</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">The Board shall design the risk-based net worth requirement to take account of any material risks against which the net worth ratio required for an insured credit union to be adequately capitalized may not provide adequate protection.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(e) Earnings-retention requirement applicable to credit unions that are not well capitalized</h4>
<h4 class="paragraph-head">(1) In general</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">An insured credit union that is not well capitalized shall annually set aside as net worth an amount equal to not less than 0.4 percent of its total assets.</p>
<h4 class="paragraph-head">(2) Board's authority to decrease earnings-retention requirement</h4>
<h4 class="subparagraph-head">(A) In general</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">The Board may, by order, decrease the 0.4 percent requirement in paragraph (1) with respect to a credit union to the extent that the Board determines that the decrease&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-3em">(i) is necessary to avoid a significant redemption of shares; and</p>
<p class="statutory-body-3em">(ii) would further the purpose of this section.</p>
<h4 class="subparagraph-head">(B) Periodic review required</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">The Board shall periodically review any order issued under subparagraph (A).</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(f) Net worth restoration plan required</h4>
<h4 class="paragraph-head">(1) In general</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">Each insured credit union that is undercapitalized shall submit an acceptable net worth restoration plan to the Board within the time allowed under this subsection.</p>
<h4 class="paragraph-head">(2) Assistance to small credit unions</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">The Board (or the staff of the Board) shall, upon timely request by an insured credit union with total assets of less than $10,000,000, and subject to such regulations or guidelines as the Board may prescribe, assist that credit union in preparing a net worth restoration plan.</p>
<h4 class="paragraph-head">(3) Deadlines for submission and review of plans</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">The Board shall, by regulation, establish deadlines for submission of net worth restoration plans under this subsection that&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(A) provide insured credit unions with reasonable time to submit net worth restoration plans; and</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(B) require the Board to act on net worth restoration plans expeditiously.</p>
<h4 class="paragraph-head">(4) Failure to submit acceptable plan within time allowed</h4>
<h4 class="subparagraph-head">(A) Failure to submit any plan</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">If an insured credit union fails to submit a net worth restoration plan within the time allowed under paragraph (3), the Board shall&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-3em">(i) promptly notify the credit union of that failure; and</p>
<p class="statutory-body-3em">(ii) give the credit union a reasonable opportunity to submit a net worth restoration plan.</p>
<h4 class="subparagraph-head">(B) Submission of unacceptable plan</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">If an insured credit union submits a net worth restoration plan within the time allowed under paragraph (3), and the Board determines that the plan is not acceptable, the Board shall&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-3em">(i) promptly notify the credit union of why the plan is not acceptable; and</p>
<p class="statutory-body-3em">(ii) give the credit union a reasonable opportunity to submit a revised plan.</p>
<h4 class="paragraph-head">(5) Accepting plan</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">The Board may accept a net worth restoration plan only if the Board determines that the plan is based on realistic assumptions and is likely to succeed in restoring the net worth of the credit union.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(g) Restrictions on undercapitalized credit unions</h4>
<h4 class="paragraph-head">(1) Restriction on asset growth</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">An insured credit union that is undercapitalized shall not generally permit its average total assets to increase, unless&mdash;</p>
<!-- PDFPage:946 --><p class="statutory-body-2em">(A) the Board has accepted the net worth restoration plan of the credit union for that action;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(B) any increase in total assets is consistent with the net worth restoration plan; and</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(C) the net worth ratio of the credit union increases at a rate that is consistent with the net worth restoration plan.</p>
<h4 class="paragraph-head">(2) Restriction on member business loans</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">Notwithstanding section 1757a(a) of this title, an insured credit union that is undercapitalized may not make any increase in the total amount of member business loans (as defined in section 1757a(c) of this title) outstanding at that credit union at any one time, until such time as the credit union becomes adequately capitalized.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(h) More stringent treatment based on other supervisory criteria</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">With respect to the exercise of authority by the Board under regulations comparable to section 1831o(g) of this title&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(1) the Board may not reclassify an insured credit union into a lower net worth category, or treat an insured credit union as if it were in a lower net worth category, for reasons not pertaining to the safety and soundness of that credit union; and</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(2) the Board may not delegate its authority to reclassify an insured credit union into a lower net worth category or to treat an insured credit union as if it were in a lower net worth category.</p>

<h4 class="paragraph-head">(2) Periodic redeterminations required</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">Any determination by the Board under paragraph (1)(B) to take any action with respect to an insured credit union in lieu of appointing a conservator or liquidating agent shall cease to be effective not later than the end of the 180-day period beginning on the date on which the determination is made, and a conservator or liquidating agent shall be appointed for that credit union under paragraph (1)(A), unless the Board makes a new determination under paragraph (1)(B) before the end of the effective period of the prior determination.</p>
