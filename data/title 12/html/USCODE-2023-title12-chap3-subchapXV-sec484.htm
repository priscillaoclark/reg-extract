<h4 class="note-head">Codification</h4>
<p class="note-body">R.S. &sect;5240 derived from act June 3, 1864, ch. 106, &sect;54, 13 Stat. 116, which was part of the National Bank Act. See section 38 of this title.</p>
<p class="note-body">Section is comprised of sixth par. of R.S. &sect;5240, as amended. See Codification note set out under section 481 of this title.</p>
<p class="note-body">Section 412 of Pub. L. 97&ndash;320, set out in the credit of this section, was amended by section 23(a) of Pub. L. 97&ndash;457 to correct an error in the directory language of section 412 of Pub. L. 97&ndash;320. That amendment involved only directory language and not the content of the text being amended by Pub. L. 97&ndash;320 so no change in the text of this section resulted from the amendment by Pub. L. 97&ndash;457.</p>
