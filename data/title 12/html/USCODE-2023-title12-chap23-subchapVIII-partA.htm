<p class="statutory-body-2em">(A) shall guarantee the timely payment of principal and interest on the securities issued by a certified facility that represents interests solely in, or obligations fully backed by, any pool consisting solely of qualified loans which meet the applicable standards established under section 2279aa&ndash;8 of this title and which are held by such facility; and</p>

<h4 class="paragraph-head">(3) Power of Corporation</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">Notwithstanding any other provision of law, the Corporation is empowered, in connection with any guarantee under this subsection, whether before or after any default, to provide by contract with the facility for the extinguishment, on default by the facility, of any redemption, equitable, legal, or other right, title, or interest of the facility in any mortgage or mortgages constituting the pool against which the guaranteed securities are issued. With respect to any issue of guaranteed securities, in the event of default and pursuant otherwise to the terms of the contract, the mortgages that constitute such pool shall become the absolute property of the Corporation subject only to the unsatisfied rights of the holders of the securities based on and backed by such pool.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(b) Other responsibilities of and limitations on certified facilities</h4>

<h4 class="paragraph-head">(5) No discrimination against States with borrowers rights</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">The facility may not refuse to purchase qualified loans originating in States that have established borrowers rights laws either by statute or under the constitution of such States, except that the facility may require discounts or charge fees reasonably related to costs and expenses arising from such statutes or constitutional provisions.</p>

Securities issued under this section shall have maturities and bear rates of interest as determined by the Corporation.</p>
<h4 class="paragraph-head">(2) Issuance of debt obligations</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">The Corporation (and affiliates) may issue debt obligations solely for the purpose of obtaining amounts for the purchase of any securities under paragraph (1), for the purchase of qualified loans (as defined in section 2279aa of this title), and for maintaining reasonable amounts for business operations (including adequate liquidity) relating to activities under this subsection.</p>
<h4 class="paragraph-head">(3) Terms and limitations</h4>

<h4 class="subsection-head">(a) Federal laws</h4>
<h4 class="paragraph-head">(1) Applicability of certain Federal securities laws</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">For purposes of section 77c(a)(2) of title 15, no security representing an interest in, or obligations backed by, a pool of qualified loans for which guarantees have been provided by the Corporation shall be deemed to be a security issued or guaranteed by a person controlled or supervised by, or acting as an instrumentality of, the Government of the United States. No such security shall be deemed to be a &quot;government security&quot; for purposes of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 [15 U.S.C. 78a et seq.] or for purposes of the Investment Company Act of 1940 [15 U.S.C. 80a&ndash;1 et seq.].</p>
<h4 class="paragraph-head">(2) No full faith and credit of the United States</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">Each security for which credit enhancement has been provided by the Corporation shall clearly indicate that the security is not an obligation of, and is not guaranteed as to principal or interest by, the Farm Credit Administration, the United States, or any other agency or instrumentality of the United States (other than the Corporation).</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(b) State securities laws</h4>
<h4 class="paragraph-head">(1) General exemption</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">Any security or obligation that has been provided a guarantee by the Corporation shall be exempt from any law of any State with respect to or requiring registration or qualification of securities or real estate to the same extent as any obligation issued by, or guaranteed as to principal and interest by, the United States or any agency or instrumentality of the United States.</p>
<h4 class="paragraph-head">(2) State override</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">The provisions of paragraph (1) shall not be applicable to any State that, during the 8-year period beginning on January 6, 1988, enacts a law that&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(A) specifically refers to this subsection; and</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(B) expressly provides that paragraph (1) shall not apply to the State.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(c) Authorized investments</h4>
<h4 class="paragraph-head">(1) In general</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">Securities representing an interest in, or obligations backed by, pools of qualified loans with respect to which the Corporation has provided a guarantee shall be authorized investments of any person, trust, corporation, partnership, association, business trust, or business entity created pursuant to or existing under the laws of the United States or any State to the same extent that the person, trust, corporation, partnership, association, business trust, or business entity is authorized under any applicable law to purchase, hold, or invest in obligations issued by or guaranteed as to principal and interest by the United States or any agency or instrumentality of the United States. Such securities or obligations may be accepted as security for all fiduciary, trust, and public funds, the investment or deposits of which shall be under the authority and control of the United States or any State or any officers of either.</p>
<h4 class="paragraph-head">(2) State limitations on purchase, holding, or investment</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">If State law limits the purchase, holding, or investment in obligations issued by the United States by the person, trust, corporation, partnership, association, business trust, or business entity, securities or obligations of a certified facility issued on which the Corporation has provided a guarantee shall be considered to be obligations issued by the United States for purposes of the limitation.</p>
<h4 class="paragraph-head">(3) Nonapplicability of provisions</h4>
<h4 class="subparagraph-head">(A) Subsequent State law</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">Paragraphs (1) and (2) shall not apply with respect to a particular person, trust, corporation, partnership, association, business trust, or business entity, or class thereof, in any State that, prior to the expiration of the 8-year period beginning on January 6, 1988, enacts a law that specifically refers to this section and either prohibits or provides for a more limited authority to purchase, hold, or invest in the securities by any person, trust, corporation, partnership, association, business trust, or business entity, or class thereof, than is provided in paragraphs (1) and (2).</p>
<h4 class="subparagraph-head">(B) Effect of subsequent State law</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">The enactment by any State of a law of the type described in subparagraph (A) shall not affect the validity of any contractual commitment to purchase, hold, or invest that was made prior to the effective date of the law and shall not require the sale or other disposition of any securities acquired prior to the effective date of the law.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(d) State usury laws superseded</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">A provision of the Constitution or law of any State shall not apply to an agricultural loan made by an originator or a certified facility in accordance with this subchapter for sale to the Corporation or to a certified facility for inclusion in a pool for which the Corporation has provided, or has committed to provide, a guarantee, if the loan, not later than 180 days after the date the loan was made, is sold to the Corporation or included in a pool for which the Corporation has provided a guarantee, if the provision&mdash;</p>
