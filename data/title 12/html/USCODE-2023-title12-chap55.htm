<!-- field-start:statute -->
<h4 class="subsection-head">(a) Findings</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">Congress finds that&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(1) LIBOR is used as a benchmark rate in more than $200,000,000,000,000 worth of contracts worldwide;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(2) a significant number of existing contracts that reference LIBOR do not provide for the use of a clearly defined or practicable replacement benchmark rate when LIBOR is discontinued; and</p>
<!-- PDFPage:2024 --><p class="statutory-body-1em">(3) the cessation or nonrepresentativeness of LIBOR could result in disruptive litigation related to existing contracts that do not provide for the use of a clearly defined or practicable replacement benchmark rate.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(b) Purpose</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">It is the purpose of this chapter&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(1) to establish a clear and uniform process, on a nationwide basis, for replacing LIBOR in existing contracts the terms of which do not provide for the use of a clearly defined or practicable replacement benchmark rate, without affecting the ability of parties to use any appropriate benchmark rate in new contracts;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(2) to preclude litigation related to existing contracts the terms of which do not provide for the use of a clearly defined or practicable replacement benchmark rate;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(3) to allow existing contracts that reference LIBOR but provide for the use of a clearly defined and practicable replacement rate, to operate according to their terms; and</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(4) to address LIBOR references in Federal law.</p>
