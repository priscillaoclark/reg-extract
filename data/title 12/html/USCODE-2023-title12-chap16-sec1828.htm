<p class="statutory-body-1em">(B) in a form approved by the responsible agency,</p>

<p class="statutory-body">(4) <cap-smallcap>Reports on competitive factors.&mdash;</cap-smallcap></p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(A) <cap-smallcap>Request for report</cap-smallcap>.&mdash;In the interests of uniform standards and subject to subparagraph (B), before acting on any application for approval of a merger transaction, the responsible agency shall&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(i) request a report on the competitive factors involved from the Attorney General of the United States; and</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(ii) provide a copy of the request to the Corporation (when the Corporation is not the responsible agency).</p>
<br class="Q04" />
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(B) <cap-smallcap>Furnishing of report</cap-smallcap>.&mdash;The report requested under subparagraph (A) shall be furnished by the Attorney General to the responsible agency&mdash;</p>

<br class="Q04" />
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(C) <cap-smallcap>Exceptions</cap-smallcap>.&mdash;A responsible agency may not be required to request a report under subparagraph (A) if&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(i) the responsible agency finds that it must act immediately in order to prevent the probable failure of 1 of the insured depository institutions involved in the merger transaction; or</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(ii) the merger transaction involves solely an insured depository institution and 1 or more of the affiliates of such depository institution.</p>
<br class="Q04" />
<p class="statutory-body">(5) The responsible agency shall not approve&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(A) any proposed merger transaction which would result in a monopoly, or which would be in furtherance of any combination or conspiracy to monopolize or to attempt to monopolize the business of banking in any part of the United States, or</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(B) any other proposed merger transaction whose effect in any section of the country may be substantially to lessen competition, or to tend to create a monopoly, or which in any <!-- PDFPage:1111 -->other manner would be in restraint of trade, unless it finds that the anticompetitive effects of the proposed transaction are clearly outweighed in the public interest by the probable effect of the transaction in meeting the convenience and needs of the community to be served.</p>
<br class="Q04" />
<p class="statutory-body-block">In every case, the responsible agency shall take into consideration the financial and managerial resources and future prospects of the existing and proposed institutions, the convenience and needs of the community to be served, and the risk to the stability of the United States banking or financial system.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(6) The responsible agency shall immediately notify the Attorney General of any approval by it pursuant to this subsection of a proposed merger transaction. If the agency has found that it must act immediately to prevent the probable failure of one of the insured depository institutions involved, or if the proposed merger transaction is solely between an insured depository institution and 1 or more of its affiliates, and the report on the competitive factors has been dispensed with, the transaction may be consummated immediately upon approval by the agency. If the agency has advised the Attorney General under paragraph (4)(B)(ii) of the existence of an emergency requiring expeditious action and has requested a report on the competitive factors within 10 days, the transaction may not be consummated before the fifth calendar day after the date of approval by the agency. In all other cases, the transaction may not be consummated before the thirtieth calendar day after the date of approval by the agency or, if the agency has not received any adverse comment from the Attorney General of the United States relating to competitive factors, such shorter period of time as may be prescribed by the agency with the concurrence of the Attorney General, but in no event less than 15 calendar days after the date of approval.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(7)(A) Any action brought under the antitrust laws arising out of a merger transaction shall be commenced prior to the earliest time under paragraph (6) at which a merger transaction approved under paragraph (5) might be consummated. The commencement of such an action shall stay the effectiveness of the agency's approval unless the court shall otherwise specifically order. In any such action, the court shall review de novo the issues presented.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(B) In any judicial proceeding attacking a merger transaction approved under paragraph (5) on the ground that the merger transaction alone and of itself constituted a violation of any antitrust laws other than section 2 of title 15, the standards applied by the court shall be identical with those that the banking agencies are directed to apply under paragraph (5).</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(C) Upon the consummation of a merger transaction in compliance with this subsection and after the termination of any antitrust litigation commenced within the period prescribed in this paragraph, or upon the termination of such period if no such litigation is commenced therein, the transaction may not thereafter be attacked in any judicial proceeding on the ground that it alone and of itself constituted a violation of any antitrust laws other than section 2 of title 15, but nothing in this subsection shall exempt any bank or savings association resulting from a merger transaction from complying with the antitrust laws after the consummation of such transaction.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(D) In any action brought under the antitrust laws arising out of a merger transaction approved by a Federal supervisory agency pursuant to this subsection, such agency, and any State banking supervisory agency having jurisdiction within the State involved, may appear as a part of its own motion and as of right, and be represented by its counsel.</p>

<p class="statutory-body-1em">(A) the name and total resources of each bank or savings association involved;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(B) whether a report was submitted by the Attorney General under paragraph (4), and, if so, a summary by the Attorney General of the substance of such report; and</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(C) a statement by the responsible agency of the basis for its approval.</p>
<br class="Q04" />
<p class="statutory-body">(10) Until June 30, 1976, the responsible agency shall not grant any approval required by law which has the practical effect of permitting a conversion from the mutual to the stock form of organization, including approval of any application pending on the date of enactment of this subsection, except that this sentence shall not be deemed to limit now or hereafter the authority of the responsible agency to grant approvals in cases where the responsible agency finds that it must act in order to maintain the safety, soundness, and stability of an insured depository institution. The responsible agency may by rule, regulation, or otherwise and under such civil penalties (which shall be cumulative to any other remedies) as it may prescribe take whatever action it deems necessary or appropriate to implement or enforce this subsection.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(11) <cap-smallcap>Money laundering</cap-smallcap>.&mdash;In every case, the responsible agency, shall take into consideration the effectiveness of any insured depository institution involved in the proposed merger transaction in combatting money laundering activities, including in overseas branches.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(12) The provisions of this subsection do not apply to any merger transaction involving a foreign bank if no party to the transaction is principally engaged in business in the United States.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(13)(A) Except as provided in subparagraph (B), the responsible agency may not approve an application for an interstate merger transaction if the resulting insured depository institution (including all insured depository institutions which are affiliates of the resulting insured depository institution), upon consummation of the transaction, would control more than 10 percent of the total amount of deposits of insured depository institutions in the United States.</p>
