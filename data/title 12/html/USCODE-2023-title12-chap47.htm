<h4 class="subsection-head">(a) Findings</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">The Congress finds that&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(1) small business concerns are a vital part of the economy, accounting for the majority of new jobs, new products, and new services created in the United States;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(2) adequate access to debt capital is a critical component for small business development, productivity, expansion, and success in the United States;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(3) commercial banks are the most important suppliers of debt capital to small business concerns in the United States;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(4) commercial banks and other depository institutions have various incentives to minimize their risk in financing small business concerns;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(5) as a result of such incentives, many small business concerns with economically sound financing needs are unable to obtain access to needed debt capital;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(6) the small business capital access programs implemented by certain States are a flexible and efficient tool to assist financial institutions in providing access to needed debt capital for many small business concerns in a manner consistent with safety and soundness regulations;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(7) a small business capital access program would complement other programs which assist small business concerns in obtaining access to capital; and</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(8) Federal policy can stimulate and accelerate efforts by States to implement small business capital access programs by providing an incentive to States, while leaving the administration of such programs to each participating State.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(b) Purposes</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">By encouraging States to implement administratively efficient capital access programs that encourage commercial banks and other depository institutions to provide access to debt capital for a broad portfolio of small business concerns, and thereby promote a more efficient and effective debt market, the purposes of this subchapter are&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(1) to promote economic opportunity and growth;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(2) to create jobs;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(3) to promote economic efficiency;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(4) to enhance productivity; and</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(5) to spur innovation.</p>

<p class="statutory-body-2em">(C) may provide that if&mdash;</p>

<h4 class="subsection-head">(q) Termination clause</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">In each participation agreement, the participating State shall reserve for itself the ability to terminate its obligation to enroll loans under the Program. Any such termination shall be prospective only, and shall not apply to amounts of loans enrolled under the Program prior to such termination.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(r) Allowable withdrawals from fund</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">The participation agreement may provide that, if, for any consecutive period of not less than 24 months, the aggregate outstanding balance of all enrolled loans for a participating financial institution is continually less than the outstanding balance in the reserve fund for that participating financial institution, the participating State, in its discretion, may withdraw an amount from the reserve fund to bring the balance in the reserve fund down to the outstanding balance of all such enrolled loans.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(s) Grandfathered provision</h4>

<p class="statutory-body-1em">Notwithstanding subsection (b) or (d), the participation agreement, if explicitly authorized by a statute enacted by the State before September 23, 1994, may allow a participating financial institution to treat the premium charges paid by the participating financial institution and the borrower into the reserve fund, and interest or income earned on funds in the reserve fund that are deemed to be attributable to such premium charges, as assets of the participating financial institution for accounting purposes, subject to withdrawal by the participating financial institution only&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(A) for the payment of claims approved by the participating State in accordance with this section; and</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(B) upon the participating financial institution's withdrawal from authority to make new loans under the Program.</p>
<h4 class="paragraph-head">(2) Payment of post-withdrawal claims</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">After any withdrawal of assets from the reserve fund pursuant to paragraph (1)(B), any future claims filed by the participating financial institution on loans remaining in its capital access program portfolio shall only be paid from funds remaining in the reserve fund to the extent that, in the aggregate, such claims exceed the sum of the amount of such withdrawn assets, and interest on that amount, imputed at the same rate as income would have accrued had the amount not been withdrawn.</p>
<h4 class="paragraph-head">(3) Conditions for terminating special authority</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">If the Fund determines that the inclusion in a participation agreement of the provisions authorized by this subsection is resulting in the enrollment of loans under the Program that are likely to have been made without assistance provided under this subchapter, the Fund may notify the participating State that henceforth, the Fund will only make reimbursements to the State under section 4747 of this title with respect to a loan if the participation agreement between the participating State and each participating financial institution has been amended to conform with this section, without exercise of the special authority granted by this subsection.</p>
