<p class="statutory-body">The Congress finds that&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(1) many financial institutions engage daily in thousands of transactions with other financial institutions directly and through clearing organizations;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(2) the efficient processing of such transactions is essential to a smoothly functioning economy;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(3) such transactions can be processed most efficiently if, consistent with applicable contractual terms, obligations among financial institutions are netted;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(4) such netting procedures would reduce the systemic risk within the banking system and financial markets; and</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(5) the effectiveness of such netting procedures can be assured only if they are recognized as valid and legally binding in the event of the closing of a financial institution participating in the netting procedures.</p>
