<p class="statutory-body-2em">(E) Whether the depositor is permitted to make more than a minimal number of withdrawals from the account each month by any means described in subparagraph (D) or any other means.</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(F) Whether a monthly statement itemizing all transactions for the monthly reporting period is made available to the depositor with respect to such account or a passbook is provided in which all transactions with respect to such account are recorded.</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(G) Whether depositors are permitted access to tellers at the institution for conducting transactions with respect to such account.</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(H) Whether other account relationships with the institution are required in order to open any such account.</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(I) Whether individuals are required to meet any prerequisite which discriminates against low-income individuals in order to open such account.</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(J) Such other factors as the Corporation may determine to be appropriate.</p>
