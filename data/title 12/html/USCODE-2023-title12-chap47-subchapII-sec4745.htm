<p class="statutory-body-2em">(B) is an early loan, such payment shall not be deemed fully to satisfy the claim of the participating financial institution, and at such time as the remaining balance of the claim does not exceed 75 percent of the balance in the reserve fund, the participating State shall, upon the request of the participating financial institution, pay any remaining amount of the claim.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(n) Denial of claims</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">A participating State may deny a claim if a representation or warranty made by the participating financial institution to the participating State at the time that the loan was filed for enrollment or at the time that the claim was submitted was known by the participating financial institution to be false.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(o) Subsequent recovery of claim amount</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">If, subsequent to payment of a claim by the participating State, a participating financial institution recovers from a borrower any amount for which payment of the claim was made, the participating financial institution shall promptly pay to the participating State for deposit into the reserve fund the amount recovered, less any expenses incurred by the institution in collection of such amount.</p>

<p class="statutory-body-2em">(C) may provide that if&mdash;</p>

<!-- PDFPage:1759 --><h4 class="paragraph-head">(2) Definitions</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">For purposes of this subsection, the terms &quot;executive officer&quot;, &quot;director&quot;, &quot;principal shareholder&quot;, &quot;immediate family&quot;, and &quot;related interest&quot; refer to the same relationship to a participating financial institution as the relationship described in part 215 of title 12 of the Code of Federal Regulations, or any successor to such part.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(q) Termination clause</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">In each participation agreement, the participating State shall reserve for itself the ability to terminate its obligation to enroll loans under the Program. Any such termination shall be prospective only, and shall not apply to amounts of loans enrolled under the Program prior to such termination.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(r) Allowable withdrawals from fund</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">The participation agreement may provide that, if, for any consecutive period of not less than 24 months, the aggregate outstanding balance of all enrolled loans for a participating financial institution is continually less than the outstanding balance in the reserve fund for that participating financial institution, the participating State, in its discretion, may withdraw an amount from the reserve fund to bring the balance in the reserve fund down to the outstanding balance of all such enrolled loans.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(s) Grandfathered provision</h4>
<h4 class="paragraph-head">(1) Special treatment of premium charges</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">Notwithstanding subsection (b) or (d), the participation agreement, if explicitly authorized by a statute enacted by the State before September 23, 1994, may allow a participating financial institution to treat the premium charges paid by the participating financial institution and the borrower into the reserve fund, and interest or income earned on funds in the reserve fund that are deemed to be attributable to such premium charges, as assets of the participating financial institution for accounting purposes, subject to withdrawal by the participating financial institution only&mdash;</p>

<p class="statutory-body-1em">After any withdrawal of assets from the reserve fund pursuant to paragraph (1)(B), any future claims filed by the participating financial institution on loans remaining in its capital access program portfolio shall only be paid from funds remaining in the reserve fund to the extent that, in the aggregate, such claims exceed the sum of the amount of such withdrawn assets, and interest on that amount, imputed at the same rate as income would have accrued had the amount not been withdrawn.</p>
<h4 class="paragraph-head">(3) Conditions for terminating special authority</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">If the Fund determines that the inclusion in a participation agreement of the provisions authorized by this subsection is resulting in the enrollment of loans under the Program that are likely to have been made without assistance provided under this subchapter, the Fund may notify the participating State that henceforth, the Fund will only make reimbursements to the State under section 4747 of this title with respect to a loan if the participation agreement between the participating State and each participating financial institution has been amended to conform with this section, without exercise of the special authority granted by this subsection.</p>
