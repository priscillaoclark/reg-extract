<p class="statutory-body-1em">(2) The period during which such annual percentage yield is in effect.</p>

<p class="statutory-body-1em">(1) in order to avoid fees or service charges for any period&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(A) a minimum balance must be maintained in the account during such period; or</p>
