<p class="statutory-body-2em">(A) establish the capital classifications specified under paragraph (2) for the Federal Home Loan Banks;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(B) establish criteria for each such capital classification based on the amount and types of capital held by a bank and the risk-based, minimum, and critical capital levels for the banks and taking due consideration of the capital classifications established under subsection (a) for the enterprises, with such modifications as the Director determines to be appropriate to reflect the difference in operations between the banks and the enterprises; and</p>

<p class="statutory-body-2em">(B) after notice and an opportunity for hearing, the Director determines that the regulated entity is in an unsafe or unsound condition; or</p>
<!-- PDFPage:1692 --><p class="statutory-body-2em">(C) pursuant to section 4631(b) of this title, the Director deems the regulated entity to be engaging in an unsafe or unsound practice.</p>
<h4 class="paragraph-head">(2) Reclassification</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">In addition to any other action authorized under this chapter, including the reclassification of a regulated entity for any reason not specified in this subsection, if the Director takes any action described in paragraph (1), the Director may classify a regulated entity&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(A) as undercapitalized, if the regulated entity is otherwise classified as adequately capitalized;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(B) as significantly undercapitalized, if the regulated entity is otherwise classified as undercapitalized; and</p>

<h4 class="paragraph-head">(1) In general</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">A regulated entity shall make no capital distribution if, after making the distribution, the regulated entity would be undercapitalized.</p>
<h4 class="paragraph-head">(2) Exception</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">Notwithstanding paragraph (1), the Director may permit a regulated entity, to the extent appropriate or applicable, to repurchase, redeem, retire, or otherwise acquire shares or ownership interests if the repurchase, redemption, retirement, or other acquisition&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(A) is made in connection with the issuance of additional shares or obligations of the regulated entity in at least an equivalent amount; and</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(B) will reduce the financial obligations of the regulated entity or otherwise improve the financial condition of the entity.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(f) Implementation</h4>
