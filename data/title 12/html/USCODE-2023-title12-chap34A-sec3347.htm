<p class="statutory-body-1em">(1) has policies, practices, funding, staffing, and procedures that are consistent with this chapter;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(2) processes complaints and completes investigations in a reasonable time period;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(3) appropriately disciplines sanctioned appraisers and appraisal management companies;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(4) maintains an effective regulatory program; and</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(5) reports complaints and disciplinary actions on a timely basis to the national registries on appraisers and appraisal management companies maintained by the Appraisal Subcommittee.</p>
<br class="Q04" />
<p class="statutory-body-block">The Appraisal Subcommittee shall have the authority to remove a State licensed or certified appraiser or a registered appraisal management company from a national registry on an interim basis, not to exceed 90 days, pending State agency action on licensing, certification, registration, and disciplinary proceedings. The Appraisal Subcommittee and all agencies, instrumentalities, and Federally recognized entities under this chapter shall not recognize appraiser certifications and licenses from States whose appraisal policies, practices, funding, staffing, or procedures are found to be inconsistent with this chapter. The Appraisal Subcommittee shall have the authority to impose sanctions, as described in this section, against a State agency that fails to have an effective appraiser regulatory program. In determining whether such a program is effective, the Appraisal Subcommittee shall include an analysis of the licensing and certification of appraisers, the registration of appraisal management companies, the issuance of temporary licenses and certifications for appraisers, the receiving and tracking of submitted complaints against appraisers and appraisal management companies, the investigation of complaints, and enforcement actions against appraisers and appraisal management companies. The Appraisal Subcommittee shall have the authority to impose interim actions and suspensions against a State agency as an alternative to, or in advance of, the derecognition of a State agency.</p>

<p class="statutory-body-1em">(1) the State agency fails to recognize and enforce the standards, requirements, and procedures prescribed pursuant to this chapter;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(2) the State agency is not granted authority or sufficient funding by the State which is adequate to permit the agency to carry out its functions under this chapter; or</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(3) decisions concerning appraisal standards, appraiser qualifications and supervision of appraiser practices are not made in a manner that carries out the purposes of this chapter.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(c) Rejection of State certifications and licenses</h4>
<h4 class="paragraph-head">(1) Opportunity to be heard or correct conditions</h4>

<h4 class="paragraph-head">(2) Adoption of procedures</h4>
