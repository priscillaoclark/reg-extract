<h4 class="subsection-head">(a) Reports of condition</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">(1) Each insured credit union shall make reports of condition to the Board upon dates which shall be selected by it. Such reports of condition shall be in such form and shall contain such information as the Board may require. The reporting dates selected for reports of condition shall be the same for all insured credit unions except that when any of said reporting dates is a nonbusiness day for any credit union the preceding business day shall be its reporting date. The total amount of the member accounts of each insured credit union as of each reporting date shall be reported in such reports of condition in accordance with regulations prescribed by the Board. Each report of condition shall contain a declaration by the president, by a vice president, by the treasurer, or by any other officer designated by the board of directors of the reporting credit union to make such declaration, that the report is true and correct to the best of such officer's knowledge and belief. Unless such requirement is waived by the Board, the correctness of each report of condition shall be attested by the signatures of three of the officers of the reporting credit union with the declaration that the report has been examined by them and to the best of their knowledge and belief is true and correct.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(2) The Board may call for such other reports as it may from time to time require.</p>
<!-- PDFPage:887 --><p class="statutory-body">(3) The Board may require reports of condition to be published in such manner, not inconsistent with any applicable law, as it may direct. Any insured credit union which maintains procedures reasonably adapted to avoid any inadvertent error and, unintentionally and as a result of such an error, fails to submit or publish any report required under this subsection or section 1756 of this title, within the period of time specified by the Board, or submits or publishes any false or misleading report or information, or inadvertently transmits or publishes any report which is minimally late, shall be subject to a penalty of not more than $2,000 for each day during which such failure continues or such false or misleading information is not corrected. The insured credit union shall have the burden of proving that an error was inadvertent and that a report was inadvertently transmitted or published late. Any insured credit union which fails to submit or publish any report required under this subsection or section 1756 of this title, within the period of time specified by the Board, or submits or publishes any false or misleading report or information, in a manner not described in the 2nd preceding sentence shall be subject to a penalty of not more than $20,000 for each day during which such failure continues or such false or misleading information is not corrected. Notwithstanding the preceding sentence, if any insured credit union knowingly or with reckless disregard for the accuracy of any information or report described in such sentence submits or publishes any false or misleading report or information, the Board may assess a penalty of not more than $1,000,000 or 1 percent of total assets of such credit union, whichever is less, per day for each day during which such failure continues or such false or misleading information is not corrected. Any penalty imposed under any of the 4 preceding sentences shall be assessed and collected by the Board in the manner provided in section 1786(k)(2) of this title (for penalties imposed under such section) and any such assessment (including the determination of the amount of the penalty) shall be subject to the provisions of such section. Any insured credit union against which any penalty is assessed under this subsection shall be afforded an agency hearing if such insured credit union submits a request for such hearing within 20 days after the issuance of the notice of assessment. Section 1786(j) of this title shall apply to any proceeding under this subsection.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(4) The Board may accept any report of condition made to any commission, board, or authority having supervision of a State-chartered credit union and may furnish to any such commission, board, or authority reports of condition made to the Board.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(5) Reports required under subchapter I of this chapter shall be so prepared that they can be used for share insurance purposes. To the maximum extent feasible, the Board shall use for insurance purposes reports submitted to State regulatory agencies by State-chartered credit unions.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(6) <cap-smallcap>Audit requirement.&mdash;</cap-smallcap></p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(A) <cap-smallcap>In general</cap-smallcap>.&mdash;Before the end of the 120-day period beginning on August 9, 1989, and notwithstanding any other provision of Federal or State law, the Board shall prescribe, by regulation, audit standards which require an outside, independent audit of any insured credit union by a certified public accountant for any fiscal year (of such credit union)&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(i) for which such credit union has not conducted an annual supervisory committee audit;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(ii) for which such credit union has not received a complete and satisfactory supervisory committee audit; or</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(iii) during which such credit union has experienced persistent and serious recordkeeping deficiencies, as determined by the Board.</p>
<br class="Q04" />
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(B) <cap-smallcap>Unsafe or unsound practice</cap-smallcap>.&mdash;The Board may treat the failure of any insured credit union to obtain an outside, independent audit for any fiscal year for which such audit is required under subparagraph (A) or (D) as an unsafe or unsound practice within the meaning of section 1786(b) of this title.</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(C) <cap-smallcap>Accounting principles.&mdash;</cap-smallcap></p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(i) <cap-smallcap>In general</cap-smallcap>.&mdash;Accounting principles applicable to reports or statements required to be filed with the Board by each insured credit union shall be uniform and consistent with generally accepted accounting principles.</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(ii) <cap-smallcap>Board determination</cap-smallcap>.&mdash;If the Board determines that the application of any generally accepted accounting principle to any insured credit union is not appropriate, the Board may prescribe an accounting principle for application to the credit union that is no less stringent than generally accepted accounting principles.</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(iii) <cap-smallcap>De minimus&#160;<sup><a href="#1782_1_target" name="1782_1">1</a></sup></cap-smallcap> exception.&mdash;This subparagraph shall not apply to any insured credit union, the total assets of which are less than $10,000,000, unless prescribed by the Board or an appropriate State credit union supervisor.</p>

<p class="statutory-body-2em">(ii) <cap-smallcap>Voluntary audits</cap-smallcap>.&mdash;If a Federal credit union that is not required to conduct an audit under clause (i), and that has total assets of more than $10,000,000 conducts such an audit for any purpose, using an independent auditor who is compensated for his or her audit services with respect to that audit, the audit shall be performed consistent with the accountancy laws of the appropriate State or jurisdiction, including licensing requirements.</p>
<br class="Q04" />
<p class="statutory-body">(7) <cap-smallcap>Report to independent auditor.&mdash;</cap-smallcap></p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(A) <cap-smallcap>In general</cap-smallcap>.&mdash;Each insured credit union which has engaged the services of an inde<!-- PDFPage:888 -->pendent auditor to audit such depository institution within the past 2 years shall transmit to such auditor a copy of the most recent report of condition made by such credit union (pursuant to this chapter or any other provision of law) and a copy of the most recent report of examination received by such credit union.</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(B) <cap-smallcap>Additional information</cap-smallcap>.&mdash;In addition to the copies of the reports required to be provided to an auditor under subparagraph (A), each insured credit union shall provide such auditor with&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(i) a copy of any supervisory memorandum of understanding with such credit union and any written agreement between the Board or a State regulatory agency and the credit union which is in effect during the period covered by the audit; and</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(ii) a report of any action initiated or taken by the Board during such period under subsection (e), (f), (g), (i), (l), or (q) of section 1786 of this title, or any similar action taken by a State regulatory agency under State law, or any other civil money penalty assessed by the Board under this chapter, with respect to&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-3em">(I) the credit union; or</p>
<p class="statutory-body-3em">(II) any institution-affiliated party.</p>
<br class="Q04" />
<p class="statutory-body">(8) <cap-smallcap>Data sharing with other agencies and persons</cap-smallcap>.&mdash;In addition to reports of examination, reports of condition, and other reports required to be regularly provided to the Board (with respect to all insured credit unions, including a credit union for which the Corporation has been appointed conservator or liquidating agent) or an appropriate State commission, board, or authority having supervision of a State-chartered credit union, the Board may, in the discretion of the Board, furnish any report of examination or other confidential supervisory information concerning any credit union or other entity examined by the Board under authority of any Federal law, to&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(A) any other Federal or State agency or authority with supervisory or regulatory authority over the credit union or other entity;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(B) any officer, director, or receiver of such credit union or entity; and</p>

No action or proceeding shall be brought for the recovery of any deposit or premium charge due to the fund, or for the recovery of any amount paid to the fund in excess of the amount due it, unless such action or proceeding shall have been brought within five years after the right accrued for which the claim is made. Where the insured credit union has made or filed with the Board a false or fraudulent certified statement with the intent to evade, in whole or in part, the payment of its deposit or any premium charge, the claim shall not be deemed to have accrued until the discovery by the Board of the fact that the certified statement is false or fraudulent.</p>

Whether or not the penalty provided in this subsection has been incurred shall be determined and adjudged by any court of the United States of competent jurisdiction in a suit brought for that purpose in the district or territory in which the principal office of such credit union is located, under direction of and by the Board in its own name, before the credit union shall be declared dissolved. The remedies provided in this subsection and in subsections (d) and (e) of this section shall not be construed as limiting any other remedies against any insured credit union but shall be in addition thereto.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(g) Records</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">Each insured credit union shall maintain such records as will readily permit verification of the correctness of its reports of condition, certified statements, and deposit and premium charges for insurance. However, no insured credit union shall be required to retain such records for such purpose for a period in excess of five years from the date of the making of any such report, the filing of any such statement, or the payment of any deposit or adjustment thereof or any premium charge, except that when there is a dispute between the insured credit union and the Board over the amount of any deposit or adjustment thereof or any premium charge for insur<!-- PDFPage:891 -->ance the credit union shall retain such records until final determination of the issue.</p>

<!-- field-end:head -->
<!-- field-start:statute -->
<h4 class="subsection-head">(a) Creation; use of fund</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">There is hereby created in the Treasury of the United States a National Credit Union Share Insurance Fund which shall be used by the Board as a revolving fund for carrying out the purposes of this subchapter. Money in the fund shall be available upon requisition by the Board, without fiscal year limitation, for making payments of insurance under section 1787 of this title, for providing assistance and making expenditures under section 1788 of this title in connection with the liquidation or threatened liquidation of insured credit unions, and for such administrative and other expenses incurred in carrying out the purposes of this subchapter as it may determine to be proper.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(b) Deposit of deposits and premium charges, fees and penalties</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">All deposits and premium charges for insurance paid pursuant to the provisions of section 1782 of this title and all fees for examinations and all penalties collected by the Board under any provision of this subchapter shall be deposited in the National Credit Union Share Insurance Fund. The Board shall report annually to the Committee on Banking, Housing, and Urban Affairs of the Senate and the Committee on Banking, Finance and Urban Affairs of the House of Representatives with respect to the operating level of the fund. Such report shall also include the results of an independent audit of the fund.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(c) Investment authorization</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">The Board may authorize the Secretary of the Treasury to invest and reinvest such portions of the fund as the Board may determine are not needed for current operations in any interest-bearing securities of the United States or in any securities guaranteed as to both principal and interest by the United States or in bonds or other obligations which are lawful investments for fiduciary, trust, and public funds of the United States, and the income therefrom shall constitute a part of the fund.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(d) Loans to fund, limitation and terms; interest accrual; determination of interest rate</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">(1) If, in the judgment of the Board, a loan to the insurance fund, or to the stabilization fund described in section 1790e of this title, is required at any time for purposes of this subchapter,<sup><a href="#1783_1_target" name="1783_1">1</a></sup> the Secretary of the Treasury shall make the loan, but loans under this paragraph shall not exceed in the aggregate $6,000,000,000 outstanding at any one time. Except as otherwise provided in this subsection, section 1790e of this title, and in subsection (e) of this section, each loan under this paragraph shall be made on such terms as may be fixed by agreement between the Board and the Secretary of the Treasury.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(2) Interest shall accrue to the Treasury on the amount of any outstanding loans made to the fund pursuant to paragraph (1) of this subsection on the basis of the average daily amount of such outstanding loans determined at the close of each fiscal year with respect to such year, and the Board shall pay the interest so accruing into the Treasury as miscellaneous receipts annually from the fund. The Secretary of the Treasury shall determine the applicable interest rate in advance by calculating the average yield to maturity (on the basis of daily closing market bid quotations during the month of September of the preceding fiscal year) on outstanding marketable public debt obligations of the United States having a maturity date of five or less years from the first day of such month of September and by adjusting such yield to the nearest one-eighth of 1 per centum.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(3) For the purpose of making loans under paragraph (1) of this subsection, the Secretary of the Treasury is authorized to use as a public debt transaction the proceeds of the sale of any securities issued under chapter 31 of title 31, and the purposes for which securities may be issued under chapter 31 of title 31 are hereby extended to include such loans. All loans and repayments under this section shall be treated as public debt transactions of the United States.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(4) <cap-smallcap>Temporary increases authorized.&mdash;</cap-smallcap></p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(A) <cap-smallcap>Recommendations for increase</cap-smallcap>.&mdash;During the period beginning on May 20, 2009, and ending on December 31, 2010, if, upon the written recommendation of the Board (upon a vote of not less than two-thirds of the members of the Board) and the Board of Governors of the Federal Reserve System (upon a vote of not less than two-thirds of the members of such Board), the Secretary of the Treasury (in consultation with the President) determines that additional amounts above the $6,000,000,000 amount specified in paragraph (1) are necessary, such amount shall be increased to the <!-- PDFPage:894 -->amount so determined to be necessary, not to exceed $30,000,000,000.</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(B) <cap-smallcap>Report required</cap-smallcap>.&mdash;If the borrowing authority of the Board is increased above $6,000,000,000 pursuant to subparagraph (A), the Board shall promptly submit a report to the Committee on Banking, Housing, and Urban Affairs of the Senate and the Committee on Financial Services of the House of Representatives describing the reasons and need for the additional borrowing authority and its intended uses.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(e) Excess funds credited against loans</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">So long as any loans to the fund are outstanding, the Board shall from time to time, not less often than annually, determine whether the balance in the fund is in excess of the amount which, in its judgment, is needed to meet the requirements of the fund and shall pay such excess to the Secretary of the Treasury, to be credited against the loans to the fund.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(f) Authorization for fund to borrow from Central Liquidity Facility</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">In addition to the authority to borrow from the Secretary of the Treasury provided in subsection (d), if in the judgment of the Board, a loan to the fund is required at any time for carrying out the purposes of this subchapter, the fund is authorized to borrow from the National Credit Union Administration Central Liquidity Facility.</p>

Such court may issue an order requiring such person to appear before the Board, or before a person designated by it, there to produce records, if so ordered, or to give testimony touching the matter in question. Any failure to obey such order of the court may be punished by such court as a contempt thereof. All process in any such case may be served in the judicial district whereof such person is an inhabitant or carries on business or wherever he may be found. No person shall be excused from attending and testifying or from producing books, records, or other papers in obedience to a subpena issued under the authority of this subchapter on the ground that the testimony or evidence, documentary or otherwise, required of him may tend to incriminate him or subject him to penalty or forfeiture, but no individual shall be prosecuted or subject to any penalty or forfeiture for or on account of any transaction, matter, or thing concerning which he is compelled to testify or produce evidence, documentary or otherwise, after having claimed his privilege against self-incrimination, except that such individual so testifying shall not be exempt from prosecution and punishment for perjury committed in so testifying.</p>

<p class="statutory-body">(2) If the rate prescribed in paragraph (1) exceeds the rate such credit union would be permitted to charge in the absence of this subsection, and such State fixed rate is thereby preempted by the rate described in paragraph (1), the taking, receiving, reserving, or charging a greater rate than is allowed by paragraph (1), when knowingly done, shall be deemed a forfeiture of the entire interest which the loan carries with it, or which has been agreed to be paid thereon. If such greater rate of interest has been <!-- PDFPage:900 -->paid, the person who paid it may recover, in a civil action commenced in a court of appropriate jurisdiction not later than two years after the date of such payment, an amount equal to twice the amount of interest paid from the credit union taking or receiving such interest.</p>

<!-- field-end:head -->
<!-- field-start:statute -->
<h4 class="subsection-head">(a) Termination of insurance</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">(1) Any insured credit union other than a Federal credit union may, upon not less than ninety days&apos; written notice to the Board and upon the affirmative vote of a majority of its members <!-- PDFPage:902 -->within one year prior to the giving of such notice, terminate its status as an insured credit union.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(2) Any insured credit union, other than a Federal credit union, which has obtained a new certificate of insurance from a corporation authorized and duly licensed to insure member accounts may upon not less than ninety days&apos; written notice to the Board convert from status as an insured credit union under this chapter: <i>Provided</i>, That at the time of giving notice to the Board the provisions of paragraph (b)(1) of this section are not being invoked against the credit union.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(b) Unsound condition of credit union; notice to correct condition; hearing; judicial review</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">(1) Whenever, in the opinion of the Board, any insured credit union is engaging or has engaged in unsafe or unsound practices in conducting the business of such credit union, or is in an unsafe or unsound condition to continue operations as an insured credit union, or is violating or has violated an applicable law, rule, regulation, order, or any condition imposed in writing by the Board in connection with any action on any application, notice, or other request by the credit union or institution-affiliated party,,&#160;<sup><a href="#1786_1_target" name="1786_1">1</a></sup> or is violating or has violated any written agreement entered into with the Board, the Board shall serve upon the credit union a statement with respect to such practices or conditions or violations for the purpose of securing the correction thereof. In the case of an insured State-chartered credit union, the Board shall send a copy of such statement to the commission, board, or authority, if any, having supervision of such credit union. Unless such correction shall be made within one hundred and twenty days after service of such statement, or within such shorter period of not less than twenty days after such service as the Board shall require in any case where it determines that the insurance risk with respect to such credit union could be unduly jeopardized by further delay in the correction of such practices or conditions or violations, or as the commission, board, or authority having supervision of such credit union, if any, shall require in the case of an insured State-chartered credit union, the Board, if it shall determine to proceed further, shall give to the credit union not less than thirty days&apos; written notice of its intention to terminate the status of the credit union as an insured credit union. Such notice shall contain a statement of the facts constituting the alleged unsafe and unsound practices or conditions or violations and shall fix a time and place for a hearing thereon. Such hearing shall be fixed for a date not earlier than thirty days nor later than sixty days after service of such notice unless an earlier or a later date is set by the Board at the request of the credit union. Unless the credit union shall appear at the hearing by a duly authorized representative, it shall be deemed to have consented to the termination of its status as an insured credit union. In the event of such consent, or if upon the record made at any such hearing the Board shall find that any unsafe or unsound practice or condition or violation specified in the notice has been established and has not been corrected within the time above-prescribed in which to make such correction, the Board may issue and serve upon the credit union an order terminating its status as an insured credit union on a date subsequent to the date of such finding and subsequent to the expiration of the time specified in the notice.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(2) Any credit union whose insured status has been terminated by order of the Board under this subsection shall have the right of judicial review of such order only to the same extent as provided for the review of orders under subsection (j) of this section.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(c) Notice to members of termination of insured status</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">In the event of the termination of a credit union's status as an insured credit union as provided under subsection (a)(1) or (b) of this section, the credit union shall give prompt and reasonable notice to all of its members whose accounts are insured that it has ceased to be an insured credit union. It may include in such notice a statement of the fact that member accounts insured on the effective date of such termination, to the extent not withdrawn, remain insured for one year from the date of such termination, but it shall not further represent itself in any manner as an insured credit union. In the event of failure to give the notice as herein provided to members whose accounts are insured, the Board is authorized to give reasonable notice.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(d) Continuation of insurance for one year; approval of conversion of status; procedure subsequent to approval; reduction of premium charges</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">(1) After the termination of the insured status of any credit union as provided under subsection (a)(1) or (b) of this section, insurance of its member accounts to the extent that they were insured on the effective date of such termination, less any amounts thereafter withdrawn which reduce the accounts below the amount covered by insurance on the effective date of such termination, shall continue for a period of one year, but no shares issued by the credit union or deposits made after the date of such termination shall be insured by the Board. The credit union shall continue to maintain its deposit with and pay premiums to the Board during such period as in the case of an insured credit union and the Board shall have the right to examine such credit union from time to time during the period during which such insurance continues. Such credit union shall, in all other respects, be subject to the duties and obligations of an insured credit union for the period of one year from the date of such termination. In the event that such credit union shall be closed for liquidation within such period of one year, the Board shall have the same powers and rights with respect to such credit union as in the case of an insured credit union. Notwithstanding the above, when an insured credit union's insured status is terminated and the credit union subsequently obtains comparable insurance coverage from another source, insurance of its accounts by the fund may cease immediately upon the ef<!-- PDFPage:903 -->fective date of such comparable coverage by mutual consent of the credit union and the Board.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(2) No credit union shall convert from status as an insured credit union under this chapter as provided under subsection (a)(2) of this section until the proposition for such conversion has been approved by a majority of all the directors of the credit union, and by affirmative vote of a majority of the members of the credit union who vote on the proposition in a vote in which at least 20 per centum of the total membership of the credit union participates. Following approval by the directors, written notice of the proposition and of the date set for the membership vote shall be delivered in person to each member, or mailed to each member at the address for such member appearing on the records of the credit union, not more than thirty nor less than seven days prior to such date. The membership shall be given the opportunity to vote by mail ballot. If the proposition is approved by the membership, prompt and reasonable notice of insurance conversion shall be given to all members.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(3) In the event of a conversion of a credit union from status as an insured credit union under this chapter as provided under subsection (a)(2) of this section, premium charges payable under section 1782(c) of this title shall be reduced by an amount proportionate to the number of calendar months for which the converting credit union will no longer be insured under this chapter. As long as a converting credit union remains insured under this chapter, it shall remain subject to all of the provisions of this subchapter.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(e) Opinion of Board as to unsound condition of credit union; notice of charges; hearing; order to cease and desist; judicial review</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">(1) If, in the opinion of the Board, any insured credit union, credit union which has insured accounts, or any institution-affiliated party is engaging or has engaged, or the Board has reasonable cause to believe that the credit union or any institution-affiliated party is about to engage, in an unsafe or unsound practice in conducting the business of such credit union, or is violating or has violated, or the Board has reasonable cause to believe that the credit union or any institution-affiliated party is about to violate, a law, rule, or regulation, or any condition imposed in writing by the Board in connection with the granting of any application or other request by the credit union or any written agreement entered into with the Board, the Board may issue and serve upon the credit union or such party a notice of charges in respect thereof. The notice shall contain a statement of the facts constituting the alleged violation or violations or the unsafe or unsound practice or practices, and shall fix a time and place at which a hearing will be held to determine whether an order to cease and desist therefrom should issue against the credit union or the institution-affiliated party. Such hearing shall be fixed for a date not earlier than thirty days nor later than sixty days after service of such notice unless an earlier or a later date is set by the Board at the request of any party so served. Unless the party or parties so served shall appear at the hearing by a duly authorized representative, they shall be deemed to have consented to the issuance of the cease-and-desist order. In the event of such consent, or if upon the record made at any such hearing, the Board shall find that any violation or unsafe or unsound practice specified in the notice of charges has been established, the Board may issue and serve upon the credit union or the institution-affiliated party an order to cease and desist from any such violation or practice. Such order may, by provisions which may be mandatory or otherwise, require the credit union or its institution-affiliated parties to cease and desist from the same, and, further, to take affirmative action to correct the conditions resulting from any such violation or practice.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(2) A cease-and-desist order shall become effective at the expiration of thirty days after the service of such order upon the credit union or other person concerned (except in the case of a cease-and-desist order issued upon consent, which shall become effective at the time specified therein), and shall remain effective and enforceable as provided therein, except to such extent as it is stayed, modified, terminated, or set aside by action of the Board or a reviewing court.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(3) <cap-smallcap>Affirmative action to correct conditions resulting from violations or practices</cap-smallcap>.&mdash;The authority to issue an order under this subsection and subsection (f) which requires an insured credit union or any institution-affiliated party to take affirmative action to correct any conditions resulting from any violation or practice with respect to which such order is issued includes the authority to require such insured credit union or such party to&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(A) make restitution or provide reimbursement, indemnification, or guarantee against loss if&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(i) such credit union or such party was unjustly enriched in connection with such violation or practice; or</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(ii) the violation or practice involved a reckless disregard for the law or any applicable regulations or prior order of the Board;</p>
<br class="Q04" />
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(B) restrict the growth of the institution;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(C) rescind agreements or contracts;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(D) dispose of any loan or asset involved;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(E) employ qualified officers or employees (who may be subject to approval by the Board at the direction of such Board); and</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(F) take such other action as the Board determines to be appropriate.</p>
<br class="Q04" />

<h4 class="subsection-head">(a) Loans; purchase of assets; accounts; agreements affecting interest of Board in any asset acquired by it</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">(1) In order to reopen a closed insured credit union or in order to prevent the closing of an insured credit union which the Board has determined is in danger of closing or in order to assist in the voluntary liquidation of a solvent credit union, the Board, in its discretion, is authorized to make loans to, or purchase the assets of, or establish accounts in such insured credit union upon such terms and conditions as it may prescribe. Except with respect to the voluntary liquidation of a solvent credit union, such loans shall be made and such accounts shall be established only when, in the opinion of the Board, such action is necessary to protect the fund or the interests of the members of the credit union.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(2) Whenever in the judgment of the Board such action will reduce the risk or avert a threatened loss to the fund and will facilitate a merger or consolidation of an insured credit union with another insured credit union, or will facilitate the sale of the assets of an open or closed insured credit union to and assumption of its liability by another person, the Board may, upon such terms and conditions as it may determine, make loans secured in whole or in part by assets of an open or closed insured credit union, which loans may be in subordination to the rights of members and creditors of such credit union, or the Board may purchase any of such assets or may guarantee any person against loss by reason of its assuming the liabilities and purchasing the assets of an open or closed insured credit union. For purposes of this paragraph, the term &quot;person&quot; means any credit union, individual, partnership, corporation, trust, estate, cooperative, association, government or governmental subdivision or agency, or other entity.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(3) No agreement which tends to diminish or defeat the right, title, or interest of the Board, in any asset acquired by it under this subsection, either as security for a loan or by purchase, shall be valid against the Board unless such agreement&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(A) shall be in writing;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(B) shall have been executed by the credit union and the person or persons claiming an adverse interest thereunder, including the obligor, contemporaneously with the acquisition of the asset by the credit union;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(C) shall have been approved by the board of directors of the credit union, which approval shall be reflected in the minutes of such board; and</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(D) shall have been continuously, from the time of its execution, an official record of the credit union.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(b) Protection of Fund</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">For the protection of the Fund, the Board, without regard to chapters 1 to 11 of title 40 and division C (except sections 3302, 3307(e), 3501(b), 3509, 3906, 4710, and 4711) of subtitle I of title 41, may&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(1) deal with, complete, reconstruct, rent, renovate, modernize, insure, make contracts for the management of, sell for cash or credit, or lease, in its discretion, any real property acquired or held by it under this section; and</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(2) assign or sell at public or private sale, or otherwise dispose of, any evidence of debt, contract, claim, personal property, or security assigned to or held by it under this section.</p>

<h4 class="paragraph-head">(1) Purpose</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">The purpose of this section is to resolve the problems of insured credit unions at the least possible long-term loss to the Fund.</p>
<h4 class="paragraph-head">(2) Prompt corrective action required</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">The Board shall carry out the purpose of this section by taking prompt corrective action to resolve the problems of insured credit unions.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(b) Regulations required</h4>
<h4 class="paragraph-head">(1) Insured credit unions</h4>
<h4 class="subparagraph-head">(A) In general</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">The Board shall, by regulation, prescribe a system of prompt corrective action for insured credit unions that is&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-3em">(i) consistent with this section; and</p>
<p class="statutory-body-3em">(ii) comparable to section 1831o of this title.</p>
<h4 class="subparagraph-head">(B) Cooperative character of credit unions</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">The Board shall design the system required under subparagraph (A) to take into account that credit unions are not-for-profit cooperatives that&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-3em">(i) do not issue capital stock;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-3em">(ii) must rely on retained earnings to build net worth; and</p>
<p class="statutory-body-3em">(iii) have boards of directors that consist primarily of volunteers.</p>
<h4 class="paragraph-head">(2) New credit unions</h4>
<h4 class="subparagraph-head">(A) In general</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">In addition to regulations under paragraph (1), the Board shall, by regulation, prescribe a system of prompt corrective action that shall apply to new credit unions in lieu of this section and the regulations prescribed under paragraph (1).</p>
<h4 class="subparagraph-head">(B) Criteria for alternative system</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">The Board shall design the system prescribed under subparagraph (A)&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-3em">(i) to carry out the purpose of this section;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-3em">(ii) to recognize that credit unions (as cooperatives that do not issue capital stock) initially have no net worth, and give new credit unions reasonable time to accumulate net worth;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-3em">(iii) to create adequate incentives for new credit unions to become adequately capitalized by the time that they either&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-4em">(I) have been in operation for more than 10 years; or</p>
<p class="statutory-body-4em">(II) have more than $10,000,000 in total assets;</p>
<br class="Q04" />
<p class="statutory-body-3em">(iv) to impose appropriate restrictions and requirements on new credit unions that do not make sufficient progress toward becoming adequately capitalized; and</p>
<p class="statutory-body-3em">(v) to prevent evasion of the purpose of this section.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(c) Net worth categories</h4>
<h4 class="paragraph-head">(1) In general</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">For purposes of this section the following definitions shall apply:</p>
<h4 class="subparagraph-head">(A) Well capitalized</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">An insured credit union is &quot;well capitalized&quot; if&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-3em">(i) it has a net worth ratio of not less than 7 percent; and</p>
<p class="statutory-body-3em">(ii) it meets any applicable risk-based net worth requirement under subsection (d).</p>
<h4 class="subparagraph-head">(B) Adequately capitalized</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">An insured credit union is &quot;adequately capitalized&quot; if&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-3em">(i) it has a net worth ratio of not less than 6 percent; and</p>
<p class="statutory-body-3em">(ii) it meets any applicable risk-based net worth requirement under subsection (d).</p>
<h4 class="subparagraph-head">(C) Undercapitalized</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">An insured credit union is &quot;undercapitalized&quot; if&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-3em">(i) it has a net worth ratio of less than 6 percent; or</p>
<p class="statutory-body-3em">(ii) it fails to meet any applicable risk-based net worth requirement under subsection (d).</p>
<h4 class="subparagraph-head">(D) Significantly undercapitalized</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">An insured credit union is &quot;significantly undercapitalized&quot;&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-3em">(i) if it has a net worth ratio of less than 4 percent; or</p>
<p class="statutory-body-3em">(ii) if&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-4em">(I) it has a net worth ratio of less than 5 percent; and</p>
<p class="statutory-body-4em">(II) it&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-5em">(aa) fails to submit an acceptable net worth restoration plan within the time allowed under subsection (f); or</p>
<p class="statutory-body-5em">(bb) materially fails to implement a net worth restoration plan accepted by the Board.</p>
<h4 class="subparagraph-head">(E) Critically undercapitalized</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">An insured credit union is &quot;critically undercapitalized&quot; if it has a net worth ratio <!-- PDFPage:945 -->of less than 2 percent (or such higher net worth ratio, not to exceed 3 percent, as the Board may specify by regulation).</p>
<h4 class="paragraph-head">(2) Adjusting net worth levels</h4>
<h4 class="subparagraph-head">(A) In general</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">If, for purposes of section 1831o(c) of this title, the Federal banking agencies increase or decrease the required minimum level for the leverage limit (as those terms are used in section 1831o of this title), the Board may, by regulation, and subject to subparagraph (B) of this paragraph, correspondingly increase or decrease 1 or more of the net worth ratios specified in subparagraphs (A) through (D) of paragraph (1) of this subsection in an amount that is equal to not more than the difference between the required minimum level most recently established by the Federal banking agencies and 4 percent of total assets (with respect to institutions regulated by those agencies).</p>
<h4 class="subparagraph-head">(B) Determinations required</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">The Board may increase or decrease net worth ratios under subparagraph (A) only if the Board&mdash;</p>

<h3 class="section-head">&sect;1790e. Temporary Corporate Credit Union Stabilization Fund</h3>
<!-- field-end:head -->
<!-- field-start:statute -->
<h4 class="subsection-head">(a) Establishment of Stabilization Fund</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">There is hereby created in the Treasury of the United States a fund to be known as the &quot;Temporary Corporate Credit Union Stabilization Fund.&quot; The Board will administer the Stabilization Fund as prescribed by section 1789 of this title.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(b) Expenditures from Stabilization Fund</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">Money in the Stabilization Fund shall be available upon requisition by the Board, without fiscal year limitation, for making payments for the purposes described in section 1783(a) of this title, subject to the following additional limitations:</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(1) All payments other than administrative payments shall be connected to the conservatorship, liquidation, or threatened conservatorship or liquidation, of a corporate credit union.</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(2) Prior to authorizing each payment the Board shall&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(A) certify that, absent the existence of the Stabilization Fund, the Board would have made the identical payment out of the National Credit Union Share Insurance Fund (Insurance Fund); and</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(B) report each such certification to the Committee on Banking, Housing, and Urban Affairs of the Senate and the Committee on Financial Services of the House of Representatives.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(c) Authority to borrow</h4>
<h4 class="paragraph-head">(1) In general</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">The Stabilization Fund is authorized to borrow from the Secretary of the Treasury from time-to-time as deemed necessary by the Board. The maximum outstanding amount of all borrowings from the Treasury by the Stabilization Fund and the National Credit Union Share Insurance Fund, combined, is limited to the amount provided for in section 1783(d)(1) of this title, including any authorized increases in that amount.</p>
<h4 class="paragraph-head">(2) Repayment of advances</h4>
<h4 class="subparagraph-head">(A) In general</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">The advances made under this section shall be repaid by the Stabilization Fund, and interest on such advance shall be paid, to the General fund of the Treasury.</p>
<h4 class="subparagraph-head">(B) Variable rate of interest</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">The Secretary of the Treasury shall make the first rate determination at the time of the first advance under this section and shall reset the rate again for all advances on each anniversary of the first advance. The interest rate shall be equal to the average market yield on outstanding marketable obligations of the United States with remaining periods to maturity equal to 12 months.</p>
<h4 class="paragraph-head">(3) Repayment schedule</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">The Stabilization Fund shall repay the advances on a first-in, first-out basis, with interest on the amount repaid, at times and dates determined by the Board at its discretion. All advances shall be repaid not later than the date of the seventh anniversary of the first advance to the Stabilization Fund, unless the Board extends this final repayment date. The Board shall obtain the concurrence of the Secretary of the Treasury on any proposed extension, including the terms and conditions of the extended repayment and any additional advances.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(d) Assessment authority</h4>
<h4 class="paragraph-head">(1) Assessments relating to expenditures under subsection (b)</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">In order to make expenditures, as described in subsection (b), the Board may assess a special premium with respect to each insured credit union in an aggregate amount that is reasonably calculated to make any pending or <!-- PDFPage:950 -->future expenditure described in subsection (b), which premium shall be due and payable not later than 60 days after the date of the assessment. In setting the amount of any assessment under this subsection, the Board shall take into consideration any potential impact on credit union earnings that such an assessment may have.</p>
<h4 class="paragraph-head">(2) Special premiums relating to repayments under subsection (c)(3)</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">Not later than 90 days before the scheduled date of each repayment described in subsection (c)(3), the Board shall set the amount of the upcoming repayment and shall determine whether the Stabilization Fund will have sufficient funds to make the repayment. If the Stabilization Fund is not likely to have sufficient funds to make the repayment, the Board shall assess with respect to each insured credit union a special premium, which shall be due and payable not later than 60 days after the date of the assessment, in an aggregate amount calculated to ensure that the Stabilization Fund is able to make the required repayment.</p>
<h4 class="paragraph-head">(3) Computation</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">Any assessment or premium charge for an insured credit union under this subsection shall be stated as a percentage of its insured shares, as represented on the previous call report of that insured credit union. The percentage shall be identical for each insured credit union. Any insured credit union that fails to make timely payment of the assessment or special premium is subject to the procedures and penalties described under subsections (d), (e), and (f) of section 1782 of this title.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(e) Distributions from Insurance Fund</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">At the end of any calendar year in which the Stabilization Fund has an outstanding advance from the Treasury, the Insurance Fund is prohibited from making the distribution to insured credit unions described in section 1782(c)(3) of this title. In lieu of the distribution described in that section, the Insurance Fund shall make a distribution to the Stabilization Fund of the maximum amount possible that does not reduce the Insurance Fund's equity ratio below the normal operating level and does not reduce the Insurance Fund's available assets ratio below 1.0 percent.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(f) Investment of Stabilization Fund assets</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">The Board may request the Secretary of the Treasury to invest such portion of the Stabilization Fund as is not, in the Board's judgment, required to meet the current needs of the Stabilization Fund. Such investments shall be made by the Secretary of the Treasury in public debt securities, with maturities suitable to the needs of the Stabilization Fund, as determined by the Board, and bearing interest at a rate determined by the Secretary of the Treasury, taking into consideration current market yields on outstanding marketable obligations of the United States of comparable maturity.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(g) Reports</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">The Board shall submit an annual report to Congress on the financial condition and the results of the operation of the Stabilization Fund. The report is due to Congress within 30 days after each anniversary of the first advance made under subsection (c)(1). Because the Fund will use advances from the Treasury to meet corporate stabilization costs with full repayment of borrowings to Treasury at the Board's discretion not due until 7 years from the initial advance, to the extent operating expenses of the Fund exceed income, the financial condition of the Fund may reflect a deficit. With planned and required future repayments, the Board shall resolve all deficits prior to termination of the Fund.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(h) Closing of Stabilization Fund</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">Within 90 days following the seventh anniversary of the initial Stabilization Fund advance, or earlier at the Board's discretion, the Board shall distribute any funds, property, or other assets remaining in the Stabilization Fund to the Insurance Fund and shall close the Stabilization Fund. If the Board extends the final repayment date as permitted under subsection (c)(3), the mandatory date for closing the Stabilization Fund shall be extended by the same number of days.</p>
