<!-- field-start:statute -->
<h4 class="subsection-head">(a) Findings</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">The Congress finds as follows:</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(1) In the Expedited Funds Availability Act [12 U.S.C. 4001 et seq.], enacted on August 10, 1987, the Congress directed the Board of Governors of the Federal Reserve System to consider establishing regulations requiring Federal reserve banks and depository institutions to provide for check truncation, in order to improve the check processing system.</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(2) In that same Act, the Congress&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(A) provided the Board of Governors of the Federal Reserve System with full authority to regulate all aspects of the payment system, including the receipt, payment, collection, and clearing of checks, and related functions of the payment system pertaining to checks; and</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(B) directed that the exercise of such authority by the Board superseded any State law, including the Uniform Commercial Code, as in effect in any State.</p>
<br class="Q04" />
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(3) Check truncation is no less desirable in 2003 for both financial service customers and the financial services industry, to reduce costs, improve efficiency in check collections, and expedite funds availability for customers than it was over 15 years ago when Congress first directed the Board to consider establishing such a process.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(b) Purposes</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">The purposes of this chapter are as follows:</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(1) To facilitate check truncation by authorizing substitute checks.</p>
<!-- PDFPage:1776 --><p class="statutory-body-1em">(2) To foster innovation in the check collection system without mandating receipt of checks in electronic form.</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(3) To improve the overall efficiency of the Nation's payments system.</p>

<p class="statutory-body-3em">(ii) the consumer has a warranty claim with respect to such substitute check;</p>
<br class="Q04" />
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(C) the consumer suffered a resulting loss; and</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(D) the production of the original check or a better copy of the original check is necessary to determine the validity of any claim described in subparagraph (B).</p>

<h4 class="paragraph-head">(2) Claim in writing</h4>

<p class="statutory-body-4em">(I) the original check; or</p>

<br class="Q04" />
<p class="statutory-body-3em">(ii) demonstrated to the consumer that the substitute check was properly charged to the consumer account.</p>
<h4 class="paragraph-head">(2) Timing of recredit</h4>
<h4 class="subparagraph-head">(A) In general</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">The bank shall recredit the consumer's account for the amount described in paragraph (1) no later than the end of the business day following the business day on which the bank determines the consumer's claim is valid.</p>
<h4 class="subparagraph-head">(B) Recredit pending investigation</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">If the bank has not yet determined that the consumer's claim is valid before the end of the 10th business day after the business <!-- PDFPage:1780 -->day on which the consumer submitted the claim, the bank shall recredit the consumer's account for&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-3em">(i) the lesser of the amount of the substitute check that was charged against the consumer account, or $2,500, together with interest if the account is an interest-bearing account, no later than the end of such 10th business day; and</p>
<p class="statutory-body-3em">(ii) the remaining amount of the substitute check that was charged against the consumer account, if any, together with interest if the account is an interest-bearing account, not later than the 45th calendar day following the business day on which the consumer submits the claim.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(d) Availability of recredit</h4>
<h4 class="paragraph-head">(1) Next business day availability</h4>

<h4 class="paragraph-head">(2) Safeguard exceptions</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">A bank may delay availability to a consumer of a recredit provided under subsection (c)(2)(B)(i) until the start of either the business day following the business day on which the bank determines that the consumer's claim is valid or the 45th calendar day following the business day on which the consumer submits a claim for such recredit in accordance with subsection (b), whichever is earlier, in any of the following circumstances:</p>
<h4 class="subparagraph-head">(A) New accounts</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">The claim is made during the 30-day period beginning on the business day the consumer account was established.</p>
<h4 class="subparagraph-head">(B) Repeated overdrafts</h4>

<p class="statutory-body-3em">(i) on 6 or more business days during the 6-month period ending on the date on which the consumer submits the claim, the balance in the consumer account was negative or would have become negative if checks or other charges to the account had been paid; or</p>
<p class="statutory-body-3em">(ii) on 2 or more business days during such 6-month period, the balance in the consumer account was negative or would have become negative in the amount of $5,000 or more if checks or other charges to the account had been paid.</p>
<h4 class="subparagraph-head">(C) Prevention of fraud losses</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">The bank has reasonable cause to believe that the claim is fraudulent, based on facts (other than the fact that the check in question or the consumer is of a particular class) that would cause a well-grounded belief in the mind of a reasonable person that the claim is fraudulent.</p>
<h4 class="paragraph-head">(3) Overdraft fees</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">No bank that, in accordance with paragraph (2), delays the availability of a recredit under subsection (c) to any consumer account may impose any overdraft fees with respect to drafts drawn by the consumer on such recredited amount before the end of the 5-day period beginning on the date notice of the delay in the availability of such amount is sent by the bank to the consumer.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(e) Reversal of recredit</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">A bank may reverse a recredit to a consumer account if the bank&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(1) determines that a substitute check for which the bank recredited a consumer account under subsection (c) was in fact properly charged to the consumer account; and</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(2) notifies the consumer in accordance with subsection (f)(3).</p>

<p class="statutory-body-3em">(i) accurately represents all of the information on the front and back of the original check (as of the time the original check was truncated); or</p>
<p class="statutory-body-3em">(ii) is otherwise sufficient to determine whether or not the consumer's claim is valid; and</p>
<br class="Q04" />
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(B) an explanation of the basis for the determination by the bank that the substitute check was properly charged, including a statement that the consumer may request copies of any information or documents on which the bank relied in making the determination.</p>

<h4 class="subsection-head">(h) Clarification concerning consumer possession</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">A consumer who was provided a substitute check may make a claim for an expedited recredit under this section with regard to a transaction involving the substitute check whether or not the consumer is in possession of the substitute check.</p>

<h3 class="section-head">&sect;5018. Depositary services efficiency and cost reduction</h3>
<!-- field-end:head -->
<!-- field-start:statute -->
<h4 class="subsection-head">(a) Findings</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">The Congress finds as follows:</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(1) The Secretary of the Treasury has long compensated financial institutions for various critical depositary and financial agency services provided for or on behalf of the United States by&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(A) placing large balances, commonly referred to as &quot;compensating balances&quot;, on deposit at such institutions; and</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(B) using imputed interest on such funds to offset charges for the various depositary and financial agency services provided to or on behalf of the Government.</p>
<br class="Q04" />
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(2) As a result of sharp declines in interest rates over the last few years to record low levels, or the public debt outstanding reaching the statutory debt limit, the Department of the Treasury often has had to dramatically increase or decrease the size of the compensating balances on deposit at these financial institutions.</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(3) The fluctuation of the compensating balances, and the necessary pledging of collateral by financial institutions to secure the value of compensating balances placed with those institutions, have created unintended financial uncertainty for the Secretary of the Treasury and for the management by financial institutions of their cash and securities.</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(4) It is imperative that the process for providing financial services to the Government be transparent, and provide the information necessary for the Congress to effectively exercise its appropriation and oversight responsibilities.</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(5) The use of direct payment for services rendered would strengthen cash and debt management responsibilities of the Secretary of the Treasury because the Secretary would no longer need to dramatically increase or decrease the level of such balances when interest rates fluctuate sharply or when the public debt outstanding reaches the statutory debt limit.</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(6) An alternative to the use of compensating balances, such as direct payments to financial institutions, would ensure that payments to financial institutions for the services they provide would be made in a more predictable manner and could result in cost savings.</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(7) Limiting the use of compensating balances could result in a more direct and cost-efficient method of obtaining those services currently provided under compensating balance arrangements.</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(8) A transition from the use of compensating balances to another compensation method must be carefully managed to prevent higher-than-necessary transitional costs and enable participating financial institutions to modify their planned investment of cash and securities.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(b) Authorization of appropriations for services rendered by depositaries and financial agencies of the United States</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">There are authorized to be appropriated for fiscal years beginning after fiscal year 2003 to the Secretary of the Treasury such sums as may be necessary for reimbursing financial institutions in their capacity as depositaries and financial agents of the United States for all services <!-- PDFPage:1786 -->required or directed by the Secretary of the Treasury, or a designee of the Secretary, to be performed by such financial institutions on behalf of the Secretary of the Treasury or another Federal agency, including services rendered before fiscal year 2004.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(c) Orderly transition</h4>
<h4 class="paragraph-head">(1) In general</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">As appropriations authorized in subsection (b) become available, the Secretary of the Treasury shall promptly begin the process of phasing in the use of the appropriations to pay financial institutions serving as depositaries and financial agents of the United States, and transitioning from the use of compensating balances to fund these services.</p>
<h4 class="paragraph-head">(2) Post-transition use limited to extraordinary circumstances</h4>
<h4 class="subparagraph-head">(A) In general</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">Following the transition to the use of the appropriations authorized in subsection (b), the Secretary of the Treasury may use the compensating balances to pay financial institutions serving as depositaries and financial agents of the United States only in extraordinary situations where the Secretary determines that they are needed to ensure the fiscal operations of the Government continue to function in an efficient and effective manner.</p>
<h4 class="subparagraph-head">(B) Report</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">Any use of compensating balances pursuant to subparagraph (A) shall promptly be reported by the Secretary of the Treasury to the Committee on Financial Services of the House of Representatives and the Committee on Banking, Housing, and Urban Affairs of the Senate.</p>
<h4 class="paragraph-head">(3) Requirements for orderly transition</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">In transitioning to the use of the appropriations authorized in subsection (b), the Secretary of the Treasury shall take such steps as may be appropriate to&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(A) prevent abrupt financial disruption to the functions of the Department of the Treasury or to the participating financial institutions; and</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(B) maintain adequate accounting and management controls to ensure that payments to financial institutions for their banking services provided to the Government as depositaries and financial agents are accurate and that the arrangements last no longer than is necessary.</p>
<h4 class="paragraph-head">(4) Reports required</h4>
<h4 class="subparagraph-head">(A) Annual report</h4>
<h4 class="clause-head">(i) In general</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-3em">For each fiscal year, the Secretary of the Treasury shall submit a report to the Congress on the use of compensating balances and on the use of appropriations authorized in subsection (b) during that fiscal year.</p>
<h4 class="clause-head">(ii) Inclusion in budget</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-3em">The report required under clause (i) may be submitted as part of the budget submitted by the President under section 1105 of title 31 for the following fiscal year and if so, the report shall be submitted concurrently to the Committee on Financial Services of the House of Representatives and the Committee on Banking, Housing, and Urban Affairs of the Senate.</p>
<h4 class="subparagraph-head">(B) Final report following transition</h4>
<h4 class="clause-head">(i) In general</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-3em">Following completion of the transition from the use of compensating balances to the use of the appropriations authorized in subsection (b) to pay financial institutions for their services as depositaries and financial agents of the United States, the Secretary of the Treasury shall submit a report on the transition to the Committee on Financial Services of the House of Representatives and the Committee on Banking, Housing, and Urban Affairs of the Senate.</p>
<h4 class="clause-head">(ii) Contents of report</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-3em">The report submitted under clause (i) shall include a detailed analysis of&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-4em">(I) the cost of transition;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-4em">(II) the direct costs of the services being paid from the appropriations authorized in subsection (b); and</p>
<p class="statutory-body-4em">(III) the benefits realized from the use of direct payment for such services, rather than the use of compensating balance arrangements.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(d) Omitted</h4>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(e) Effective date</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">Notwithstanding section 20,<sup><a href="#5018_1_target" name="5018_1">1</a></sup> this section shall take effect on October 28, 2003.</p>
