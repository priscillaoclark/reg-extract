<h4 class="subsection-head">(c) State coordination</h4>
<h4 class="paragraph-head">(1) Consultation and coordination</h4>

<p class="statutory-body-2em">(A) avoids duplication;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(B) shares information relevant to the supervision of the depository institution holding company;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(C) achieves the objectives of subsection (b); and</p>

<h4 class="paragraph-head">(4) Fee permitted for examination costs</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">An appropriate Federal banking agency that conducts an examination or enforcement action pursuant to this section may collect an assessment, fee, or such other charge from the subsidiary as the appropriate Federal banking agency determines necessary or appropriate to carry out the responsibilities of the appropriate Federal banking agency in connection with such examination.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(e) Referrals for enforcement by appropriate Federal banking agency</h4>
<h4 class="paragraph-head">(1) Recommendation of enforcement action</h4>

<!-- PDFPage:1144 --><h4 class="paragraph-head">(2) Back-up authority of the appropriate Federal banking agency</h4>

<h4 class="subsection-head">(f) Coordination among appropriate Federal banking agencies</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">Each Federal banking agency, prior to or when exercising authority under subsection (d) or (e) shall&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(1) provide reasonable notice to, and consult with, the appropriate Federal banking agency or State bank supervisor (or other State regulatory agency) of the nondepository institution subsidiary of a depository institution holding company that is described in subsection (d) before commencing any examination of the subsidiary;</p>
