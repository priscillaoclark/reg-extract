<!-- field-end:head -->
<!-- field-start:statute -->
<h4 class="subsection-head">(a) Findings</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">The Congress finds that&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(1) the disparate State laws under which mortgages are foreclosed on behalf of the Secretary covering 1- to 4-family residential properties&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(A) burden certain programs administered by the Secretary;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(B) increase the costs of collecting obligations; and</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(C) generally are a detriment to the community in which the properties are located;</p>
<br class="Q04" />
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(2) the long periods required to complete the foreclosure of such mortgages under certain State laws&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(A) lead to deterioration in the condition of the properties involved;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(B) necessitate substantial Federal holding expenditures;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(C) increase the risk of vandalism, fire loss, depreciation, damage, and waste with respect to the properties; and</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(D) adversely affect the neighborhoods in which the properties are located;</p>
<br class="Q04" />
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(3) these conditions seriously impair the ability of the Secretary to protect the Federal financial interest in the affected properties and frustrate attainment of the objectives of the underlying Federal program authority;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(4) the availability of uniform and more expeditious procedures, with no right of redemption in the mortgagor or others, for the foreclosure of these mortgages by the Secretary will tend to ameliorate these conditions; and</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(5) providing the Secretary with a nonjudicial foreclosure procedure will reduce unnecessary litigation by removing many foreclosures from the courts if they contribute to overcrowded calendars.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(b) Purpose</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">The purpose of this chapter is to create a uniform Federal foreclosure remedy for single family mortgages that&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(1) are held by the Secretary pursuant to title I or title II of the National Housing Act [12 U.S.C. 1702 et seq., 1707 et seq.]; or</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(2) secure loans obligated by the Secretary under section 1452b&#160;<sup><a href="#3751_1_target" name="3751_1">1</a></sup> of title 42.</p>

<!-- field-end:head -->
<!-- field-start:statute -->
<h4 class="subsection-head">(a) Delivery of deeds</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">The foreclosure commissioner shall, upon delivery of a deed or deeds to the purchaser or purchasers (which shall be without warranty or covenants to the purchaser or purchasers) obtain the balance of the purchase price in accordance with the terms of sale provided in the notice of default and foreclosure sale. Notwithstanding any State law to the contrary, delivery of a deed by the foreclosure commissioner shall be a conveyance of the property, and constitute passage of title to the mortgaged property, and no judicial proceedings shall be required ancillary or supplementary to the procedures provided in this chapter to assure the validity of the conveyance or confirmation of such conveyance.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(b) Right of possession</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">A purchaser at a foreclosure sale held pursuant to this chapter shall be entitled to possession upon passage of title under subsection (a) to the mortgaged property, subject to any interest or interests not barred under section 3765 of this title. Any person remaining in possession of the mortgaged property after the passage of title shall be deemed a tenant at sufferance subject to eviction under local law.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(c) Death of purchaser</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">If a purchaser dies before execution and delivery of the deed conveying the property to the purchaser, the foreclosure commissioner shall execute and deliver the deed to a representative of the decedent purchaser's estate upon payment of the purchase price in accordance with the terms of sale. Such delivery to the representative of the purchaser's estate shall have the same effect as if accomplished during the lifetime of the purchaser.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(d) Bona fide purchaser</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">The purchaser of property under this chapter shall be presumed to be a bona fide purchaser.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(e) No right of redemption</h4>
<h4 class="paragraph-head">(1) In general</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">There shall be no right of redemption, or right of possession based upon a right of redemption, in the mortgagor or others subsequent to a foreclosure completed pursuant to this chapter.</p>
<h4 class="paragraph-head">(2) Certain provisions</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">Section 1710(l) of this title and section 1452c of title 42 shall not apply to mortgages foreclosed under this chapter.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(f) Taxes</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">When a mortgage foreclosed pursuant to this chapter is conveyed to the Secretary, no tax shall be imposed or collected with respect to the foreclosure commissioner's deed (including any tax customarily imposed upon the deed instrument or upon the conveyance or transfer of title to the property). Failure to collect or pay a tax of the type and under the circumstances stated in the preceding sentence shall not be grounds for refusing to record such a deed, for failing to recognize such recordation as imparting notice, or for denying the enforcement of such a deed and its provisions in any State or Federal court.</p>
