<p class="statutory-body-1em">Within 30 days of receipt of an expression of interest by a priority purchaser, the Secretary shall provide such purchaser with information on the assistance available from the Federal Government to facilitate a transfer and the owner shall provide appropriate information on the housing, as determined by the Secretary.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(c) Right of refusal for other qualified purchasers</h4>

The negotiated sale price may not exceed the preservation value of the housing determined under section 4103(b)(2) of this title.
