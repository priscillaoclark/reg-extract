<p class="statutory-body-2em">The cost of any examination under subparagraph (A) shall be assessed against and collected from the foreign bank or the foreign company that controls the foreign bank, as the case may be, only to the same extent that fees are collected by the Board for examination of any State member bank.</p>

<h4 class="paragraph-head">(1) Prior approval required</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">No foreign bank may establish a branch or an agency, or acquire ownership or control of a commercial lending company, without the prior approval of the Board.</p>
<h4 class="paragraph-head">(2) Required standards for approval</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">Except as provided in paragraph (6), the Board may not approve an application under paragraph (1) unless it determines that&mdash;</p>

<p class="statutory-body-2em">(B) the foreign bank has furnished to the Board the information it needs to adequately assess the application.</p>
<h4 class="paragraph-head">(3) Standards for approval</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">In acting on any application under paragraph (1), the Board may take into account&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(A) whether the appropriate authorities in the home country of the foreign bank have consented to the proposed establishment of a branch, agency or commercial lending company in the United States by the foreign bank;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(B) the financial and managerial resources of the foreign bank, including the bank's experience and capacity to engage in international banking;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(C) whether the foreign bank has provided the Board with adequate assurances that the bank will make available to the Board such information on the operations or activities of the foreign bank and any affiliate of the bank that the Board deems necessary to determine and enforce compliance with this chapter, the Bank Holding Company Act of 1956 [12 U.S.C. 1841 et seq.], and other applicable Federal law;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(D) whether the foreign bank and the United States affiliates of the bank are in compliance with applicable United States law; and</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(E) for a foreign bank that presents a risk to the stability of United States financial system, whether the home country of the foreign bank has adopted, or is making demonstrable progress toward adopting, an appropriate system of financial regulation for the financial system of such home country to mitigate such risk.</p>
<h4 class="paragraph-head">(4) Factor</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">In acting on an application under paragraph (1), the Board shall not make the size of the foreign bank the sole determinant factor, and may take into account the needs of the community as well as the length of operation of the foreign bank and its relative size in its home country. Nothing in this paragraph shall affect the ability of the Board to order a State branch, agency, or commercial lending company subsidiary to terminate its activities in the United States pursuant to any standard set forth in this chapter.</p>
<h4 class="paragraph-head">(5) Establishment of conditions</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">The Board may impose such conditions on its approval under this subsection as it deems necessary.</p>
<h4 class="paragraph-head">(6) Exception</h4>
<h4 class="subparagraph-head">(A) In general</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">If the Board is unable to find, under paragraph (2), that a foreign bank is subject to comprehensive supervision or regulation on a consolidated basis by the appropriate authorities in its home country, the Board may nevertheless approve an application by such foreign bank under paragraph (1) if&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-3em">(i) the appropriate authorities in the home country of the foreign bank are actively working to establish arrangements for the consolidated supervision of such bank; and</p>
<p class="statutory-body-3em">(ii) all other factors are consistent with approval.</p>
<h4 class="subparagraph-head">(B) Other considerations</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">In deciding whether to use its discretion under subparagraph (A), the Board shall also consider whether the foreign bank has adopted and implements procedures to combat money laundering. The Board may also <!-- PDFPage:1502 -->take into account whether the home country of the foreign bank is developing a legal regime to address money laundering or is participating in multilateral efforts to combat money laundering.</p>
<h4 class="subparagraph-head">(C) Additional conditions</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">In approving an application under this paragraph, the Board, after requesting and taking into consideration the views of the appropriate State bank supervisor or the Comptroller of the Currency, as the case may be, may impose such conditions or restrictions relating to the activities or business operations of the proposed branch, agency, or commercial lending company subsidiary, including restrictions on sources of funding, as are considered appropriate. The Board shall coordinate with the appropriate State bank supervisor or the Comptroller of the Currency, as appropriate, in the implementation of such conditions or restrictions.</p>
<h4 class="subparagraph-head">(D) Modification of conditions</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">Any condition or restriction imposed by the Board in connection with the approval of an application under authority of this paragraph may be modified or withdrawn.</p>

<h4 class="subparagraph-head">(B) Failure to submit information</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">The Board may deny any application if it does not receive information requested from the applicant foreign bank or appropriate authorities in the home country of the foreign bank in sufficient time to permit the Board to evaluate such information adequately within the time periods for final action set forth in subparagraph (A).</p>
<h4 class="subparagraph-head">(C) Waiver</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">A foreign bank may waive the applicability of this paragraph with respect to any application under paragraph (1).</p>

<p class="statutory-body-1em">The Board, after notice and opportunity for hearing and notice to any appropriate State bank supervisor, may order a foreign bank that operates a State branch or agency or commercial lending company subsidiary in the United States to terminate the activities of such branch, agency, or subsidiary if the Board finds that&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(A)(i) the foreign bank is not subject to comprehensive supervision or regulation on a consolidated basis by the appropriate authorities in its home country; and</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(ii) the appropriate authorities in the home country of the foreign bank are not making demonstrable progress in establishing arrangements for the comprehensive supervision or regulation of such foreign bank on a consolidated basis;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(B)(i) there is reasonable cause to believe that such foreign bank, or any affiliate of such foreign bank, has committed a violation of law or engaged in an unsafe or unsound banking practice in the United States; and</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(ii) as a result of such violation or practice, the continued operation of the foreign bank's branch, agency or commercial lending company subsidiary in the United States would not be consistent with the public interest or with the purposes of this chapter, the Bank Holding Company Act of 1956 [12 U.S.C. 1841 et seq.], or the Federal Deposit Insurance Act [12 U.S.C. 1811 et seq.]; or</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(C) for a foreign bank that presents a risk to the stability of the United States financial system, the home country of the foreign bank has not adopted, or made demonstrable progress toward adopting, an appropriate system of financial regulation to mitigate such risk.</p>
<br class="Q04" />
<p class="statutory-body-block-1em">However, in making findings under this paragraph, the Board shall not make size the sole determinant factor, and may take into account the needs of the community as well as the length of operation of the foreign bank and its relative size in its home country. Nothing in this paragraph shall affect the ability of the Board to order a State branch, agency, or commercial lending company subsidiary to terminate its activities in the United States pursuant to any standard set forth in this chapter.</p>
<h4 class="paragraph-head">(2) Discretion to deny hearing</h4>
