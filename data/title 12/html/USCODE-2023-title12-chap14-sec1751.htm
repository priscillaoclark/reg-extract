<p class="note-body-1em">&quot;(1) The American credit union movement began as a cooperative effort to serve the productive and provident credit needs of individuals of modest means.</p>
<p class="note-body-1em">&quot;(2) Credit unions continue to fulfill this public purpose, and current members and membership groups should not face divestiture from the financial services institution of their choice as a result of recent court action.</p>
<p class="note-body-1em">&quot;(3) To promote thrift and credit extension, a meaningful affinity and bond among members, manifested by a commonality of routine interaction, shared and related work experiences, interests, or activities, or the maintenance of an otherwise well-understood sense of cohesion or identity is essential to the fulfillment of the public mission of credit unions.</p>
<p class="note-body-1em">&quot;(4) Credit unions, unlike many other participants in the financial services market, are exempt from Federal and most State taxes because they are member-owned, democratically operated, not-for-profit organizations generally managed by volunteer boards of directors and because they have the specified mission of meeting the credit and savings needs of consumers, especially persons of modest means.</p>
<p class="note-body-1em">&quot;(5) Improved credit union safety and soundness provisions will enhance the public benefit that citizens receive from these cooperative financial services institutions.&quot;</p>
