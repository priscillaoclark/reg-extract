<p class="statutory-body-2em">The Council, acting through the Office of Financial Research, may require the submission of periodic and other reports from any nonbank financial company or bank holding company for the purpose of assessing the extent to which a financial activity or financial market in which the nonbank financial company or bank holding company participates, or the nonbank financial company or bank holding company itself, poses a threat to the financial stability of the United States.</p>
<h4 class="subparagraph-head">(B) Mitigation of report burden</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">Before requiring the submission of reports from any nonbank financial company or bank holding company that is regulated by a member agency or any primary financial regulatory agency, the Council, acting through the Office of Financial Research, shall coordinate with such agencies and shall, whenever possible, rely on information available from the Office of Financial Research or such agencies.</p>
<h4 class="subparagraph-head">(C) Mitigation in case of foreign financial companies</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">Before requiring the submission of reports from a company that is a foreign nonbank financial company or foreign-based bank holding company, the Council shall, acting through the Office of Financial Research, to the extent appropriate, consult with the appropriate foreign regulator of such company and, whenever possible, rely on information already being collected by such foreign regulator, with English translation.</p>
<h4 class="paragraph-head">(4) Back-up examination by the Board of Governors</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">If the Council is unable to determine whether the financial activities of a U.S. nonbank financial company pose a threat to the financial stability of the United States, based on information or reports obtained under paragraphs (1) and (3), discussions with management, and publicly available information, the Council may request the Board of Governors, and the Board of Governors is authorized, to conduct an examination of the U.S. nonbank financial company for the sole purpose of determining whether the nonbank financial company should be supervised by the Board of Governors for purposes of this subchapter.</p>
<h4 class="paragraph-head">(5) Confidentiality</h4>
<h4 class="subparagraph-head">(A) In general</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">The Council, the Office of Financial Research, and the other member agencies shall maintain the confidentiality of any data, information, and reports submitted under this subchapter.</p>
<h4 class="subparagraph-head">(B) Retention of privilege</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">The submission of any nonpublicly available data or information under this subsection and part B shall not constitute a waiver of, or otherwise affect, any privilege arising under Federal or State law (including the rules of any Federal or State court) to which the data or information is otherwise subject.</p>
<h4 class="subparagraph-head">(C) Freedom of Information Act</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">Section 552 of title 5, including the exceptions thereunder, shall apply to any data or information submitted under this subsection and part B.</p>

<h4 class="subsection-head">(a) U.S. nonbank financial companies supervised by the Board of Governors</h4>
<h4 class="paragraph-head">(1) Determination</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">The Council, on a nondelegable basis and by a vote of not fewer than 2/3 of the voting members then serving, including an affirmative vote by the Chairperson, may determine that a U.S. nonbank financial company shall be supervised by the Board of Governors and shall be subject to prudential standards, in accordance with this subchapter, if the Council determines that material financial distress at the U.S. nonbank financial company, or the nature, scope, size, scale, concentration, interconnectedness, or mix of the activities of the U.S. nonbank financial company, could pose a threat to the financial stability of the United States.</p>
<h4 class="paragraph-head">(2) Considerations</h4>

<h4 class="paragraph-head">(1) Determinations</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">In order to avoid evasion of this subchapter, the Council, on its own initiative or at the request of the Board of Governors, may determine, on a nondelegable basis and by a vote of not fewer than 2/3 of the voting members then serving, including an affirmative vote by the Chairperson, that&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(A) material financial distress related to, or the nature, scope, size, scale, concentration, interconnectedness, or mix of, the financial activities conducted directly or indirectly by a company incorporated or organized under the laws of the United States or any State or the financial activities in the United States of a company incorporated or organized in a country other than the United States would pose a threat to the financial stability of the United States, based on consideration of the factors in subsection (a)(2) or (b)(2), as applicable;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(B) the company is organized or operates in such a manner as to evade the application of this subchapter; and</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(C) such financial activities of the company shall be supervised by the Board of Governors and subject to prudential standards in accordance with this subchapter, consistent with paragraph (3).</p>
<h4 class="paragraph-head">(2) Report</h4>

<h4 class="subparagraph-head">(A) Establishment of an intermediate holding company</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">Upon a determination under paragraph (1), the company that is the subject of the determination may establish an intermediate holding company in which the financial activities of such company and its subsidiaries shall be conducted (other than the activities described in section 5367(b)(2) of this title) in compliance with any regulations or guidance provided by the Board of Governors. Such intermediate holding company shall be subject to the supervision of the Board of Governors and to prudential standards under this subchapter as if the intermediate holding com<!-- PDFPage:1841 -->pany were a nonbank financial company supervised by the Board of Governors.</p>
<h4 class="subparagraph-head">(B) Action of the Board of Governors</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">To facilitate the supervision of the financial activities subject to the determination in paragraph (1), the Board of Governors may require a company to establish an intermediate holding company, as provided for in section 5367 of this title, which would be subject to the supervision of the Board of Governors and to prudential standards under this subchapter, as if the intermediate holding company were a nonbank financial company supervised by the Board of Governors.</p>
<h4 class="paragraph-head">(4) Notice and opportunity for hearing and final determination; judicial review</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">Subsections (d) through (h) shall apply to determinations made by the Council pursuant to paragraph (1) in the same manner as such subsections apply to nonbank financial companies.</p>
<h4 class="paragraph-head">(5) Covered financial activities</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">For purposes of this subsection, the term &quot;financial activities&quot;&mdash;</p>

<h4 class="paragraph-head">(6) Only financial activities subject to prudential supervision</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">Nonfinancial activities of the company shall not be subject to supervision by the Board of Governors and prudential standards of the Board. For purposes of this Act, the financial activities that are the subject of the determination in paragraph (1) shall be subject to the same requirements as a nonbank financial company supervised by the Board of Governors. Nothing in this paragraph shall prohibit or limit the authority of the Board of Governors to apply prudential standards under this subchapter to the financial activities that are subject to the determination in paragraph (1).</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(d) Reevaluation and rescission</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">The Council shall&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(1) not less frequently than annually, reevaluate each determination made under subsections (a) and (b) with respect to such nonbank financial company supervised by the Board of Governors; and</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(2) rescind any such determination, if the Council, by a vote of not fewer than 2/3 of the voting members then serving, including an affirmative vote by the Chairperson, determines that the nonbank financial company no longer meets the standards under subsection (a) or (b), as applicable.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(e) Notice and opportunity for hearing and final determination</h4>
<h4 class="paragraph-head">(1) In general</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">The Council shall provide to a nonbank financial company written notice of a proposed determination of the Council, including an explanation of the basis of the proposed determination of the Council, that a nonbank financial company shall be supervised by the Board of Governors and shall be subject to prudential standards in accordance with this subchapter.</p>
<h4 class="paragraph-head">(2) Hearing</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">Not later than 30 days after the date of receipt of any notice of a proposed determination under paragraph (1), the nonbank financial company may request, in writing, an opportunity for a written or oral hearing before the Council to contest the proposed determination. Upon receipt of a timely request, the Council shall fix a time (not later than 30 days after the date of receipt of the request) and place at which such company may appear, personally or through counsel, to submit written materials (or, at the sole discretion of the Council, oral testimony and oral argument).</p>
<h4 class="paragraph-head">(3) Final determination</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">Not later than 60 days after the date of a hearing under paragraph (2), the Council shall notify the nonbank financial company of the final determination of the Council, which shall contain a statement of the basis for the decision of the Council.</p>
<h4 class="paragraph-head">(4) No hearing requested</h4>

<h4 class="paragraph-head">(2) Notice</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">The Council shall provide notice of a waiver or modification under this subsection to the nonbank financial company concerned as soon as practicable, but not later than 24 hours after the waiver or modification is granted.</p>
<h4 class="paragraph-head">(3) International coordination</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">In making a determination under paragraph (1), the Council shall consult with the appropriate home country supervisor, if any, of the foreign nonbank financial company that is being considered for such a determination.</p>

<p class="statutory-body-1em">The Council shall allow a nonbank financial company to request, in writing, an opportunity for a written or oral hearing before the Council to contest a waiver or modification <!-- PDFPage:1842 -->under this subsection, not later than 10 days after the date of receipt of notice of the waiver or modification by the company. Upon receipt of a timely request, the Council shall fix a time (not later than 15 days after the date of receipt of the request) and place at which the nonbank financial company may appear, personally or through counsel, to submit written materials (or, at the sole discretion of the Council, oral testimony and oral argument).</p>

Review of such an action shall be limited to whether the final determination made under this section was arbitrary and capricious.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(i) International coordination</h4>

<h3 class="section-head">&sect;5325. Enhanced supervision and prudential standards for nonbank financial companies supervised by the Board of Governors and certain bank holding companies</h3>
<!-- field-end:head -->
<!-- field-start:statute -->
<h4 class="subsection-head">(a) In general</h4>
<h4 class="paragraph-head">(1) Purpose</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">In order to prevent or mitigate risks to the financial stability of the United States that could arise from the material financial distress, failure, or ongoing activities of large, interconnected financial institutions, the Council may make recommendations to the Board of Governors concerning the establishment and refinement of prudential standards and reporting and disclosure requirements applicable to nonbank financial companies supervised by the Board of Governors and large, interconnected bank holding companies, that&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(A) are more stringent than those applicable to other nonbank financial companies and bank holding companies that do not present similar risks to the financial stability of the United States; and</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(B) increase in stringency, based on the considerations identified in subsection (b)(3).</p>
<h4 class="paragraph-head">(2) Recommended application of required standards</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">In making recommendations under this section, the Council may&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(A) differentiate among companies that are subject to heightened standards on an individual basis or by category, taking into consideration their capital structure, riskiness, complexity, financial activities (including the financial activities of their subsidiaries), size, and any other risk-related <!-- PDFPage:1843 -->factors that the Council deems appropriate; or</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(B) recommend an asset threshold that is higher than the applicable threshold for the application of any standard described in subsections (c) through (g).</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(b) Development of prudential standards</h4>
<h4 class="paragraph-head">(1) In general</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">The recommendations of the Council under subsection (a) may include&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(A) risk-based capital requirements;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(B) leverage limits;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(C) liquidity requirements;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(D) resolution plan and credit exposure report requirements;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(E) concentration limits;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(F) a contingent capital requirement;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(G) enhanced public disclosures;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(H) short-term debt limits; and</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(I) overall risk management requirements.</p>
<h4 class="paragraph-head">(2) Prudential standards for foreign financial companies</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">In making recommendations concerning the standards set forth in paragraph (1) that would apply to foreign nonbank financial companies supervised by the Board of Governors or foreign-based bank holding companies, the Council shall&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(A) give due regard to the principle of national treatment and equality of competitive opportunity; and</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(B) take into account the extent to which the foreign nonbank financial company or foreign-based bank holding company is subject on a consolidated basis to home country standards that are comparable to those applied to financial companies in the United States.</p>
<h4 class="paragraph-head">(3) Considerations</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">In making recommendations concerning prudential standards under paragraph (1), the Council shall&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(A) take into account differences among nonbank financial companies supervised by the Board of Governors and bank holding companies described in subsection (a), based on&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-3em">(i) the factors described in subsections (a) and (b) of section 5323 of this title;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-3em">(ii) whether the company owns an insured depository institution;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-3em">(iii) nonfinancial activities and affiliations of the company; and</p>
<p class="statutory-body-3em">(iv) any other factors that the Council determines appropriate;</p>
<br class="Q04" />
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(B) to the extent possible, ensure that small changes in the factors listed in subsections (a) and (b) of section 5323 of this title would not result in sharp, discontinuous changes in the prudential standards established under section 5365 of this title; and</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(C) adapt its recommendations as appropriate in light of any predominant line of business of such company, including assets under management or other activities for which particular standards may not be appropriate.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(c) Contingent capital</h4>
<h4 class="paragraph-head">(1) Study required</h4>

<h4 class="paragraph-head">(2) Imposition of standards</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">The primary financial regulatory agency shall impose the standards recommended by the Council in accordance with subsection (a), or similar standards that the Council deems acceptable, or shall explain in writing to the Council, not later than 90 days after the date on which the Council issues the recommendation, why the agency has determined not to follow the recommendation of the Council.</p>

<h4 class="paragraph-head">(1) Notice</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">The Council may recommend to the relevant primary financial regulatory agency that a financial activity or practice no longer requires any standards or safeguards implemented under this section.</p>

<!-- field-end:head -->
<!-- field-start:statute -->
<h4 class="subsection-head">(a) In general</h4>
<h4 class="paragraph-head">(1) Purpose</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">In order to prevent or mitigate risks to the financial stability of the United States that could arise from the material financial distress or failure, or ongoing activities, of large, interconnected financial institutions, the Board of Governors shall, on its own or pursuant to recommendations by the Council under section 5325 of this title, establish prudential standards for nonbank financial companies supervised by the Board of Governors and bank holding companies with total consolidated assets equal to or greater than $250,000,000,000 that&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(A) are more stringent than the standards and requirements applicable to nonbank financial companies and bank holding companies that do not present similar risks to the financial stability of the United States; and</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(B) increase in stringency, based on the considerations identified in subsection (b)(3).</p>
<h4 class="paragraph-head">(2) Tailored application</h4>
<h4 class="subparagraph-head">(A) In general</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">In prescribing more stringent prudential standards under this section, the Board of Governors shall, on its own or pursuant to a recommendation by the Council in accordance with section 5325 of this title, differentiate among companies on an individual basis or by category, taking into consideration their capital structure, riskiness, complexity, financial activities (including the financial activities of their subsidiaries), size, and any other risk-related factors that the Board of Governors deems appropriate.</p>
<h4 class="subparagraph-head">(B) Adjustment of threshold for application of certain standards</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">The Board of Governors may, pursuant to a recommendation by the Council in accordance with section 5325 of this title, establish an asset threshold above the applicable threshold for the application of any standard <!-- PDFPage:1858 -->established under subsections (c) through (g).</p>
<h4 class="subparagraph-head">(C) Risks to financial stability and safety and soundness</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">The Board of Governors may by order or rule promulgated pursuant to section 553 of title 5 apply any prudential standard established under this section to any bank holding company or bank holding companies with total consolidated assets equal to or greater than $100,000,000,000 to which the prudential standard does not otherwise apply provided that the Board of Governors&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-3em">(i) determines that application of the prudential standard is appropriate&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-4em">(I) to prevent or mitigate risks to the financial stability of the United States, as described in paragraph (1); or</p>
<p class="statutory-body-4em">(II) to promote the safety and soundness of the bank holding company or bank holding companies; and</p>
<br class="Q04" />
<p class="statutory-body-3em">(ii) takes into consideration the bank holding company's or bank holding companies&apos; capital structure, riskiness, complexity, financial activities (including financial activities of subsidiaries), size, and any other risk-related factors that the Board of Governors deems appropriate.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(b) Development of prudential standards</h4>
<h4 class="paragraph-head">(1) In general</h4>
<h4 class="subparagraph-head">(A) Required standards</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">The Board of Governors shall establish prudential standards for nonbank financial companies supervised by the Board of Governors and bank holding companies described in subsection (a), that shall include&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-3em">(i) risk-based capital requirements and leverage limits, unless the Board of Governors, in consultation with the Council, determines that such requirements are not appropriate for a company subject to more stringent prudential standards because of the activities of such company (such as investment company activities or assets under management) or structure, in which case, the Board of Governors shall apply other standards that result in similarly stringent risk controls;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-3em">(ii) liquidity requirements;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-3em">(iii) overall risk management requirements;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-3em">(iv) resolution plan requirements; and</p>
<p class="statutory-body-3em">(v) concentration limits.</p>
<h4 class="subparagraph-head">(B) Additional standards authorized</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">The Board of Governors may establish additional prudential standards for nonbank financial companies supervised by the Board of Governors and bank holding companies described in subsection (a), that include&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-3em">(i) a contingent capital requirement;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-3em">(ii) enhanced public disclosures, including credit exposure reports;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-3em">(iii) short-term debt limits; and</p>
<p class="statutory-body-3em">(iv) such other prudential standards as the Board or Governors, on its own or pursuant to a recommendation made by the Council in accordance with section 5325 of this title, determines are appropriate.</p>
<h4 class="paragraph-head">(2) Standards for foreign financial companies</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">In applying the standards set forth in paragraph (1) to any foreign nonbank financial company supervised by the Board of Governors or foreign-based bank holding company, the Board of Governors shall&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(A) give due regard to the principle of national treatment and equality of competitive opportunity; and</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(B) take into account the extent to which the foreign financial company is subject on a consolidated basis to home country standards that are comparable to those applied to financial companies in the United States.</p>
<h4 class="paragraph-head">(3) Considerations</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">In prescribing prudential standards under paragraph (1), the Board of Governors shall&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(A) take into account differences among nonbank financial companies supervised by the Board of Governors and bank holding companies described in subsection (a), based on&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-3em">(i) the factors described in subsections (a) and (b) of section 5323 of this title;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-3em">(ii) whether the company owns an insured depository institution;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-3em">(iii) nonfinancial activities and affiliations of the company; and</p>
<p class="statutory-body-3em">(iv) any other risk-related factors that the Board of Governors determines appropriate;</p>
<br class="Q04" />
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(B) to the extent possible, ensure that small changes in the factors listed in subsections (a) and (b) of section 5323 of this title would not result in sharp, discontinuous changes in the prudential standards established under paragraph (1) of this subsection;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(C) take into account any recommendations of the Council under section 5325 of this title; and</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(D) adapt the required standards as appropriate in light of any predominant line of business of such company, including assets under management or other activities for which particular standards may not be appropriate.</p>
<h4 class="paragraph-head">(4) Consultation</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">Before imposing prudential standards or any other requirements pursuant to this section, including notices of deficiencies in resolution plans and more stringent requirements or divestiture orders resulting from such notices, that are likely to have a significant impact on a functionally regulated subsidiary or depository institution subsidiary of a nonbank financial company supervised by the Board of Governors or a bank holding company described in subsection (a), the Board of Governors shall consult with each Council member that primarily supervises any such subsidiary with respect to any such standard or requirement.</p>
<h4 class="paragraph-head">(5) Report</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">The Board of Governors shall submit an annual report to Congress regarding the implementation of the prudential standards required pursuant to paragraph (1), including the use of such standards to mitigate risks to the financial stability of the United States.</p>
<!-- PDFPage:1859 --><h4 class="subsection-head">(c) Contingent capital</h4>
<h4 class="paragraph-head">(1) In general</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">Subsequent to submission by the Council of a report to Congress under section 5325(c) of this title, the Board of Governors may issue regulations that require each nonbank financial company supervised by the Board of Governors and bank holding companies described in subsection (a) to maintain a minimum amount of contingent capital that is convertible to equity in times of financial stress.</p>
<h4 class="paragraph-head">(2) Factors to consider</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">In issuing regulations under this subsection, the Board of Governors shall consider&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(A) the results of the study undertaken by the Council, and any recommendations of the Council, under section 5325(c) of this title;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(B) an appropriate transition period for implementation of contingent capital under this subsection;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(C) the factors described in subsection (b)(3)(A);</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(D) capital requirements applicable to the nonbank financial company supervised by the Board of Governors or a bank holding company described in subsection (a), and subsidiaries thereof; and</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(E) any other factor that the Board of Governors deems appropriate.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(d) Resolution plan and credit exposure reports</h4>
<h4 class="paragraph-head">(1) Resolution plan</h4>

<p class="statutory-body-2em">(B) full descriptions of the ownership structure, assets, liabilities, and contractual obligations of the company;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(C) identification of the cross-guarantees tied to different securities, identification of major counterparties, and a process for determining to whom the collateral of the company is pledged; and</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(D) any other information that the Board of Governors and the Corporation jointly require by rule or order.</p>
<h4 class="paragraph-head">(2) Credit exposure report</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">The Board of Governors may require each nonbank financial company supervised by the Board of Governors and bank holding companies described in subsection (a) to report periodically to the Board of Governors, the Council, and the Corporation on&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(A) the nature and extent to which the company has credit exposure to other significant nonbank financial companies and significant bank holding companies; and</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(B) the nature and extent to which other significant nonbank financial companies and significant bank holding companies have credit exposure to that company.</p>
<h4 class="paragraph-head">(3) Review</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">The Board of Governors and the Corporation shall review the information provided in accordance with this subsection by each nonbank financial company supervised by the Board of Governors and bank holding company described in subsection (a).</p>
<h4 class="paragraph-head">(4) Notice of deficiencies</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">If the Board of Governors and the Corporation jointly determine, based on their review under paragraph (3), that the resolution plan of a nonbank financial company supervised by the Board of Governors or a bank holding company described in subsection (a) is not credible or would not facilitate an orderly resolution of the company under title 11&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(A) the Board of Governors and the Corporation shall notify the company of the deficiencies in the resolution plan; and</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(B) the company shall resubmit the resolution plan within a timeframe determined by the Board of Governors and the Corporation, with revisions demonstrating that the plan is credible and would result in an orderly resolution under title 11, including any proposed changes in business operations and corporate structure to facilitate implementation of the plan.</p>
<h4 class="paragraph-head">(5) Failure to resubmit credible plan</h4>
<h4 class="subparagraph-head">(A) In general</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">If a nonbank financial company supervised by the Board of Governors or a bank holding company described in subsection (a) fails to timely resubmit the resolution plan as required under paragraph (4), with such revisions as are required under subparagraph (B), the Board of Governors and the Corporation may jointly impose more stringent capital, leverage, or liquidity requirements, or restrictions on the growth, activities, or operations of the company, or any subsidiary thereof, until such time as the company resubmits a plan that remedies the deficiencies.</p>
<h4 class="subparagraph-head">(B) Divestiture</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">The Board of Governors and the Corporation, in consultation with the Council, may jointly direct a nonbank financial company supervised by the Board of Governors or a bank holding company described in subsection (a), by order, to divest certain assets or operations identified by the Board of Governors and the Corporation, to facilitate an orderly resolution of such company under title 11, in the event of the failure of such company, in any case in which&mdash;</p>

<p class="statutory-body-3em">(ii) the company has failed, within the 2-year period beginning on the date of the imposition of such requirements under subparagraph (A), to resubmit the resolu<!-- PDFPage:1860 -->tion plan with such revisions as were required under paragraph (4)(B).</p>
