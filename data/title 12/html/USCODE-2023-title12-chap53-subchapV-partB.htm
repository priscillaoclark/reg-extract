<h4 class="subparagraph-head">(B) Deference</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">Notwithstanding any power granted to any Federal agency or to the Council under this title,<sup><a href="#5512_1_target" name="5512_1">1</a></sup> and subject to section 5581(b)(5)(E) of this title, the deference that a court affords to the Bureau with respect to a determination by the Bureau regarding the meaning or interpretation of any provision of a Federal consumer financial law shall be applied as if the Bureau were the only agency authorized <!-- PDFPage:1957 -->to apply, enforce, interpret, or administer the provisions of such Federal consumer financial law.</p>
