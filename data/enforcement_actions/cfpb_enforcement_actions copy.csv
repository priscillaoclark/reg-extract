"Climb Credit, Inc.; Climb Investco, LLC; Climb GS Loan Fund 2018-1, LLC; 1/0 Holdco LLC; and 1/0 Capital LLC",https://www.consumerfinance.gov/enforcement/actions/climb-credit-inc-et-al/,2024-10-17T00:00:00,"On October 17, 2024, the Bureau filed a lawsuit against Climb Credit, Inc.; its wholly owned subsidiary Climb Investco, LLC; its wholly owned sub-subsidiary Climb GS Loan Fund 2018-1, LLC; and the originators, initial owners, and initial operators of these entities, 1/0 Holdco LLC and 1/0 Capital LLC.","On October 17, 2024, the Bureau filed a lawsuit against Climb Credit, Inc.; its wholly owned subsidiary Climb Investco, LLC; its wholly owned sub-subsidiary Climb GS Loan Fund 2018-1, LLC; and the originators, initial owners, and initial operators of these entities, 1/0 Holdco LLC and 1/0 Capital LLC. 1/0 Holdco LLC and 1/0 Capital LLC are headquartered in New York and Climb Credit, Inc. was headquartered in New York during most of the time period relevant to this suit and continues to conduct a significant amount of its operations there. The Bureau alleges these entities (the Climb Enterprise) worked together in online student lending for short-term vocational programs at schools with whom Climb Credit, Inc. has partnered. The Bureau further alleges that, through numerous statements since at least 2017, the Climb Enterprise assured consumers that if a Climb loan was available to fund tuition for a school’s educational program, the consumer could trust that the Climb Enterprise had vetted the quality of that program and school. The Climb Enterprise positioned Climb Credit, Inc. as a trusted intermediary by presenting it as a company that prospective borrowers could rely upon to act in their interests by identifying quality educational programs and schools. In fact, however, as the Bureau alleges, the Climb Enterprise offered loans for many programs and schools that it had not vetted for quality. This practice sought to maximize the Climb Enterprise’s revenue by inducing consumers to take out loans without regard to the actual quality of the programs offered. The Bureau asserts the Climb Enterprise violated the Consumer Financial Protection Act of 2010 (CFPA) by engaging in abusive acts and practices in taking unreasonable advantage of consumers’ reliance on the Climb Enterprise’s representations as to the programs and schools; violated the CFPA through deceptive acts and practices regarding the Climb Enterprise’s vetting of schools and the outcomes for consumers who attended the schools; violated the Truth in Lending Act (TILA) and Regulation Z by failing to disclose finance charges on loan documents and annual percentage rates on advertisements; violated TILA and Regulation Z by using the names, emblems, or logos of certain schools to imply that they endorsed Climb loans; and violated the CFPA by committing acts or practices in violation of TILA and Regulation Z. The Bureau seeks, among other things, injunctive relief to prevent future violations and monetary relief in the form of redress to consumers and the imposition of civil money penalties.","[{'text': 'Complaint', 'link': 'https://files.consumerfinance.gov/f/documents/cfpb_climb-credit-complaint_2024-10.pdf'}, {'text': 'CFPB Sues Student Lender Climb Credit and Investment Firm 1/0 for Deceiving Borrowers About Coding Bootcamps and Vocational Programs', 'link': '/about-us/newsroom/cfpb-sues-student-lender-climb-credit-and-investment-firm-1-0-for-deceiving-borrowers-about-coding-bootcamps-and-vocational-programs/'}]",https://www.consumerfinance.gov/about-us/newsroom/cfpb-sues-student-lender-climb-credit-and-investment-firm-1-0-for-deceiving-borrowers-about-coding-bootcamps-and-vocational-programs/,,['Civil Action'],1:24-cv-07868,"OCT 17, 2024",Pending Litigation,['Student Loan Origination']
Fairway Independent Mortgage Corporation,https://www.consumerfinance.gov/enforcement/actions/fairway-independent-mortgage-corporation/,2024-10-15T00:00:00,"On October 15, 2024, the Bureau, together with the United States Department of Justice, filed a complaint and proposed consent order to resolve their allegations against Fairway Independent Mortgage Corporation.","On October 15, 2024, the Bureau, together with the United States Department of Justice (DOJ), filed a complaint and proposed consent order to resolve their allegations against Fairway Independent Mortgage Corporation (Fairway). Fairway is incorporated in Texas and headquartered in Madison, Wisconsin. Fairway acquired mortgage company, MortgageBanc, in 2009, and since 2009, Fairway has operated in the Birmingham-Hoover, AL Metropolitan Statistical Area (Birmingham MSA) under the trade name MortgageBanc. The Bureau’s and DOJ’s joint complaint alleges that Fairway engaged in unlawful discrimination against applicants and prospective applicants, including by redlining majority-Black and high-Black areas in the Birmingham MSA and engaging in acts and practices directed at applicants and prospective applicants that would discourage a reasonable person from making or pursuing an application for credit on the basis of race or color in violation of the Equal Credit Opportunity Act, Regulation B, and the Consumer Financial Protection Act of 2010. DOJ also alleges that Fairway’s conduct violated the Fair Housing Act. If entered by the court, the proposed consent order would require Fairway to invest $7 million in a loan subsidy program under which Fairway must offer home purchase, refinance, and home improvement loans on a more affordable basis than otherwise available for certain residential properties located in majority-Black neighborhoods in the Birmingham MSA. Fairway must also open or acquire a new loan production office or full-service retail office in a majority-Black neighborhood in the Birmingham MSA. Fairway must also spend at least $500,000 on advertising and outreach, at least $250,000 on consumer education, at least $250,000 on partnerships with one or more community-based or governmental organizations, and take other remedial steps, to serve the credit needs of majority-Black neighborhoods in the Birmingham MSA. Fairway must also pay a civil money penalty of $1.9 million.","[{'text': 'Complaint', 'link': 'https://files.consumerfinance.gov/f/documents/cfpb_fairway-complaint_2024-10.pdf'}, {'text': 'Proposed Consent Order', 'link': 'https://files.consumerfinance.gov/f/documents/cfpb_fairway-proposed-consent-order_2024-10.pdf'}, {'text': 'CFPB and Justice Department Take Action Against Fairway for Redlining Black Neighborhoods in Birmingham, Alabama', 'link': '/about-us/newsroom/cfpb-and-justice-department-take-action-against-fairway-for-redlining-black-neighborhoods-in-birmingham-alabama/'}]",https://www.consumerfinance.gov/about-us/newsroom/cfpb-and-justice-department-take-action-against-fairway-for-redlining-black-neighborhoods-in-birmingham-alabama/,,['Civil Action'],2:24-cv-01405,"OCT 15, 2024",Pending Litigation,"['Fair Lending', 'Mortgage Origination']"
