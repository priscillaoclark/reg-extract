    "description": "On October 31, 2024, the Bureau issued an order against VyStar Credit Union (VyStar), a Jacksonville, Florida based credit union with approximately 850,000 members with deposit accounts. VyStar membership is open to, among others, those living or working in the 49 contiguous counties of Central to North Florida, 29 Georgia counties, and past and present military members and their families. In May 2022, VyStar attempted to launch a new online and mobile banking platform with a new and untested provider. The new system crashed upon launch because VyStar brought it online prematurely and failed to establish or follow critical processes to ensure its success. The online and mobile banking platform was taken offline soon after the conversion; and initially when it returned, it lacked key banking services, some of which were not restored for months. The outage and subsequent limited functionality of the banking platform impacted VyStar members in significant ways, including the assessment of fees for failures to make timely payments, restricted access to their funds, and the inability to effectively manage their accounts. These significant problems were foreseeable and avoidable. VyStar failed to have adequate system development, implementation, and release controls in place; maintained policies and procedures that were deficient, out of date, and not followed by senior management; and was deficient in its service provider oversight. VyStar pushed the conversion process through too quickly, despite warning signs from its own development team, to meet an unrealistic deadline, which caused VyStar to take on unnecessary risk of harm to its members. The Bureau found that VyStar\u2019s planning and implementation of the conversion constituted an unfair practice in violation of the Consumer Financial Protection Act of 2010 that caused financial and non-financial harm to VyStar\u2019s members, including fees, costs, and inconvenience. The order requires VyStar to come into compliance with the law, establish a governance committee to ensure proper management of projects involving consumer facing banking systems, ensure that all consumers owed redress have been paid, and pay a $1.5 million civil money penalty.",

    "description": "On October 23, 2024, the Bureau issued an order against Goldman Sachs Bank USA (Goldman). In December 2017, Goldman and Apple Inc. entered an agreement to offer Apple Card, a credit card integrated with Apple software that offers both market-rate APRs and interest-free financing for qualifying Apple products. Goldman agreed to extend the credit offered through Apple Card and to investigate disputes submitted by consumers. Apple designed the consumer-facing interfaces that consumers used to manage Apple Card accounts on Apple devices and developed the creative approach and design of Apple Card advertisements. Despite warnings to Goldman\u2019s board on August 16, 2019 that the Apple Card disputes system was \u201cnot fully ready\u201d due to technological issues, Goldman and Apple introduced the Apple card four days later on August 20, 2019. The Bureau found that Goldman violated the Truth in Lending Act and Regulation Z by failing to send acknowledgement notices and resolution letters within the required periods; making adverse reports to consumer reporting agencies regarding amounts disputed in billing error notices prior to completing the requirements for billing error resolution; failing to conduct reasonable investigations for disputes that qualified as billing error notices; and holding consumers liable for amounts at issue in claims of unauthorized use before conducting a reasonable investigation. The Bureau also found that Goldman violated the Consumer Financial Protection Act of 2010 by engaging in unfair acts or practices through its delay in resolving transaction disputes. Separately, in December 2019, Goldman and Apple introduced Apple Card Monthly Installments (ACMI), which allowed Apple Card users to finance the purchase of certain Apple devices directly from Apple through the payment of interest-free monthly installments. The Bureau found that Goldman engaged in deceptive acts or practices by misleading consumers to expect that purchases of Apple devices would automatically be enrolled in ACMI, and by misleading consumers enrolled in ACMI about the application of refunds to Apple Card accounts with both ACMI and non-ACMI balances. The order requires Goldman to pay $19.8 million in redress to consumers and a $45 million civil money penalty and to come into compliance with the law.",

    "description": "On October 17, 2024, the Bureau filed a lawsuit against Climb Credit, Inc.; its wholly owned subsidiary Climb Investco, LLC; its wholly owned sub-subsidiary Climb GS Loan Fund 2018-1, LLC; and the originators, initial owners, and initial operators of these entities, 1/0 Holdco LLC and 1/0 Capital LLC. 1/0 Holdco LLC and 1/0 Capital LLC are headquartered in New York and Climb Credit, Inc. was headquartered in New York during most of the time period relevant to this suit and continues to conduct a significant amount of its operations there. The Bureau alleges these entities (the Climb Enterprise) worked together in online student lending for short-term vocational programs at schools with whom Climb Credit, Inc. has partnered. The Bureau further alleges that, through numerous statements since at least 2017, the Climb Enterprise assured consumers that if a Climb loan was available to fund tuition for a school\u2019s educational program, the consumer could trust that the Climb Enterprise had vetted the quality of that program and school. The Climb Enterprise positioned Climb Credit, Inc. as a trusted intermediary by presenting it as a company that prospective borrowers could rely upon to act in their interests by identifying quality educational programs and schools. In fact, however, as the Bureau alleges, the Climb Enterprise offered loans for many programs and schools that it had not vetted for quality. This practice sought to maximize the Climb Enterprise\u2019s revenue by inducing consumers to take out loans without regard to the actual quality of the programs offered. The Bureau asserts the Climb Enterprise violated the Consumer Financial Protection Act of 2010 (CFPA) by engaging in abusive acts and practices in taking unreasonable advantage of consumers\u2019 reliance on the Climb Enterprise\u2019s representations as to the programs and schools; violated the CFPA through deceptive acts and practices regarding the Climb Enterprise\u2019s vetting of schools and the outcomes for consumers who attended the schools; violated the Truth in Lending Act (TILA) and Regulation Z by failing to disclose finance charges on loan documents and annual percentage rates on advertisements; violated TILA and Regulation Z by using the names, emblems, or logos of certain schools to imply that they endorsed Climb loans; and violated the CFPA by committing acts or practices in violation of TILA and Regulation Z. The Bureau seeks, among other things, injunctive relief to prevent future violations and monetary relief in the form of redress to consumers and the imposition of civil money penalties.",

    "description": "On October 15, 2024, the Bureau, together with the United States Department of Justice (DOJ), filed a complaint and proposed consent order to resolve their allegations against Fairway Independent Mortgage Corporation (Fairway). Fairway is incorporated in Texas and headquartered in Madison, Wisconsin. Fairway acquired mortgage company, MortgageBanc, in 2009, and since 2009, Fairway has operated in the Birmingham-Hoover, AL Metropolitan Statistical Area (Birmingham MSA) under the trade name MortgageBanc. The Bureau\u2019s and DOJ\u2019s joint complaint alleges that Fairway engaged in unlawful discrimination against applicants and prospective applicants, including by redlining majority-Black and high-Black areas in the Birmingham MSA and engaging in acts and practices directed at applicants and prospective applicants that would discourage a reasonable person from making or pursuing an application for credit on the basis of race or color in violation of the Equal Credit Opportunity Act, Regulation B, and the Consumer Financial Protection Act of 2010. DOJ also alleges that Fairway\u2019s conduct violated the Fair Housing Act. If entered by the court, the proposed consent order would require Fairway to invest $7 million in a loan subsidy program under which Fairway must offer home purchase, refinance, and home improvement loans on a more affordable basis than otherwise available for certain residential properties located in majority-Black neighborhoods in the Birmingham MSA. Fairway must also open or acquire a new loan production office or full-service retail office in a majority-Black neighborhood in the Birmingham MSA. Fairway must also spend at least $500,000 on advertising and outreach, at least $250,000 on consumer education, at least $250,000 on partnerships with one or more community-based or governmental organizations, and take other remedial steps, to serve the credit needs of majority-Black neighborhoods in the Birmingham MSA. Fairway must also pay a civil money penalty of $1.9 million.",

    "description": "On October 10, 2024, the Bureau issued an order against Ejudicate, Inc., d/b/a Brief, a company based in Los Angeles, California. Ejudicate is a private arbitration company that offers an online dispute resolution platform. In April 2022, Ejudicate commenced arbitration proceedings against consumers who had not agreed to be subjected to Ejudicate\u2019s authority. These arbitration proceedings related to consumers\u2019 alleged default on income share loans that had been extended by Prehired, LLC (Prehired), which operated an online training program. Prehired was the subject of a separate Bureaulaw enforcement action. The Bureau found that Ejudicate engaged in unfair acts and practices in violation of the Consumer Financial Protection Act of 2010 (CFPA) by commencing arbitration proceedings without consumers\u2019 consent. In fact, Ejudicate knew it did not have jurisdiction over Prehired\u2019s claims because none of the income share loans contained an arbitration clause permitting arbitration by Ejudicate. The Bureau also found that Ejudicate committed deceptive acts and practices in violation of the CFPA by misrepresenting Ejudicate\u2019s neutrality, the nature of the arbitration proceedings, and the consequences of consumers\u2019 actions or inactions in the Ejudicate forum. For example, Ejudicate falsely represented itself as a neutral and impartial forum for consumer debt arbitrations and failed to disclose that Ejudicate had financial interests aligned with the creditor, Prehired, which filed the claim against the consumer. Finally, the Bureau found that Ejudicate engaged in unfair acts and practices in violation of the CFPA by unlawfully attempting to bind consumers to Ejudicate\u2019s terms of service and platform rules, which infringed on consumers\u2019 ability to defend themselves against the claims lodged against them. The order permanently bans Ejudicate from arbitrating disputes that concern a consumer financial product or service. The order also prohibits Ejudicate from making misrepresentations to consumers in connection with any consumer financial product or service. Ejudicate must pay a civil money penalty of $1, an amount that accounts for Ejudicate\u2019s inability to pay more based on sworn financial statements that it provided to the Bureau.",

    "description": "On September 13, 2024, the Bureau filed a lawsuit against Reliant Holdings, Inc. (Reliant), d/b/a Horizon Card Services and Robert Kane, its sole shareholder, owner, and chief executive officer. Reliant offered consumers nationwide enrollment in a program called the Horizon Card Services membership in exchange for periodic fees. The primary product included with the membership was an unsecured, open-end line of credit, typically starting at $500 or $750. Until at least January 2021, Reliant often charged fees of at least 60% of the credit limit by charging consumers around $24.95 a month or $299.40 annually for the membership. Although marketed as a regular credit card, the line of credit could be used only to purchase goods from Reliant\u2019s online store, the Horizon Outlet. The outlet had a limited selection of overpriced or off-brand goods. Between 2017 and 2021, only 6% of consumers ever used their cards at the outlet. Despite promises that consumers could obtain a full refund in \u201cless than a minute,\u201d Reliant routinely made consumers endure a series of offers before canceling and refused to provide full refunds unless consumers threatened to seek relief from their bank or the Better Business Bureau. The Bureau alleges that Reliant and Kane engaged in deceptive acts and practices in violation of the Consumer Financial Protection Act of 2010 (CFPA) by marketing the membership as a regular credit card that could be used anywhere that credit cards are accepted, when in fact it was a membership program with a credit card that only could be used to purchase goods from the Horizon Outlet; and for falsely promising that consumers could obtain a full refund in \u201cless than a minute.\u201d The Bureau further alleges that Reliant and Kane engaged in abusive acts and practices in violation of the CFPA by taking unreasonable advantage of customers\u2019 inability to cancel membership enrollment and obtain refunds. The Bureau also alleges that until at least January 2021, Reliant violated the Truth in Lending Act and its implementing regulation, Regulation Z, by unlawfully requiring consumers to pay more than 25% of the credit limit during the first year of account opening. The Bureau seeks, among other things, injunctive relief against Reliant and Kane to prevent future violations and monetary relief in the form of redress to consumers and the imposition of civil money penalties.",

    "description": "On September 11, 2024, the Bureau issued an order against TD Bank, N.A., a national bank headquartered in Cherry Hill, New Jersey. TD Bank furnishes credit information on consumer credit card accounts by sending monthly data files to consumer reporting agencies. TD Bank also furnishes consumer deposit account information to nationwide specialty consumer reporting agencies. The Bureau found that over several years TD Bank repeatedly furnished to consumer reporting agencies information containing numerous systemic errors and that it knew of many of these inaccuracies for a year or more before fixing them. In addition, the Bureau found that, for years, TD Bank failed to conduct reasonable and timely investigations of consumer disputes, including sometimes by not conducting any investigation at all. When TD Bank furnished inaccurate consumer information, it may have negatively affected consumers\u2019 access to credit. Specifically, the Bureau found that with respect to its credit card accounts, TD Bank violated the Fair Credit Reporting Act (FCRA) and its implementing regulation, Regulation V, by failing to promptly correct and update information it furnished to consumer reporting agencies that it determined was not complete or accurate; failing to accurately report consumers\u2019 participation in COVID-19 accommodations programs pursuant to the CARES Act; failing to provide the FCRA-required date of first delinquency on certain delinquent or charged-off accounts; failing to conduct reasonable and timely investigations of consumer disputes, including sometimes by not conducting any investigation at all; failing to properly notify consumers when deeming a dispute frivolous or irrelevant; and failing to establish and implement reasonable written policies and procedures regarding the information furnished to consumer reporting agencies. The Bureau also found that TD Bank\u2019s failure to investigate consumer disputes and decision to divert resources away from investigating disputes took unreasonable advantage of the inability of consumers to protect their interest in accurate consumer reporting and was therefore abusive in violation of the Consumer Financial Protection Act of 2010. The Bureau further found that TD Bank violated FCRA and Regulation V with respect to consumer deposit accounts by failing to sufficiently maintain and implement written policies and procedures for furnishing and by failing to promptly correct furnished information after it determined the furnished information was fraudulent. The order requires TD Bank to take steps to prevent future violations and to pay $7.76 million in redress to affected consumers and a $20 million civil money penalty.",

Since at least 2015, NewDay USA has provided cash-out refinance loans to consumers, including veterans and active-duty members, many of whom had lower than average credit scores and carry consumer debt. Certain states in which NewDay USA offered its cash-out refinances required lenders to complete a borrower \u201cnet benefit\u201d analysis worksheet showing the financial benefit of a refinance to a borrower. The Bureau found that NewDay USA engaged in deceptive acts and practices in violation of the Consumer Financial Protection Act of 2010 by consistently misstating in the net benefit worksheets provided to borrowers in North Carolina and Maine up through 2020, and Minnesota up through 2018, how borrowers\u2019 \u201cprevious\u201d monthly mortgage payment would compare to the \u201cnew\u201d monthly mortgage payment after refinancing with NewDay USA.

    "description": "On August 21, 2024, the Bureau issued an order against Fay Servicing, LLC, a residential mortgage servicer headquartered in Tampa, Florida. On June 7, 2017, the Bureaupreviously issued an orderagainst Fay Servicing to address the Bureau\u2019s findings that Fay Servicing failed to provide mortgage borrowers with the protections against foreclosure required by law, kept borrowers in the dark about critical information about the process for applying for foreclosure relief, and moved forward with the foreclosure process while borrowers were actively seeking help to save their homes. In this action, the Bureau found that Fay Servicing violated the Bureau\u2019s 2017 order, Regulation X, which implements the Real Estate Settlement Procedures Act, and the Consumer Financial Protection Act of 2010 (CFPA) by, among other things, taking prohibited foreclosure actions against borrowers engaged in loss mitigation and preventing borrowers from taking advantage of all loss mitigation options available to them. Specifically, the Bureau found that Fay Servicing failed to implement the 2017 Order\u2019s requirements, including ensuring that it did not engage in prohibited foreclosure activity; properly maintaining data about borrowers\u2019 loss mitigation applications; and developing written policies and procedures to ensure compliance. The Bureau also found that Fay Servicing engaged in additional violations of Regulation X by engaging in prohibited foreclosure activity against borrowers entitled to foreclosure protections and failing to maintain adequate policies and procedures. The Bureau also found that Fay Servicing engaged in unfair practices by failing to inform borrowers how their indicated preference for retention or non-retention options, or lack thereof, could limit available loss mitigation options. Finally, the Bureau found that Fay Servicing violated multiple provisions of the Homeowners Protection Act, Regulation X, Regulation Z (which implements the Truth in Lending Act), and the CFPA\u2019s prohibition on unfair and deceptive practices in its administration of private mortgage insurance and assessment of late fees. The order requires Fay Servicing to stop its illegal practices and improve its servicing technology and compliance management systems. The order also puts limitations on compensation to Edward Fay, Fay Servicing\u2019s founder, CEO, and Chairman of the Board, if Edward Fay does not take actions necessary to ensure compliance with the order. The order also requires Fay Servicing to pay $3 million in consumer redress, a $2 million civil money penalty, and to invest $2 million to update its servicing technology and compliance management systems.",

Acima purports to offer consumers nationwide a means to \u201clease-to-own\u201d consumer goods at the point of purchase online and in stores. The Bureau alleges that Acima\u2019s purported \u201cleases\u201d were actually credit, and that Acima and Allred violated the Consumer Financial Protection Act\u2019s (CFPA) prohibition against unfair, deceptive, and abusive acts and practices by: misleading consumers regarding the nature and terms of Acima\u2019s agreements, including their exorbitant cost; materially interfering with consumers\u2019 ability to understand the terms and conditions of those agreements; effectively locking consumers into these high-cost financing arrangements by making it difficult for consumers to terminate them and creating unfair barriers to returns; misrepresenting consumers\u2019 ability to return goods and the means by which returns could be accomplished; misrepresenting to consumers that their contracts required the maintenance of \u201cautopay\u201d; and providing deceptive advertisements and training to merchants, that created the likelihood that merchants would misrepresent the terms of Acima\u2019s agreements, mislead consumers about the ease of returns, and create confusion about whether Acima\u2019s product was credit or a lease. The Bureau alleges that Allred was directly involved in and \u201csubstantially assisted\u201d Acima\u2019s violations of the CFPA. The Bureau also alleges that Acima violated the Fair Credit Reporting Act (FCRA) and its implementing Regulation V by furnishing inaccurate information about its customers to consumer reporting agencies (CRAs); failing to establish and implement reasonable written policies and procedures regarding the accuracy and integrity of information it furnished to CRAs; failing to conduct reasonable investigations of furnishing disputes; and failing to notify consumers when it reported negative information about them to CRAs. The Bureau also alleges that Acima violated the Truth in Lending Act and its implementing Regulation Z by failing to provide required disclosures to consumers, including the annual percentage rate and finance charges. The Bureau further alleges that Acima violated the Electronic Fund Transfer Act and its implementing Regulation E by conditioning their extension of credit to consumers on repayment by preauthorized electronic fund transfers. Finally, the Bureau alleges in the alternative that, if Acima did not extend credit to consumers, Acima and Allred misrepresented that Acima\u2019s agreements were credit and violated FCRA by using and obtaining consumer reports without a permissible purpose or consumer authorization. The Bureau seeks, among other things, injunctive relief against Acima and Allred to prevent future violations and monetary relief in the form of redress to consumers and the imposition of civil money penalties.",

    "description": "On July 9, 2024, the Bureau issued an order against Fifth Third Bank, N.A. (Fifth Third), a national bank that, among other things, offers and services motor vehicle loans to consumers directly and through a variety of vehicle dealers. Typically, when borrowers obtained a loan from Fifth Third, borrowers signed agreements that required them to maintain insurance that would cover physical damage to the vehicle that served as collateral for the loan. If borrowers did not maintain that insurance coverage, Fifth Third could force-place physical-damage coverage on the vehicle, otherwise known as force-placed insurance. Over 50% of the policies Fifth Third force placed were charged to borrowers who had either always maintained their own insurance or obtained the requisite insurance within a 30-day timeframe of their prior policy lapsing. The Bureau found that Fifth Third\u2019s placing duplicative and unnecessary force-placed insurance on motor vehicle loans; charging premiums for force-placed-insurance policies that had terminated; and failing to provide sufficient notice to consumers of increased monthly payments due to force-placed insurance was unfair in violation of the Consumer Financial Protection Act of 2010 (CFPA). Despite the high number of unnecessary and duplicative force-placed insurance policies and its deficient notice and cancellation processes, Fifth Third continued to force place insurance for years, demanding that consumers pay for insurance they did not need or else face delinquency, additional fees, and even repossession. From 2011 through 2019, Fifth Third force-placed or maintained unnecessary duplicative insurance over 37,000 times. The Bureau also found that Fifth Third made deceptive representations to borrowers about the time required to cancel force-placed-insurance policies and about the total amount due in right-to-cure letters, subjecting borrowers to delinquency-related fees. The Bureau further found that Fifth Third violated the Fair Credit Reporting Act by furnishing inaccurate information to consumer reporting agencies regarding repossessions. Finally, the Bureau found that Fifth Third failed to notify consumers of increases in the amounts of preauthorized electronic-fund transfers due to force-placed insurance, in violation of the Electronic Fund Transfer Act and Regulation E. The order requires Fifth Third to come into compliance with the law, pay redress, and pay a $5 million civil money penalty.",

    "description": "On May 31, 2024, the Bureau filed a lawsuit against the Pennsylvania Higher Education Assistance Agency (PHEAA), a student loan servicer and guaranty agency headquartered in Harrisburg, Pennsylvania, which does business as American Education Services or AES. AES is one of the nation\u2019s largest servicers of private student loans. The Bureau alleges that AES fails to recognize that some private student loans are discharged in bankruptcy and lacks policies and procedures to identify which private loans it services have been discharged by a bankruptcy court\u2019s order of discharge. As a result, AES treats certain private student loans that were discharged as though the consumer still owes those debts such that consumers pay thousands of dollars they did not owe. The Bureau alleges that by failing to maintain policies and procedures to determine whether the education loans it services are discharged in bankruptcy and collecting and furnishing on discharged debts, AES has engaged in unfair, deceptive, and abusive acts or practices in violation of the Consumer Financial Act of 2010. The Bureau further alleges that AES violated Regulation V, the implementing regulation for the Fair Credit Reporting Act, by failing to establish policies or procedures regarding furnishing loans that were discharged in bankruptcy. The Bureau seeks injunctive relief, consumer redress, a civil money penalty, and other appropriate relief.",

The Bureau found that Western Benefits Group violated the Telemarketing Sales Rule (TSR) by charging advance fees for student-loan debt-relief services. The Bureau also found that Western Benefits Group violated the Consumer Financial Protection Act of 2010 (CFPA) and the TSR by using deceptive acts or practices in the marketing and sale of its services. Specifically, the Bureau found that Western Benefits Group misrepresented that it was endorsed, sponsored, or affiliated with the Department of Education; that fees paid by consumers would be applied towards paying off their student loans; and that its services would help consumers consolidate their student loans, would help lower consumers\u2019 monthly student-loan payments, or would help consumers achieve loan forgiveness. The Bureau found that since 2016, Western Benefits Group\u2019s practices caused approximately 5,970 consumers a total of approximately $974,590 in harm, reflecting the total fees they paid, less any refunds. The Bureau\u2019s order requires Western Benefits Group to permanently cease all operations, voids agreements with consumers relating to student-loan debt-relief, and prohibits assessing or collecting fees under those agreements. The Bureau\u2019s order also requires Western Benefits Group to pay a civil money penalty of $400,000 to the Bureau.",

    "description": "On May 17, 2024, the Bureau filed a lawsuit against SoLo Funds, Inc. (SoLo), a fintech company that operates a nationwide website and mobile-application based peer-to-peer lending platform through which consumers can obtain small-dollar, short-term loans. SoLo markets its lending platform to consumers as a consumer-friendly alternative to high-cost, short-term loans. According to SoLo\u2019s website, the SoLo Platform has disbursed over a million loans since 2018. The Bureau alleges that SoLo\u2019s advertisements and loan disclosures tout no-interest loans when, in fact, virtually all loans on the SoLo Platform include a lender \u201ctip\u201d that goes to the lender, a SoLo \u201cdonation\u201d that goes to SoLo, or both. The Bureau alleges that SoLo also misrepresented key terms about the total cost of credit in its promissory notes and disclosures. The Bureau also alleges that SoLo materially interfered with consumers\u2019 ability to understand what fees they were required to pay by obscuring consumer\u2019s ability to opt out of a SoLo \u201cdonation.\u201d Further, the Bureau alleges that SoLo engaged in unfair, deceptive, and abusive conduct by servicing and collecting on loans that are void and uncollectible because they were either made without a required state license or in excess of state usury caps in the state where the borrower resides. When collecting on debt, the Bureau alleges that SoLo has also misrepresented to consumers that it will furnish negative information to credit bureaus when, in fact, it never did. The Bureau alleges this conduct violated the Consumer Financial Protection Act of 2010 (CFPA). The Bureau further alleges that SoLo violated the Fair Credit Reporting Act by not implementing reasonable procedures to assure the maximum possible accuracy of its proprietary credit score, \u201cSoLo Score,\u201d which it provided to lenders to evaluate prospective borrowers, as well as information regarding the number of loans a borrower repaid. The Bureau seeks, among other things, injunctions against SoLo to prevent future violations, monetary relief in the form of redress to consumers, disgorgement of ill-gotten gains, and damages, and the imposition of civil money penalties.",

When consumers\u2019 checking and savings accounts are closed, in most instances, Chime automatically refunds remaining balances (over $1) by check. The Bureau found that Chime failed to refund consumers\u2019 balances within 14 days in thousands of instances, including thousands of instances when Chime failed to issue consumer refunds within 90 days. Consumers who do not have access to funds in their bank accounts often are unable to pay for basic living expenses, like groceries, gas, and housing. To meet these needs, consumers likely have to use or search for alternate sources of funds, such as credit cards and payday loans, which can be expensive. The Bureau found that Chime\u2019s conduct was unfair in violation of the Consumer Financial Protection Act of 2010. The order requires Chime to come into compliance, pay a $3.25 million civil money penalty, and pay at least $1.3 million in redress to consumers.",

    "description": "On May 6, 2024, the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau filed a complaint and two proposed stipulated final judgments to resolve the Bureau\u2019s claims against the National Collegiate Student Loan Trusts (the Trusts) and the Pennsylvania Higher Education Assistance Agency d/b/a American Education Services (PHEAA), respectively. PHEAA is a student loan servicer and has been the primary servicer for loans held by the Trusts since at least 2006. The Bureau alleges that the Trusts and PHEAA violated the Consumer Financial Protection Act of 2010\u2019s (CFPA) prohibition on unfair and deceptive acts and practices in connection with their multi-year failures to properly process and respond to student loan servicing requests from student borrowers, including requests for relief as a result of the COVID-19 pandemic. Specifically, the Bureau alleges that: (1) defendants misrepresented that borrower requests would be answered when, in fact, they would not; (2) the Trusts failed to put into effect a functioning process for deciding borrower requests; (3) PHEAA failed to grant natural disaster forbearance in connection with the COVID-19 pandemic; and (4) PHEAA failed to inform borrowers seeking COVID-19 forbearance of available payment relief options and other key information about the Trusts\u2019 failures. If entered by the court, the stipulated final judgments will require the Trusts and PHEAA to pay $400,000 and $1.75 million in civil money penalties, respectively, and pay nearly $3 million in redress to affected consumers. The orders also would require significant non-monetary relief, including granting certain pending borrower requests, correcting credit reporting, and ceasing debt collection activities; they would also impose injunctive relief requiring, among other things, the implementation of a functional process going forward for processing of student borrower requests.",

    "description": "On April 17, 2024, the Bureau issued an order against BloomTech, Inc., a for-profit vocational school that is also known as the Bloom Institute of Technology and was formerly known as the Lambda School, and Austen Allred, the company\u2019s founder and CEO. BloomTech provides short-term, six- to nine-month training programs in areas such as web development, data science, and backend engineering. To finance its substantial $20,000 tuition, until 2024, BloomTech offered students income share agreements. Under the agreements, students could attend BloomTech if they agreed to pay the school a percentage of their monthly income from a qualifying job with an income of at least $50,000 after they graduate. Nearly all BloomTech\u2019s students funded their enrollment in its programs with such agreements. The Bureau found that BloomTech and Allred made false representations about the income share agreements and the benefits students would receive if they entered them, including that the agreements were not loans and carried no finance charge, that the school\u2019s interests were aligned with its students\u2019 interests because the school got paid only when students got a high-enough paying job, and that the school had high job-placement rates and a top-notch curriculum and instructors. The Bureau found that BloomTech and Allred violated the Consumer Financial Protection Act of 2010\u2019s prohibition of deceptive and abusive acts or practices with its deceptive statements and by taking unreasonable advantage of consumers\u2019 reasonable reliance on BloomTech to act in their interests. The Bureau also found that BloomTech violated the Truth in Lending Act and its implementing regulation, Regulation Z, by failing to disclose key facts about its financing agreements, such as the amount financed, finance charge, and annual percentage rate; and that BloomTech violated the Holder Rule by failing to include a provision in its financing agreements making any holder of the agreement subject to the legal claims that students could assert against BloomTech. The Bureau\u2019s order permanently bans BloomTech from all consumer-lending activities and bans Allred from any student-lending activities for ten years. It also rescinds income share agreements for graduates who have not had a qualifying job in the past year; reforms income share agreements to eliminate the finance charge for consumers who graduated the program more than 18 months ago and obtained a qualifying job making $70,000 or less; and gives current students the option to withdraw from the program and cancel their income share agreement or continue in the program with a third-party loan or lawful income share agreement. The order also requires that BloomTech and Allred pay civil money penalties of $64,235 and $100,000, respectively.",

    "description": "On January 10, 2024, the Bureau and seven state attorneys general\u2014New York, Colorado, Delaware, Illinois, Minnesota, North Carolina, and Wisconsin\u2014filed a complaint and sought a temporary restraining order and preliminary injunction against StratFS, LLC f/k/a Strategic Financial Solutions, LLC, as well as its holding company Strategic Family, Inc.; various of its subsidiaries: Strategic Client Support, LLC; Strategic CS, LLC; Strategic FS Buffalo, LLC; Strategic NYC, LLC; T Fin, LLC; BCF Capital, LLC; Strategic Consulting, LLC; Versara Lending, LLC; Anchor Client Services, LLC; Bedrock Client Services, LLC; Boulder Client Services, LLC; Canyon Client Services, LLC; Carolina Legal Services, LLC; Great Lakes Client Services, LLC; Guidestone Client Services, LLC; Harbor Client Services, LLC; Heartland Client Services, LLC; Monarch Client Services, LLC; Newport Client Services, LLC; Northstar Client Services, LLC; Option 1 Client Services, LLC; Pioneer Client Servicing, LLC; Rockwell Client Services, LLC; Royal Client Services, LLC; Stonepoint Client Services, LLC; Summit Client Services, LLC; Whitestone Client Services, LLC; Twist Financial, LLC; Duke Enterprises, LLC; and Blaise Investments, LLC (collectively, SFS); and as individuals: SFS Chief Executive Officer Ryan Sasson, Jason Blust, Daniel Blumkin, and Albert Ian Behar. The complaint also named the following relief defendants: Strategic ESOP; Strategic ESOT; The Blust Family Irrevocable Trust through Donald J. Holmgren, Trustee; Jaclyn Blust; Lit Def Strategies, LLC; and Relialit, LLC. SFS is a debt-relief company with offices in Buffalo and Manhattan, New York. In the First Amended Complaint filed on March 27, 2024, the Bureau alleges that since at least January 2016, SFS and the individual defendants have operated a debt-relief scheme that collects exorbitant, illegal advance fees from vulnerable consumers suffering financial difficulties through a web of interrelated companies they have created, including law firms, that serve as a facade for SFS\u2019s debt-relief operation. The Telemarketing Sales Rule (TSR) prohibits charging and collecting fees before renegotiating the terms of at least one debt and before a payment is made under the renegotiated terms, as well as charging fee amounts that are not tied to the percentage of the enrolled debt settled or reduced or the amount saved. The TSR also prohibits making a false or misleading statement to induce any person to pay for goods or services as well as misrepresenting any material aspects of debt relief services. The Bureau alleges that the defendants violated, and substantially assisted violations of, these prohibitions. Specifically, under SFS\u2019s direction, the web of companies induce consumers to sign up for debt-relief services using a bait and switch scheme that draws consumers in by offering a debt consolidation loan. Once consumers call SFS to inquire about the loan, SFS representatives push them towards purchasing debt relief services, which they misleadingly describe as the \u201c0% interest\u201d option. After making the sale, SFS begins debiting fees for the debt-relief services from consumers\u2019 escrow accounts long before any of the consumers\u2019 debts have been settled, and the fee amounts the companies collect are pre-determined and do not depend on any results the companies might obtain. As alleged in the complaint, since January 2016, defendants have collected at least $100,000,000 from consumers before any of the consumers\u2019 debts were settled, and in some instances when no such settlements ever took place. The complaint seeks permanent and preliminary injunctive relief, redress for consumers, and a civil money penalty. On January 11, 2024 and March 4, 2024, the court granted the Bureau\u2019s request for a temporary restraining order and preliminary injunction, respectively.",

The Bureau and DOJ allege that defendants violated the Equal Credit Opportunity Act (ECOA) by targeting consumers of Hispanic origin with a predatory loan product. The Bureau separately alleges that the Colony Ridge defendants violated the Consumer Financial Protection Act of 2010 (CFPA) by making deceptive representations to consumers; that Colony Ridge Development and Colony Ridge BV violated the Interstate Land Sales Full Disclosure Act (ILSA) by making untrue statements, omitting material facts, failing to provide required accurate translations, and failing to report and disclose required information; and that defendants violated the CFPA by virtue of their violations of ECOA and ILSA, respectively. DOJ further alleges defendants\u2019 conduct violated the Fair Housing Act. The joint complaint seeks, among other things, injunctions against defendants to prevent future violations of Federal consumer financial laws, redress to consumers, damages, and the imposition of civil money penalties.",

    "description": "On December 19, 2023, the Bureau issued an order against U.S. Bank in connection with its administration of prepaid debit cards that held unemployment insurance benefits. U.S. Bank has offered prepaid debit cards to eligible consumers in at least 19 states and the District of Columbia to distribute unemployment insurance benefits through its ReliaCard program. In the summer of 2020, U.S. Bank implemented new freeze criteria to determine whether to freeze a card due to suspected fraud. Using these new fraud controls and its expanded criteria used for freezing accounts, U.S. Bank froze the accounts of tens of thousands of cardholders eligible for benefits. The Bureau found that U.S. Bank engaged in unfair acts or practices in violation of the Consumer Financial Protection Act of 2010 by failing to provide those eligible ReliaCard prepaid debit cardholders whose accounts U.S. Bank froze with adequate means to verify their identities and timely regain access to their benefits. For freezes that U.S. Bank imposed in August 2020 through November 2020, on average it took a month or longer for consumers to unfreeze their ReliaCard accounts. And for freezes that U.S. Bank imposed in December 2020 through March 2021, on average it took multiple weeks for consumers to unfreeze their ReliaCard accounts. The Bureau also found that U.S. Bank violated the Electronic Fund Transfer Act, and its implementing Regulation E, by failing to timely investigate ReliaCard prepaid debit cardholders\u2019 notices of error concerning alleged unauthorized electronic fund transfers (EFTs). The order requires U.S. Bank to provide $5.7 million in redress to consumers and to pay a $15 million civil money penalty. The order also requires U.S. Bank to take measures to ensure future compliance. The OCC concurrently issued an order against U.S. Bank addressing U.S. Bank\u2019s conduct relating to administration of the ReliaCard program, separately fining it $15 million.",

The Bureau also found that Commonwealth violated the Fair Debt Collection Practices Act by sending debt collection letters to consumers before providing the consumer a verification of the debt when Commonwealth had received a written dispute from the consumer within 30 days of the consumer\u2019s receipt of a debt validation notice; misrepresenting to consumers that they owed alleged debts in certain circumstances when Commonwealth lacked a reasonable basis to make those representations; and communicating credit information about alleged debts to CRAs but failing to communicate that the debts were disputed. Among other injunctive relief, the order permanently bans Commonwealth from participating in or assisting others in any debt collection activities, debt buying, debt selling, and consumer reporting activities and requires Commonwealth to submit to all CRAs to whom it previously furnished information about any consumer a request to delete all collection accounts for such consumers.

    "description": "On December 7, 2023, the Bureau issued an order against Atlantic Union Bank, a regional bank headquartered in Richmond, Virginia. Under Regulation E, which implements the Electronic Fund Transfer Act, before a bank can charge overdraft fees on ATM or one-time debit card transactions, it must first obtain a consumer\u2019s affirmative consent (or opt-in) to the bank\u2019s payment of those transactions. The bank must also provide the consumer with a written notice describing the overdraft service before it can obtain that consumer\u2019s consent. The Bureau found that the bank violated Regulation E because, as part of its in-branch, checking account-opening process, its employees requested that new customers orally provide their enrollment decision before providing them with an adequate written notice describing the overdraft service. The Bureau also found that Atlantic Union Bank engaged in unlawful deception in violation of the Consumer Financial Protection Act of 2010 by misleading consumers who called in by phone and enrolled in its Opt-In Overdraft Privilege service; the bank misrepresented which transactions the service covered and omitted material information about the terms and conditions of the service. The Bank\u2019s actions with respect to consumers who called and opted in by phone also violated Regulation E. The Bureau\u2019s order requires Atlantic Union Bank to stop its unlawful conduct and to pay no less than $5 million in redress to affected consumers and a penalty of $1.2 million.",

The Home Mortgage Disclosure Act (HMDA) and its implementing regulation, Regulation C, require financial institutions to ask applicants for most mortgage loans for their race, ethnicity, and sex. The Bureau found that between 2016 and late 2020, at least hundreds of Bank of America\u2019s loan officers were not asking applicants for their race, ethnicity, and sex, as required by law, and instead falsely recorded that the applicants chose not to provide the information. The Bank\u2019s conduct violated HMDA, Regulation C, and the Consumer Financial Protection Act of 2010. The order requires Bank of America to pay a $12 million civil money penalty and to develop policies and procedures to ensure compliance with HMDA and Regulation C, including recording and auditing phone applications to make sure that HMDA data are accurately collected and recorded.",

    "description": "On November 20, 2023, the Bureau issued an order against Toyota Motor Credit Corporation (\u201cToyota Motor Credit\u201d), which is the United States-based auto-financing arm of Toyota Motor Corporation and one of the largest indirect auto lenders in the country. Toyota Motor Credit provides financing for vehicles and optional \u201cadd-on\u201d products and services sold with the vehicles. These add-ons include Guaranteed Asset Protection (GAP), which waives some of a consumer\u2019s remaining loan balance if their car is totaled but they still owe money on the loan even with car insurance, and Credit Life and Accidental Health (CLAH), which is designed to pay a remaining balance if the consumer dies or becomes disabled. The Bureau found that Toyota Motor Credit violated the Consumer Financial Protection Act of 2010 by: (1) unfairly and abusively making it unreasonably difficult for consumers to cancel unwanted add-ons, including when consumers complained that dealers had forced add-ons on consumers without their consent; (2) unfairly failing to ensure consumers received refunds of unearned GAP and CLAH premiums when they paid off their loans early or ended lease agreements early, making the products no longer of any value to consumers; and (3) unfairly failing to provide accurate refunds to consumers who canceled their vehicle service agreements as a result of flawed system logic. The Bureau also found that Toyota Motor Credit violated the Fair Credit Reporting Act and its implementing Regulation V by falsely reporting customer accounts as delinquent even though customers had already returned their vehicles and failing to promptly correct the negative information it had sent to consumer reporting agencies; and failing to maintain reasonable policies and procedures to ensure payment information it sent to consumer reporting agencies was accurate. The order requires Toyota Motor Credit to pay $48 million in consumer redress and a $12 million civil money penalty. The order also requires Toyota Motor Credit to stop its unlawful practices and come into compliance with the law and prohibits incentive-based employee compensation or performance measurements in relation to add-on products.",

    "description": "On November 15, 2023, the Bureau issued an order against Enova International, Inc., a publicly-traded online small-dollar lender, headquartered in Chicago, Illinois, that markets, provides, and services loans under the brand names CashNetUSA (CNU) and NetCredit. In 2019, the Bureauissued an orderagainst Enova based on the Bureau\u2019s finding that Enova violated the Consumer Financial Protection Act of 2010 (CFPA) by debiting consumers\u2019 bank accounts without authorization and failing to honor loan extensions it granted to consumers. The 2019 order, among other requirements, barred Enova from making or initiating electronic fund transfers without valid authorization and from failing to honor loan extensions. The Bureau found that Enova violated the 2019 Order, and therefore the CFPA, by debiting or attempting to debit consumers\u2019 bank accounts in a wide array of circumstances without the consumer\u2019s express informed consent; failing to honor loan extensions it had granted to consumers; debiting the full loan payment instead of a loan extension fee on loans for which Enova had granted a loan extension; and making or initiating electronic fund transfers from consumers\u2019 bank accounts on a recurring basis without valid authorization identifying the particular bank account the consumer had authorized for EFTs and providing a copy of that authorization to the consumer. The Bureau also found that Enova violated the CFPA\u2019s prohibition on unfair acts and practices by debiting or attempting to debit consumers\u2019 accounts without their authorization and by canceling previously-granted loan extensions and debiting such consumers\u2019 bank accounts for the full loan payment instead of a loan extension fee. The Bureau further found that Enova violated the CFPA\u2019s prohibition on deceptive acts or practices by failing to tell consumers who had been granted a loan extension that making an interim partial payment would result in cancellation of the loan extension, misrepresenting the amount that Enova would charge consumers who made such an interim partial payment, misrepresenting the due date for certain loan payments, misrepresenting that consumers could skip certain loan payments, and misrepresenting the amounts due on certain consumer loans. The order bans Enova from offering or providing certain types of loans, requires Enova to come into compliance with the law, and requires Enova to incorporate compliance into its executive compensation policies and agreements. The order requires Enova to provide redress to all consumers whose accounts it debited without their express informed consent and to pay a $15 million civil money penalty.",

The Bureau also found that Citibank failed to provide applicants with an accurate and adequate statement of the specific reasons for the adverse action when the applicant was denied based on their Armenian national origin in violation of ECOA and Regulation B. Citibank\u2019s violations of ECOA also constitute violations of the CFPA. The order requires Citibank to provide $1.4 million in redress to consumers and pay a $24.5 million civil money penalty.

    "description": "On October 12, 2023, the Bureau and the Federal Trade Commission filed a joint complaint and stipulated order against TransUnion Rental Screening Solutions, Inc., a Delaware corporation with its principal place of business in Greenwood Village, Colorado, and its parent company, Trans Union LLC, a Delaware company with its principal place of business in Chicago, Illinois (collectively, TransUnion Rental Screening). TransUnion Rental Screening is a consumer reporting agency that provides tenant and employment background screening reports to thousands of client rental property owners, property management companies, employers, and other background screening companies throughout the United States to assist users in selecting tenants and employees. The complaint alleged that TransUnion Rental Screening violated the Fair Credit Reporting Act by failing in numerous instances to (1) follow reasonable procedures to assure maximum possible accuracy of eviction records in its tenant screening reports; and (2) when it obtained criminal and eviction records from third-party vendors, identify the third-party vendor as a source of the records in its disclosures to consumers. As the complaint alleged, inaccurate and misleading information in tenant screening reports can significantly interfere with consumers\u2019 ability to find housing and cause them harm, including prolonged housing searches, additional application fees, time and money spent correcting errors, higher rental payments, temporary housing costs, and denial of housing. The stipulated order, which the court entered on October 18, 2023, requires that TransUnion Rental Screening take specific actions to ensure maximum possible accuracy of its tenant screening reports and provide complete disclosures to consumers who request them. It also requires TransUnion Rental Screening to pay $11 million in consumer redress and a $4 million penalty to the Bureau.",

(collectively, TransUnion), which are headquartered in Chicago, Illinois. Security freezes and locks block certain third parties, such as lenders, from accessing consumers\u2019 credit reports to prevent a potential identity thief from obtaining new credit in those consumers\u2019 names. Consumers can remove or lift security freezes upon request to, for example, apply for credit. Starting in September 2018, Federal law has required nationwide consumer reporting agencies to provide security freezes as a free service, whereas locks are a feature of certain paid products. The Bureau found that TransUnion, from as early as 2003, failed to timely place or remove security freezes and locks on the credit reports of tens of thousands of consumers who requested them, including certain vulnerable consumers; in some cases, those requests were left unmet for months or years. The Bureau found TransUnion\u2019s failure to place or remove security freezes in a timely manner occurred as a result of problems, including systems issues, that TransUnion knew about but failed to address for years. The Bureau found that TransUnion\u2019s failure to place or remove security freezes in a timely manner violated the Fair Credit Reporting Act (FCRA), and TransUnion\u2019s failure to place or remove both security freezes and locks in a timely manner was unfair in violation of the Consumer Financial Protection Act of 2010 (CFPA). Further, the Bureau found that TransUnion engaged in deceptive acts and practices by falsely telling certain consumers that their requests had been successful when they had not. In addition, the Bureau found that from about 2016 to 2020, TransUnion failed to exclude certain consumers, including active-duty military and other potential victims of identity theft, from pre-screened solicitation lists in violation of FCRA. The Bureau\u2019s order requires TransUnion to pay $3 million to consumers in redress and $5 million in civil penalties. TransUnion must also take steps to address and prevent unlawful conduct, including convening a committee to identify and solve technical and systems problems that can affect consumers.",

    "description": "On October 10, 2023, the Bureau filed a lawsuit against Freedom Mortgage Corporation (Freedom), a residential mortgage loan originator and servicer headquartered in Boca Raton, Florida. In 2020, Freedom reported Home Mortgage Disclosure Act (HMDA) data on over 700,000 loans and applications and originated nearly 400,000 HMDA-reportable loans, making it the third largest mortgage lender in the United States by origination volume. In 2019, the Bureau issued an order against Freedom finding that it intentionally misreported certain HMDA data fields from at least 2014 to 2017(2019 Order). The Bureau\u2019s 2023 complaint alleged that the mortgage loan data for 2020 that Freedom submitted pursuant to HMDA contained widespread errors across multiple data fields, in violation of HMDA and its implementing Regulation C. These alleged HMDA violations occurred while Freedom was under the 2019 Order. The Bureau\u2019s complaint further alleged that by reporting inaccurate mortgage loan data for 2020, Freedom also violated the 2019 Order and the Consumer Financial Protection Act of 2010 (CFPA). On June 26, 2024, the court entered a stipulated final judgment and order that imposes injunctive relief designed to prevent Freedom from violating the law in the future, including requirements to regularly audit, test, and correct the company\u2019s HMDA data. It also requires Freedom to pay a $3.95 million civil money penalty.",

    "description": "On September 11, 2023, the Bureau issued an order against Tempoe, LLC, a nonbank consumer finance company, with offices in Cincinnati, Ohio and Manchester, New Hampshire. Tempoe purchased personal property and services from retailers and then leased them to consumers. Typically, consumers were offered Tempoe\u2019s product after applying and being rejected for conventional financing through the retailer. Under the terms of Tempoe\u2019s agreements, consumers made periodic payments for an initial term of five months. Then, unless the consumer made an active selection to purchase or return the property, Tempoe continued auto-debiting the consumers for the full month-to-month term of the contract, typically 18 to 36 months. Some consumers discovered only at the conclusion of their initial term that they did not own their items and were required to pay more. The Bureau found that Tempoe engaged in unfair acts and practices in violation of the Consumer Financial Protection Act of 2010 by (1) failing to ensure that consumers had access to the terms of the transaction, and (2) prohibiting the return of some goods and services. The Bureau also found that Tempoe violated Regulation M, which implements the Consumer Leasing Act, by failing to provide consumers with required disclosures for leases that extended beyond the initial term by six months or more. The order permanently bans Tempoe from offering or providing consumer leases and requires Tempoe to release all consumers with existing lease agreements from their leases and to allow them to maintain the leased products with no further financial obligation; this includes approximately 19,300 leases with an aggregate value of approximately $33 million. The order also requires Tempoe to pay a $2 million civil money penalty, of which $1 million will be remitted upon Tempoe\u2019s payment of that amount to the states that filed a parallel multi-state settlement addressing the same conduct.",

Southern is a high-cost installment lender that operates over 250 brick-and-mortar storefronts located in the states of Texas, Oklahoma, Alabama, Georgia, Tennessee, and South Carolina under a variety of trade names, including Covington Credit, Southern Finance, Quick Credit, and Heights Finance. The Bureau alleges that Southern employs numerous harmful underwriting, sales, and servicing practices for their refinanced loans that are designed to churn delinquent borrowers into continuous fee-laden debt; these fee-laden refinances erode the borrowers\u2019 available credit and increase their total cost of borrowing with each successive refinance. The Bureau further alleges that Southern has generated hundreds of millions in loan costs and fees and that it derives 40% of its net revenue through this process of \u201cchurning\u201d borrowers in repeated, fee-laden refinances. The Bureau alleges that Southern\u2019s loan-churning practices violate the Consumer Financial Protection Act of 2010 because they are unfair; they are abusive because they take unreasonable advantage of borrowers\u2019 lack of understanding of the material risks, costs, or conditions of a refinanced Southern loan; and they are abusive because they take unreasonable advantage of payment-stressed borrowers\u2019 inability to protect their interests in the selection or use of a refinanced loan. The Bureau seeks redress for consumers, injunctive relief, and a civil money penalty.",

    "description": "On August 2, 2023, the Bureau filed a lawsuit against USASF Servicing, LLC, an auto-loan servicer headquartered in Lawrenceville, Georgia. USASF offered both Guaranteed Asset Protection (GAP) and collateral-protection insurance (CPI), which are products that consumers can buy when they buy or lease a car. GAP covers some of a consumer\u2019s loan balance if their car is totaled but they still owe money on the loan even with car insurance. CPI is physical-damage insurance that protects the lender if a consumer does not have auto insurance that covers the amount of their car loan. The Bureau alleges that USASF engaged in unfair acts and practices by: (1) wrongfully activating nearly 80,000 times starter-interruption devices, which are devices that warn consumers with beeps or disable their car altogether when they are late with a loan payment; (2) failing to ensure refunds of GAP premiums when consumers were entitled to a refund because they paid off their loan early or their car was repossessed by USASF, totaling millions of dollars for thousands of consumers; (3) erroneously billing 34,000 consumers for CPI by charging them twice each billing cycle, totaling around $1.9 million; (4) wrongfully applying extra consumer payments first to late fees or CPI instead of accrued interest; and (5) wrongfully repossessing consumers\u2019 cars dozens of times due to errors by USASF or its vendor. The Bureau seeks, among other things, redress to consumers, civil money penalties, and injunctions to prevent future violations.",

    "description": "On July 19, 2023, the Bureau filed a lawsuit against Snap Finance LLC, Snap RTO LLC, Snap Second Look LLC, Snap U.S. Holdings LLC, and Snap Finance Holdings LLC (collectively, Snap), a group of interrelated companies headquartered in West Valley, Utah. Snap offers and provides so-called \u201clease-purchase\u201d or \u201crental-purchase\u201d financing, through which consumers finance merchandise and services from merchants and, in turn, make payments back to Snap.

The Bureau alleges that, during this period, Snap designed and implemented its financing program in ways that misled these consumers through the advertising, servicing, and collections of its agreements, failed to provide consumers with required disclosures, and interfered with consumers\u2019 ability to understand the terms and conditions of their agreements. The Bureau alleges that such conduct violated the Consumer Financial Protection Act of 2010\u2019s prohibition of deceptive and abusive acts and practices and the Truth in Lending Act and its implementing Regulation Z. The Bureau further alleges that Snap violated the Electronic Fund Transfer Act and its implementing Regulation E by unlawfully conditioning the extension of credit on consumers\u2019 repayment through preauthorized ACH debits, and the Fair Credit Reporting Act and its implementing Regulation V by failing to establish and implement reasonable written policies and procedures concerning the accuracy and integrity of consumer information that it furnished.

    "description": "On July 13, 2023, the Bureau and several state partners filed a complaint in an adversary proceeding against Prehired, LLC, Prehired Recruiting, LLC, and Prehired Accelerator, LLC. Prehired has its principal place of business in Delaware and, prior to filing bankruptcy, operated a private, for-profit vocational training program for software sales representatives. Prehired charged up to $30,000 for its program and encouraged consumers who could not pay upfront to enter into income share loans. Prehired\u2019s income share loans required consumers to make minimum payments equal to between 12.5% and 16% of their gross income for 4 to 8 years or until they had paid a total of $30,000, whichever was sooner. Prehired transferred ownership of many of these loans to other entities, including Prehired Recruiting and Prehired Accelerator. The complaint alleged that Prehired deceptively represented that its income share loans were not loans; deceptively represented that consumers would pay nothing until they had a job making at least $60,000 a year; and failed to disclose key financing terms required by the Truth in Lending Act (TILA) and Regulation Z. The complaint also alleged that Prehired Recruiting engaged in unfair acts and practices by filing debt collection lawsuits in a distant forum when consumers neither lived in that forum nor were in that forum when they executed the financing agreement. The complaint further alleged that Prehired Recruiting and Prehired Accelerator violated the Fair Debt Collection Practices Act (FDCPA) and the Consumer Financial Protection Act of 2010 (CFPA) by deceptively inducing consumers to enter into settlement agreements, and the FDCPA by claiming the consumers owed more than they did. The attorneys general from Washington, Oregon, Delaware, Minnesota, Illinois, Wisconsin, Massachusetts, North Carolina, South Carolina, and Virginia, and California\u2019s Department of Financial Protection and Innovation joined the action. The Court signed the stipulated judgment and it became final on November 20, 2023. The stipulated judgment requires Prehired to pay consumer redress and prejudgment interest totaling $4,248,249.30 and a $1 civil money penalty. It also requires defendants to cease doing business and prohibits them from participating or assisting others in advertising, selling, or assisting in providing any consumer financial product or services relating to vocational education services. The stipulated judgment also voids, and prohibits defendants from collecting on, Prehired\u2019s income share loans or other consumer agreements that financed vocational education services.",

    "description": "On July 11, 2023, the Bureau issued an order against Bank of America, N.A., which is a national bank headquartered in Charlotte, North Carolina with branches and ATMs located in 38 states and the District of Columbia. When a consumer writes a check or authorizes an ACH transaction to a merchant or other payee using their deposit account at Bank of America, the merchant or other payee may then present that check or ACH authorization to the bank for payment. Until February 2022, if a consumer did not have sufficient funds in their account to pay for the transaction and the bank decided not to pay it, Bank of America assessed the consumer a $35 non-sufficient funds fee. Merchants commonly \u201cre-present\u201d these returned transactions\u2014that is, they again try to receive payment\u2014often multiple times. For many years, Bank of America assessed non-sufficient fund fees on ACH and check transactions that it returned unpaid even though it had already assessed a $35 fee for the same ACH or check transaction that it had previously returned unpaid (i.e., repeat non-sufficient fund fees). Bank of America would assess these repeat non-sufficient fund fees potentially as soon as the next day after the initial transaction. From September 2018 until February 2022, Bank of America generated hundreds of millions of dollars in such fees. The Bureau found that Bank of America\u2019s assessment of repeat non-sufficient fund fees was unfair in violation of the Consumer Financial Protection Act of 2010. The Bureau\u2019s order requires Bank of America to refund all repeat non-sufficient fund fees that it collected since September 2018 and has not yet refunded, totaling approximately $80.4 million in redress. The bank must also pay a $60 million civil penalty to the Bureau. The Office of the Comptroller of the Currency (OCC) concurrently issued an order against the Bank separately fining it $60 million.",

    "description": "On May 31, 2023, the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau (Bureau) issued an order against OneMain Financial Holdings, LLC; OneMain Financial Group, LLC; OneMain Financial (HI), Inc.; OneMain Financial, Inc.; and OneMain Financial of Minnesota, Inc. (collectively referred to as OneMain). OneMain is an Indiana-based personal loan installment lender with more than 1,400 branches across 44 states. In connection with loan originations and renewals, OneMain markets, sells, and finances add-on products, including credit life insurance, credit disability insurance, and identity theft protection. For several years, OneMain misrepresented to tens of thousands of consumers who purchased and then subsequently canceled optional add-on products that they could cancel the products during what it called a \u201cfull refund period\u201d and be returned to the financial position they would have been in had the product never been added to their loan. The Bureau found that OneMain engaged in deceptive acts or practices in violation of the Consumer Financial Protection Act of 2010 (CFPA) by misleading consumers into believing they must purchase add-on products to receive loans and that they could cancel the add-on products within a prescribed time period without cost. The Bureau also found that OneMain engaged in unfair acts or practices in violation of the CFPA by charging and failing to refund the full premium and interest that accrued on add-on products consumers did not agree to purchase and by charging and failing to refund interest that accrued on add-on product fees during a purported full-refund period. Finally, the Bureau found that OneMain violated the CFPA by abusively interfering with consumers\u2019 ability to understand that add-on products were optional and that OneMain charged non-refundable interest during the purported full-refund period. The order requires OneMain to stop its unlawful activities, adjust its policies to make cancellation of add-on products easier, include interest in refunds after add-on product cancellations, pay at least $10,000,000 in consumer redress, and pay a $10,000,000 civil money penalty. OneMain must also take measures to ensure future compliance.",

Carnes, both individually and in their roles as co-trustees of two trusts, as a result of James Carnes\u2019s efforts to conceal assets and avoid paying a judgment of more than $43 million to the Bureau. The Bureau obtained the judgment after finding that Carnes and his company, Integrity Advance, LLC, violated multiple laws, including the Consumer Financial Protection Act of 2010, and caused significant harm to consumers.SeeCFPB v. Integrity Advance, LLC and James R. Carnes, 2015-CFPB-0029 (administrative proceeding);Consumer Financial Protection Bureau v. Integrity Advance, LLC and James R. Carnes, 2:21-mc-206 (D. Kan. July 30, 2021) (judgment).The Bureau\u2019s complaint alleged that James Carnes engaged in multiple fraudulent transactions in violation of the Federal Debt Collection Procedures Act to remove assets and conceal them from the Bureau. Specifically, the complaint alleged that soon after Carnes became aware of the Bureau\u2019s investigation into his illegal payday lending business, he began transferring significant assets to his wife\u2019s trust and that, in total, he transferred more than $12 million to the trust during the Bureau\u2019s investigation and subsequent administrative proceeding. On July 17, 2023, the court issued prejudgment writs of garnishment and attachment freezing assets that had been transferred to the trust, and on November 9, 2023, the court denied Melissa Carnes\u2019 motion to quash those writs. On June 25, 2024, the court entered a stipulated final judgment and order that imposes a $12 million judgment on James and Melissa Carnes. Full payment of this amount is suspended based on a demonstrated inability to pay following, among other things, the Carnes\u2019 payment of $7 million to the Bureau, which will be applied to James Carnes\u2019 $43 million judgment.",

    "description": "On March 23, 2023, the Bureau filed a complaint and proposed stipulated final judgment and order to resolve the Bureau\u2019s claims against Portfolio Recovery Associates, LLC, one of the largest debt collectors in the United States. The court entered the order on April 13, 2023. On September 9, 2015, the Bureau issued an order against Portfolio Recovery Associates (2015 Order) to address the Bureau\u2019s findings that Portfolio Recovery Associates violated the Consumer Financial Protection Act of 2010 (CFPA) and the Fair Debt Collection Practices Act (FDCPA) in connection with Portfolio Recovery Associates\u2019 debt collection practices. The Bureau alleged that Portfolio Recovery Associates violated the 2015 Order, the CFPA, the FDCPA, and the Fair Credit Reporting Act (FCRA) and its implementing Regulation V. Specifically, the Bureau alleged that Portfolio Recovery Associates violated the CFPA and, in some instances, the FDCPA, when it violated multiple conduct provisions from the 2015 Order, including prohibitions on (1) representing the amount or validity of unsubstantiated debt; (2) collecting on debt without offering to provide necessary documentation to consumers; (3) mispresenting that it would provide the offered documents within thirty days; (4) collecting on time-barred debt without making required disclosures; (5) initiating debt collection lawsuits without possessing required documentation; and (6) suing to collect time-barred debt. The Bureau also alleged that several of Portfolio Recovery Associates\u2019 practices for resolving disputes about information it furnished to consumer reporting agencies (CRAs) violated FCRA, Regulation V, and the CFPA. Specifically, the Bureau claimed that Portfolio Recovery Associates failed to (1) timely resolve disputes submitted by consumers directly to Portfolio Recovery Associates ; (2) properly respond to disputes that Portfolio Recovery Associates deemed frivolous; (3) conduct reasonable investigations of consumer\u2019s disputes; and (4) maintain reasonable policies and procedures regarding the accuracy and integrity of consumer information that it furnished to CRAs. The Bureau alleged that Portfolio Recovery Associates illegally collected millions of dollars through its unlawful conduct, and that its illegal dispute resolution practices impacted at least tens of thousands of consumers. The order requires Portfolio Recovery Associates to pay at least $12.18 million in redress to harmed consumers and a $12 million civil money penalty. It also imposes broad injunctive relief designed to prevent Portfolio Recovery Associates from violating the law in the future.",

    "description": "On February 27, 2023, the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau (Bureau) issued an order against RMK Financial Corp. (RMK), a California-based mortgage lender that also does business under the name Majestic Home Loans. RMK, which is licensed as a mortgage broker or lender in at least 30 states, originates consumer mortgages, including mortgages guaranteed by the Department of Veterans Affairs (VA) and mortgages insured by the Federal Housing Administration (FHA). The Bureau previously issued an order against RMK on April 8, 2015 (2015 Order). The Bureau\u2019s 2015 Order was based on the Bureau\u2019s finding that RMK disseminated numerous advertisements for mortgages that contained deceptive representations in violation of the Consumer Financial Protection Act of 2010 (CFPA) and the Mortgage Acts and Practices\u2014Advertising Rule (Regulation N) or failed to include required disclosures in violation of the Truth in Lending Act (TILA) and its implementing regulation, Regulation Z. These included advertisements that RMK sent to U.S. military servicemembers and veterans that used the names and logos of the VA and FHA in a way that falsely implied that the advertisements were sent by the VA or FHA and advertisements that misrepresented the loan\u2019s terms. The 2015 Order required RMK to abide by a series of prohibitions against the types of misrepresentations and other violations the Bureau found in the 2015 Order. The Bureau found that, after the 2015 Consent Order went into effect, RMK disseminated millions of mortgage advertisements that made deceptive representations or contained inadequate or impermissible disclosures in violation of the 2015 Order, as well as the CFPA, Regulation N, and Regulation Z. These included, for example, advertisements that misrepresented that RMK was the VA or the FHA or that RMK was affiliated with the VA or the FHA, advertisements that misrepresented they were sent by the VA or FHA, advertisements that misrepresented that benefits available to those who qualified for VA or FHA loans were time limited, and advertisements that misrepresented the amount of the monthly payments for the advertised loan. Many of these advertisements reflected the same types of deceptive and other unlawful advertising practices that were the subject of the Bureau\u2019s findings in the 2015 Order and expressly prohibited by the 2015 Order. This order permanently bans RMK from the mortgage lending business by permanently prohibiting RMK from engaging in any mortgage lending activities, including advertising, marketing, promoting, offering, providing, originating, administering, servicing, or selling mortgage loans, or otherwise participating in or receiving remuneration from mortgage lending, or assisting others in doing so. The order also requires RMK to pay a $1 million civil money penalty.",

The Military Lending Act (MLA) contains a number of protections for active-duty servicemembers, their spouses, children, and other dependents, defined as \u201ccovered borrowers.\u201d Among other protections, the MLA prohibits nonbank creditors from using vehicle titles to secure loans to covered borrowers. The Bureau found that TitleMax violated the MLA by extending thousands of title loans to covered borrowers; extending loans that exceeded the MLA\u2019s 36% Military Annual Percentage Rate (MAPR) cap; failing to make disclosures required under the MLA; extending loans to covered borrowers with MLA-prohibited arbitration clauses; and extending loans to covered borrowers with onerous notice requirements. The Bureau also found that TitleMax engaged in unfair acts or practices in violation of the Consumer Financial Protection Act of 2010 (CFPA) by charging borrowers for an insurance product that provided no coverage on about 15,000 loans. The Bureau further found that in doing so, TitleMax understated the finance charges and annual percentage rates of those loans, violating the Truth in Lending Act and CFPA. The order requires TitleMax to stop its unlawful activities, pay $5,050,000 in consumer redress, and pay a $10,000,000 penalty.",

Credit Acceptance is one of the country\u2019s largest publicly traded auto lenders, doing business with a network of more than 12,000 affiliated used-car dealers. The joint complaint alleges that Credit Acceptance pushes dealers to sell cars with hidden interest costs and surreptitiously include expensive add-on products with vehicle sales. The complaint further alleges that Credit Acceptance applies complicated algorithms to predict how much it is likely to collect from borrowers to determine how much to offer dealers for each loan, resulting in high-cost loans\u2014with annual percentage rates (APR) often exceeding state usury caps\u2014made without regard for borrowers\u2019 ability to repay, while still yielding profits for Credit Acceptance. A significant number of Credit Acceptance\u2019s most credit-constrained borrowers become delinquent on their loans within the first year, and many also lose their cars to repossession and auction or suffer other negative effects from the loans. The joint complaint alleges that Credit Acceptance is engaging in deceptive acts or practices in violation of the Consumer Financial Protection Act of 2010 by misrepresenting key loan terms, including the true principal, finance charge, and APR. The joint complaint further alleges that Credit Acceptance is engaging in abusive acts or practices by taking unreasonable advantage of consumers\u2019 lack of understanding of the risk of default and the severity of the consequences associated with its loans, and taking unreasonable advantage of consumers\u2019 inability to protect their interests in selecting or using Credit Acceptance\u2019s loans. The joint complaint also alleges that Credit Acceptance substantially assists dealers in the deceptive sale of add-on products. The complaint seeks permanent injunctive relief, damages, and civil money penalties.",

The Bureau identified multiple violations across several of the bank\u2019s largest consumer product lines, which led to billions of dollars in financial harm and, in thousands of cases, the loss of customers\u2019 vehicles and homes. Specifically, with respect to auto loan servicing Wells Fargo engaged in unfair acts and practices in violation of the Consumer Financial Protection Act of 2010 by incorrectly applying consumer payments; charging borrowers incorrect fees, interest, or other amounts; wrongly repossessing borrowers\u2019 vehicles; and failing to refund consumers who had paid certain fees upfront to automobile dealers when warranted. Wells Fargo also engaged in unfair practices by improperly denying mortgage loan modifications, miscalculating fees and other charges, and assessing unwarranted charges and fees. With respect to deposit accounts, Wells Fargo: unfairly froze multiple consumer accounts in instances of suspected fraud when lesser restraints were available; made deceptive claims as to the availability of waivers of monthly service fees; and unfairly charged overdraft fees even if the consumer had enough funds available in their account to cover the amount of the transaction at the time they made it. The order requires Wells Fargo to come into compliance with federal consumer financial law, pay more than $2 billion in consumer redress, and to pay a $1.7 billion penalty.",

    "description": "On November 17, 2022, the Bureau issued an order against Carrington Mortgage Services, LLC, a California-based mortgage servicer operating in all fifty states. Carrington services a large number of federally backed mortgage loans, which are made or guaranteed by federal agencies or government-sponsored entities (GSEs). In 2020, Congress passed the CARES Act, which provided borrowers with federally backed mortgage loans who were experiencing financial hardship during the COVID-19 emergency with certain assistance, including forbearances of up to 180-days each upon request and protections for credit reporting. The federal agencies and GSEs also issued guidelines to their servicers relating to assistance to borrowers during the pandemic. The Bureau found that Carrington failed to implement a number of those protections through misrepresentations to consumers, including by: representing that borrowers could not have 180 days of forbearance on request or that certain borrowers could not have forbearance at all; representing that consumers had to make more detailed attestations than were actually required by law; representing that late fees for amounts in forbearance would be charged when they were not permitted; and providing incorrect or confusing information about forbearance and repayment options. The Bureau also found that Carrington did not accurately report the status of borrowers on forbearance to consumer reporting agencies (CRAs), and failed to maintain and update its written policies and procedures relating to furnishing to CRAs in connection with the CARES Act. As a result, the Bureau determined that Carrington violated the Consumer Financial Protection Act of 2010\u2019s (CFPA) prohibition on deceptive conduct, as well as certain provisions of the Fair Credit Reporting Act (FCRA) and its implementing regulation, Regulation V. The order requires Carrington to, among other things, conduct an audit to ensure any improperly charged late fees have been refunded to consumers, and if not, to refund them; to assess customer service staffing and provide training relating to applicable CARES Act and agency and GSE guidelines; to establish policies and procedures to prevent the issues from recurring; and to pay a civil money penalty of $5.25 million.",

ACTIVE provides enrollment and payment processing services to organizers of charity races, youth camps, and other events. The Bureau alleges that ACTIVE engaged in deceptive and abusive acts and practices in violation of the Consumer Financial Protection Act of 2010 (CFPA) by enrolling consumers in and charging them for discount club memberships without their knowledge, consent, or a full understanding of the material terms of the transaction. ACTIVE does this by inserting a webpage into the online event registration and payment process that provides an offer for a free trial enrollment in a discount club membership called \u201cActive Advantage.\u201d Many consumers click on the highlighted call to action button\u2014which is typically labeled \u201cAccept\u201d\u2014because they believe that by doing so, they are accepting charges to participate in an event. Instead, consumers are enrolling in a trial membership in Active Advantage, which automatically converts to a paid subscription with an annual fee, unless consumers opt out by canceling their membership within 30 days.

    "description": "On October 4, 2022, the Bureau issued an order against Choice Money Transfer, Inc., which does business as Small World Money Transfer (Choice Money). Choice Money is a nonbank remittance transfer provider incorporated in New York and headquartered in New Jersey which offers remittances in at least 27 states and the District of Columbia. It provides remittances to over 90 countries worldwide through a nationwide network of over 2,000 agents and handles more than 500,000 transactions each month. The Bureau found that since the 2013 effective date of the Remittance Transfer Rule, Choice Money engaged in practices that violated numerous provisions of the Electronic Fund Transfer Act (EFTA) and its implementing Regulation E, including Subpart B, known as the Remittance Transfer Rule. Specifically, the Bureau found that Choice Money failed to comply with a wide range of disclosure requirements set out in EFTA and the Remittance Transfer Rule. Choice Money failed to disclose accurately certain required information, including when funds would be available to recipients, exchange rates, and transfer fees. Its disclosures also failed to use proper terms, to adequately disclose other key terms, to clearly and conspicuously disclose the exchange rate, and to provide disclosures in both English and Spanish as required by the Remittance Transfer Rule. Choice Money also failed to refund fees after senders properly submitted error resolution requests; failed to obtain consumer consent prior to providing receipts in electronic form on its mobile application and website platforms; failed to develop and maintain required policies and procedures for error resolution and to retain evidence demonstrating that it complied with error resolution requirements; and included in its disclosures an improper waiver of consumer rights under EFTA. These violations also constituted violations of the Consumer Financial Protection Act of 2010. The consent order requires Choice Money to come into compliance and to pay a civil money penalty of $950,000.",

    "description": "On September 29, 2022, the Bureau filed a lawsuit against MoneyLion Technologies Inc. (MoneyLion), ML Plus, LLC, and 37 MoneyLion lending subsidiaries. The Bureau filed a first amended complaint on June 13, 2023. MoneyLion is a fintech company (formerly known as MoneyLion Inc.) that offers online installment loans and other products to consumers through its lending subsidiaries and membership programs through its subsidiary ML Plus. The Military Lending Act (MLA) contains a number of protections for active-duty servicemembers and their dependents, defined as \u201ccovered borrowers.\u201d The Bureau alleges that MoneyLion and its lending subsidiaries violated the MLA by: imposing membership fees on covered borrowers that, when combined with loan-interest-rate charges, exceeded the MLA\u2019s annual percentage rate cap; inserting illegal arbitration provisions into contracts; requiring covered borrowers to submit to arbitration or in the case of a dispute, to reject the arbitration provision within thirty days of the date of the contract; demanding that borrowers provide written notice rejecting the arbitration provision within thirty days of the date of the contract as a condition for legal action; and failing to make required disclosures to covered borrowers. The Bureau also alleges that MoneyLion, its lending subsidiaries, and ML Plus engaged in deceptive acts or practices in violation of the Consumer Financial Protection Act of 2010 by misrepresenting that covered borrowers owed loan payments and associated fees that they did not in fact owe because loan contracts were void from their inception. The Bureau further alleges that MoneyLion and ML Plus engaged in unfair, deceptive, and abusive acts and practices by: not permitting consumers with unpaid loan balances to exit the membership program and stop monthly membership-fee charges; misrepresenting consumers\u2019 right to cancel their memberships for any reason and not clearly disclosing these restrictions on membership cancellation when consumers took out loans; and continuing to charge and collect monthly membership fees after consumers had asked to cancel their memberships or terminate ACH-fee withdrawals. The Bureau seeks redress for consumers, injunctive relief, and a civil money penalty.",

    "description": "On September 28, 2022, the Bureau issued an order against Regions Bank, a bank headquartered in Birmingham, Alabama with consolidated assets over $163 billion. Previously, in 2015, the BureauorderedRegions to cease certain unlawful conduct related to its charging overdraft fees to resolve the Bureau\u2019s findings that Regions: (1) violated the law when it failed to obtain consent for overdraft fees from customers with linked savings accounts; and (2) deceived customers by charging them overdraft fees in connection with repaying deposit advances despite the bank\u2019s representations that it would not charge such fees. In this case, the Bureau found that, from August 2018 through July 2021, Regions charged overdraft fees on debit-card purchases and ATM withdrawals even though consumers had sufficient funds when they made the transaction ( \u201cAuthorized-Positive Overdraft Fees\u201d). There is a delay between the time a customer made a purchase with a debit card and when Regions pays the merchant from the customer\u2019s account for the purchase. When a customer had sufficient funds in their account to make a debit-card purchase, Regions authorized the transaction and indicated that it was \u201cholding\u201d those funds aside. And yet, until July 2021, when it came time for Regions to pay the merchant for the initial purchase, Regions charged an overdraft fee on that purchase if the account\u2019s available funds were insufficient to cover the purchase at that time. Regions assessed these fees as a result of counter-intuitive, complex practices that it knew customers did not understand. The Bureau found that Regions acted unfairly and abusively in violation of the Consumer Financial Protection Act of 2010 when it charged these Authorized-Positive Overdraft Fees fees. The Bureau also found that Regions could have discontinued the fee years ago but chose to wait while it pursued changes that would generate new overdraft fees to make up for the lost revenue from the illegal fee. The order prohibits Regions from charging Authorized-Positive Overdraft Fees and requires it to refund at least $141 million in unlawful overdraft fees and pay a $50 million civil money penalty.",

When consumers sign up for the service, Hello Digit uses a proprietary algorithm to make automatic transfers from the consumer\u2019s checking account, called \u201cauto-saves,\u201d to an account held in Hello Digit\u2019s name. Hello Digit represented that the tool \u201cnever transfers more than you can afford,\u201d provided a \u201cno overdraft guarantee,\u201d and represented that, in the unlikely event of an overdraft, Hello Digit would reimburse consumers. The Bureau found that Hello Digit engaged in deceptive acts or practices because, in fact, Hello Digit\u2019s automated-savings tool routinely caused consumers\u2019 checking accounts to overdraft and Hello Digit did not always reimburse consumers for overdraft fees caused by the auto-save tool. The Bureau also found that as early as mid-2017, Hello Digit deceived consumers when it represented that it would not keep any interest earned on consumer funds that it was holding, when in fact Hello Digit kept a significant amount of the interest earned. The order enjoins Hello Digit from making any misrepresentations related to its auto-save tool and requires that Hello Digit provide at least $68,145 in redress to all consumers who were denied reimbursement requests for overdraft fees caused by Hello Digit\u2019s auto-save tool. Hello Digit must also pay a $2.7 million penalty.",

The Bureau also found that the bank\u2019s opening of accounts without consumers\u2019 permission was abusive in violation of the Consumer Financial Protection Act of 2010. The Bureau further found that U.S. Bank violated the Fair Credit Reporting Act by using or obtaining consumer reports without a permissible purpose in connection with unauthorized applications for credit cards. The bank\u2019s conduct likely caused substantial injury in the form of fees; negative effects on consumer-credit profiles; the loss of control over personal identifying information; and the expenditure of consumer time and effort.

The court entered the order on September 14, 2022. Trident is incorporated in Delaware and had locations in Delaware, New Jersey, and Pennsylvania at the time of the alleged conduct. Before the complaint was filed, Trident ceased originating mortgages. The states of Delaware, New Jersey, and Pennsylvania entered into concurrent agreements with Trident. The Bureau\u2019s and DOJ\u2019s joint complaint alleged that Trident engaged in unlawful discrimination on the basis of race, color, or national origin against applicants and prospective applicants, including by redlining majority-minority neighborhoods in the Philadelphia-Camden-Wilmington, PA-NJ-DE-MD Metropolitan Statistical Area (Philadelphia MSA) and engaged in acts and practices directed at prospective applicants that would discourage prospective applicants from applying for credit in violation of the Equal Credit Opportunity Act (ECOA), Regulation B, and the Consumer Financial Protection Act of 2010 (CFPA). DOJ also alleged that Trident\u2019s conduct violated the Fair Housing Act (FHA). The order requires Trident to invest $18.4 million in a loan subsidy program under which Trident will contract with a lender to increase the credit extended in majority-minority neighborhoods in the Philadelphia MSA and make the loans under the loan subsidy fund. That lender must also maintain at least four licensed branch locations in majority-minority neighborhoods in the Philadelphia MSA. Trident must also fund targeted advertising to generate applications for credit from qualified consumers in majority-minority neighborhoods in the Philadelphia MSA and take other remedial steps to serve the credit needs of majority-minority neighborhoods in the Philadelphia MSA. Trident must also pay a civil money penalty of $4 million.",

    "description": "On July 26, 2022, the Bureau issued a consent order against Hyundai Capital America (Hyundai), a nonbank automotive finance company based in Irvine, California. Hyundai purchases and services retail installment contracts and vehicle leases originated by Hyundai, Kia, and Genesis dealerships. Hyundai furnishes credit information on the auto loans it services by sending monthly data files to consumer reporting companies. The Bureau found that over several years Hyundai repeatedly furnished to consumer reporting companies information containing numerous systemic errors and that it knew of many of these inaccuracies for years before attempting to fix them. When Hyundai furnished inaccurate negative consumer information, it may have negatively affected consumers\u2019 access to credit. The Bureau found that Hyundai violated the Fair Credit Reporting Act (FCRA) and Regulation V by failing to promptly update and correct information it furnished to consumer reporting companies that it determined was not complete or accurate, and continuing to furnish this inaccurate and incomplete information; failing to provide the FCRA-required date of first delinquency on certain delinquent or charged-off accounts; failing to modify or delete information disputed by consumers that it found to be inaccurate; failing to establish reasonable identity theft and related blocking procedures to respond to identity theft notifications from consumer reporting companies such that Hyundai continued to report such information that should have been blocked on a consumer\u2019s report; and failing to establish and implement reasonable written policies and procedures regarding the accuracy and integrity of information provided to consumer reporting companies. These FCRA violations also constituted violations of the Consumer Financial Protection Act of 2010 (CFPA). The Bureau also concluded that Hyundai\u2019s use of ineffective manual processes and systems to furnish consumer information was unfair in violation of the CFPA. The consent order requires Hyundai to take steps to prevent future violations and to pay $13,200,000 in redress to affected consumers and a $6,000,000 civil money penalty.",

    "description": "On July 14, 2022, the Bureau issued an order against Bank of America, N.A., which is a national bank headquartered in Charlotte, North Carolina with branches and ATMs located in 38 states and the District of Columbia. Since 2020, Bank of America had contracts with 12 states, including California, to deliver unemployment insurance and other government benefit payments to consumers through prepaid debit cards. The onset of the COVID-19 pandemic in March 2020 led to a surge in consumers seeking unemployment insurance benefits. In the fall of 2020, and continuing through mid-2021, Bank of America changed its practices for investigating prepaid debit cardholder notices of error to solely rely on an automated fraud filter, which it knew or should have known would incorrectly determine that no error had occurred and which led to its incorrectly freezing or blocking accounts. The Bureau found that Bank of America engaged in unfair acts or practices by denying prepaid debit cardholders\u2019 notices of error and freezing their prepaid debit card accounts based solely on the results of the Bank\u2019s flawed fraud filter. The Bank also engaged in abusive acts or practices by retroactively applying its fraud filter to deny notices of error submitted by prepaid debit cardholders that it had previously investigated and paid. Further, Bank of America engaged in unfair acts and practices by impeding unemployment insurance benefit prepaid debit cardholders\u2019 efforts to file notices of error concerning their prepaid debit card accounts. The Bank\u2019s failure to conduct a reasonable investigation of prepaid debit cardholders\u2019 notices of error and failure to timely investigate and resolve prepaid debit cardholders\u2019 error claims also violated the Electronic Fund Transfer Act and its implementing Regulation E. The Bureau\u2019s order requires Bank of America to redress harmed consumers who suffered hundreds of millions of dollars in direct and consequential financial harm; harmed consumers will also be eligible to receive additional remediation through an individualized review process. The Bank must also review and reform its unemployment insurance benefit prepaid debit card program and pay a $100 million civil penalty to the Bureau. The OCC concurrently issued an order against the Bank separately fining it $125 million.",

    "description": "On July 12, 2022, the Bureau filed a lawsuit in the U.S. District Court for the Northern District of Texas against Populus Financial Group, Inc., which does business as ACE Cash Express, Inc. (\u201cACE\u201d). ACE is a payday lender headquartered in Irving, Texas and has approximately 979 stores in 22 states and the District of Columbia. The Bureau had previously found that ACE abusively induced borrowers with a demonstrated inability to repay their existing loan to take out a new ACE loan with accompanying fees, andon July 10, 2014, the Bureau ordered ACEto cease encouraging or suggesting that a delinquent borrower pay off their loan and then take out a new loan. ACE\u2019s loans come with a fee that is equivalent to a triple-digit interest rate, and consumers who cannot afford to pay back the loan and this fee often refinance their loans, incurring another fee to extend their loan for 14 or 30 days. Consumers in ten states, however, had the contractual right to one free repayment plan per year, which is designed to help consumers get out of a debt trap. Under the free repayment plan, consumers would owe their outstanding balance in four equal installments over their next four paydays, rather than owing one lump sum, without paying any additional fees or interest. The Bureau alleges that ACE engaged in unfair, abusive, and deceptive acts or practices in violation of the Consumer Financial Protection Act of 2010 (\u201cCFPA\u201d) by concealing this free repayment plan from consumers who were entitled to it, instead inducing them to refinance their loans for additional fees. As alleged in the complaint, since July 10, 2014, hundreds of thousands of consumers have paid ACE over $240 million in reborrowing fees while eligible for a free repayment plan. The Bureau also alleges that when ACE attempted to collect payment on its payday and title loans ACE unfairly made electronic withdrawals of consumers\u2019 money without their authorization. The Bureau seeks permanent injunctive relief, redress for consumers, and civil money penalties.",

The Bureau found that the respondents (1) substantially assisted student loan and traditional debt relief service providers in requesting or accepting advance fees for debt relief services in violation of the Telemarketing Sales Rule (TSR); (2) engaged in deceptive acts or practices in violation of the Consumer Financial Protection Act of 2010 (CFPA), including by misrepresenting itself as an independent third party and misrepresenting the companies\u2019 actions before disbursing fees to student loan debt relief service providers; and (3) engaged in unfair acts or practices in violation of the CFPA by disbursing unearned fees for student-loan debt relief services after consumers had unenrolled from or canceled the services. The order requires respondents to pay $8,676,180 in redress to consumers, which reflects the amount of unrefunded fees charged by AMS or RAM Payment and, for consumers enrolled in student loan debt relief services financed by a company affiliated with the companies, any unrefunded consumer fee payments for student loan debt relief services that AMS or RAM Payment disbursed to the affiliated company. The order also bans AMS, Winters, and Chaya from the debt relief payment processing and account maintenance industry, and, among other things, RAM Payment must (1) stop providing services to both student loan debt relief service providers and debt relief service providers receiving funding from or owned by an affiliated company; (2) stop paying commission to third-party marketing companies for consumer referrals; and (3) consent to the Bureau\u2019s supervisory authority. Respondents also must pay a $3 million civil money penalty.",

    "description": "On May 4, 2022, the Bureau issued a consent order against Bank of America, N.A., an insured depository institution, to address Bank of America\u2019s processing of garnishment notices. A garnishment notice is a notice issued by a court or judgment creditor directing a financial institution to freeze and then turn over a consumer\u2019s funds to pay off a court-ordered debt. The Bureau found that Bank of America engaged in unfair and deceptive acts and practices in violation of the Consumer Financial Protection Act of 2010. Specifically, Bank of America unfairly required consumers to waive its liability as to consumers\u2019 garnishment-related protections in its deposit agreement and misrepresented to consumers that they could not go to court to attempt to prevent wrongful garnishments. This conduct violated the CFPA. The Bureau also found that Bank of America failed to disclose to courts in states that restricted the garnishment of out-of-state accounts that the garnishment notice pertained to bank accounts located out-of-state; and Bank of America froze accounts and sent funds to creditors even though prohibited by state law. Bank of America also in some instances applied the wrong state\u2019s exemption laws and represented to consumers that their rights to have certain funds exempted from garnishment were governed by the law of the issuing state when in reality the consumer\u2019s own state law applies. The consent order requires Bank of America to refund at least $592,000 in, or cancel, associated unlawful garnishment-related fees and pay a $10 million civil money penalty. The order also requires Bank of America to review and reform its system for processing garnishments, to notify courts or other garnishment issuers when consumer accounts are out-of-state, and to cease using language in its consumer contracts that unlawfully limit consumers\u2019 rights to challenge garnishments.",

On January 3, 2017, the Bureau issued an order against the TransUnion Companies to address the Bureau\u2019s findings that they deceptively marketed credit scores and credit-related products, including credit monitoring, to consumers. In this action, the Bureau filed an amended complaint on May 24, 2023, which alleges that the TransUnion Companies and Danaher have violated multiple requirements of the Bureau\u2019s Order in violation of the Consumer Financial Protection Act (CFPA), including enrolling consumers in negative option products without obtaining required consents; failing to offer a simple mechanism for cancelling products; and failing to provide required disclosures. The Bureau also alleges that Danaher substantially assisted TransUnion Interactive, Inc. in violating the Order. The Bureau also alleges that the TransUnion Companies\u2019 marketing and sale of its credit-related products have, in several ways, been deceptive in violation of the CFPA, including by misrepresenting that products were free or $1; misrepresenting that credit card or other payment information provided by consumers would be used for identification purposes rather than payment; misrepresenting the central characteristics of its VantageScore credit score; and misrepresenting that cancellation of products would publicly expose the consumer\u2019s personal information and that re-enrolling in the product is the only way consumers can protect their information. The Bureau also alleges that TransUnion and Trans Union LLC substantially assisted TransUnion Interactive, Inc. in both violations of the Order and the deceptive conduct. The Bureau further alleges that the TransUnion Companies\u2019 advertisement of credit-related products on annualcreditreport.com, a website intended to provide consumers access to free credit reports, undermined the purpose the website, in violation of Regulation V. Also, the Bureau alleges that the TransUnion Companies violated the Electronic Fund Transfer Act (EFTA) and its implementing regulation, Regulation E, by failing to obtain required written authorization for recurring charges to consumers\u2019 debit cards and for failing to provide consumers with copies of such authorizations. Finally, the complaint alleges that by violating EFTA, Regulation E, and Regulation V, the TransUnion Companies have violated the CFPA.

    "description": "On March 30, 2022, the Bureau issued an order against Edfinancial Services, LLC. (Edfinancial). Edfinancial, headquartered in Knoxville, Tennessee, is a student loan servicer that services both FFELP loans, which are loans from private companies, and Direct Loans, which are loans directly from the Department of Education. The Public Service Loan Forgiveness (PSLF) Program is a government program that forgives student-loan debt for certain borrowers who work in public service and make 120 qualifying loan payments. Ordinarily, FFELP loans must be consolidated into Direct Loans before any payments qualify towards the PSLF program; but in October 2021 the Department of Education provided a limited waiver allowing payments to FFELP loans to retroactively qualify so long as the borrower consolidated into Direct Loans by a certain date. The Bureau found that Edfinancial made various deceptive statements to FFELP borrowers, including in many instances telling borrowers that they were not eligible for the PSLF program even though borrowers could become eligible by consolidating their loans; that borrowers could not consolidate their loans; that borrowers\u2019 past payments qualified when they did not qualify; and that qualifying jobs did not qualify for PSLF. The Bureau also found that, in numerous instances, when FFELP borrowers asked about forgiveness options available to them, Edfinancial\u2019s representatives did not mention PSLF as an available option. The consent order requires Edfinancial to contact all its FFELP borrowers to inform them of the limited waiver so that eligible borrowers can take advantage of the waiver before it expires. The limited waiver is currently set to expire by October 31, 2022. The order also requires Edfinancial to pay a $1 million civil money penalty.",

On June 21, 2022, the Bureau filed an amended complaint adding 18 additional FirstCash subsidiaries as defendants in the lawsuit: FCFS AL, Inc.; Cash America East, Inc.; Cash America Inc. of Alaska; Georgia Cash America, Inc.; FCFS IN, Inc.; FCFS TN, Inc.; FCFS OH, Inc.; FCFS KY, Inc.; Cash America, Inc. of Louisiana; FCFS MO, Inc.; Cash America of Missouri, Inc.; Cash America, Inc. of North Carolina; FCFS NC, Inc.; FCFS OK, Inc.; FCFS SC, Inc.; Pawn TX, Inc.; Cash America Pawn L.P.; and Cash America Advance, Inc. FirstCash owns and operates over 1,000 retail pawnshops in the United States, offering pawn loans through its wholly owned corporate subsidiaries. The Bureau alleges that FirstCash and its subsidiaries made pawn loans to active-duty servicemembers and their dependents that violated the Military Lending Act (MLA). The MLA puts in place protections in connection with extensions of consumer credit for active-duty servicemembers and certain dependents, who are defined as \u201ccovered borrowers.\u201d These protections include a maximum allowable annual percentage rate of 36%, known as a Military Annual Percentage Rate (MAPR), a prohibition against required arbitration, and certain mandatory loan disclosures. The Bureau alleges that between June 2017 and May 2021, FirstCash and its subsidiary Cash America West, which operates FirstCash\u2019s pawn stores in Arizona, Nevada, Utah, and Washington, made over 3,600 pawn loans to more than 1,000 covered borrowers that violated prohibitions of the MLA by imposing a MAPR greater than the MLA\u2019s 36% cap; using loan agreements requiring arbitration in the case of a dispute; and without making required loan disclosures. The Bureau further alleges that since October 3, 2016, FirstCash has, together with its wholly owned subsidiaries, made additional pawn loans in violation of the MLA from stores in these and other states. In 2013, the Bureau ordered Cash America International, Inc. to halt its misconduct against military families, prohibiting Cash America and its successors from violating the MLA. FirstCash is a successor to Cash America and therefore subject to the 2013 order. In this action, the Bureau alleges that FirstCash\u2019s violations of the MLA violated the prohibitions of the Bureau\u2019s 2013 order and consequently the Consumer Financial Protection Act of 2010. The Bureau\u2019s complaint seeks redress for consumers, injunctive relief, and a civil money penalty.",

In the joint complaint, DOJ also alleged that Trustmark\u2019s conduct violated the Fair Housing Act (FHA). The Consent Order, as entered by the court on October 27, 2021, requires Trustmark to invest $3.85 million in a loan subsidy program that will offer qualified applicants for credit secured by properties in majority Black and Hispanic neighborhoods in Memphis loans on a more affordable basis than otherwise available from Trustmark; open a new loan production office in a majority Black and Hispanic neighborhood in the Memphis MSA; fund targeted advertising to generate applications for credit from qualified consumers in majority Black and Hispanic neighborhoods in Memphis; and take other remedial steps to improve its fair lending compliance and serve the credit needs of majority Black and Hispanic neighborhoods in the Memphis MSA. The order also requires Trustmark to pay a civil money penalty of $5 million, $4 million of which would be remitted as a penalty paid to the Office of the Comptroller of the Currency for FHA violations arising from the same conduct alleged in the complaint.",

On January 7, 2022, the Bureau filed an amended complaint. The Bureau alleged that Credit Repair Cloud and Daniel Rosen violated the Telemarketing Sales Rule by providing substantial assistance to credit repair businesses that violated the Telemarketing Sales Rule\u2019s advance-fee prohibition. Specifically, the Bureau alleged that Mr. Rosen and Credit Repair Cloud encouraged the credit repair businesses that use their services \u2014 including Credit Repair Cloud\u2019s trainings, materials, and software \u2014 to telemarket and charge unlawful advance fees. The Bureau further alleged that Mr. Rosen and Credit Repair Cloud knew or consciously avoided knowing that these credit repair businesses were telemarketing their services and charging consumers unlawful advance fees. The Bureau also alleged that by violating the Telemarketing Sales Rule, Credit Repair Cloud and Daniel Rosen violated the Consumer Financial Protection Act of 2010.

    "description": "On September 8, 2021, the Bureau filed a lawsuit in the United States District Court for the Northern District of California against LendUp Loans, LLC. LendUp is an online lender offering single-payment and installment loans to consumers. The Bureau alleged that LendUp\u2019s brand identity is tied to its marketing claims that, that through on-time payments and repeat borrowing, borrowers will accrue points and ascend the \u201cLendUp Ladder,\u201d gaining access to loans with more favorable interest rates or larger loan amounts as consumers reach higher Ladder levels. In 2016, the Bureau issued an administrative consent order against LendUp to address the Bureau\u2019s finding that LendUp misled consumers about the benefits of its loans. That order prohibits LendUp from misrepresenting the benefits of borrowing from the company. In this action, the Bureau alleged that, though LendUp claimed that consumers who ascended the LendUp Ladder would gain access to lower interest rates and larger loans, many borrowers did not actually get those benefits. The Bureau alleged that LendUp\u2019s marketing claims were deceptive under the Consumer Financial Protection Act of 2010 and violated the prohibitions of the Bureau\u2019s 2016 order. The Bureau also alleged that LendUp failed to timely issue required adverse-action notices and failed to provide accurate denial reasons on its adverse-action notices to thousands of loan applicants, in violation of the Equal Credit Opportunity Act and Regulation B, and that these violations also constitute violations of the CFPA.",

    "description": "On June 28, 2021, the Bureau filed a lawsuit in the United States District Court for the Northern District of Georgia, and on the following day, the Bureau filed a proposed stipulated final judgment and order against Burlington Financial Group, LLC, and its principals, Richard Burnham, Katherine Burnham, and Sang Yi, which the court entered the same day. Burlington Financial is a Maryland-based company offering debt-relief and credit-repair services. The Bureau alleged that Burlington Financial and its principals used telemarketing to solicit consumers with false promises that Burlington\u2019s services would eliminate their credit-card debts and improve their credit scores. The Bureau alleged that Burlington and its principals charged advance fees for debt-relief and credit-repair services in violation of the Telemarketing Sales Rule (TSR) and engaged in deceptive acts or practices to market and sell Burlington\u2019s services in violation of the TSR and Consumer Financial Protection Act of 2010. The Bureau also alleged that the principals substantially assisted in the company\u2019s violations of the TSR and CFPA. The Bureau filed its complaint jointly with the Attorney General for the State of Georgia. The order bans Burlington and its principals from telemarking with respect to any consumer-financial product or service and from offering, marketing, selling, or providing any financial-advisory, debt-relief, or credit-repair service. The order also requires Burlington and its principals to pay civil money penalties totaling $150,001, $15,000 of which will be remitted upon Burlington\u2019s payment of a penalty in that amount to Georgia, and it imposes a judgment for redress of $30,457,853, to be suspended upon payment of the civil money penalties.",

The complaint specifically alleges that Douglas MacKinnon transferred ownership of his home, valued at approximately $1.6 million, to his wife and daughter for $1 shortly after he learned that the Bureau and the State of New York were investigating him for illegal debt-collection activities. That investigation resulted in a $60 million judgment against Douglas MacKinnon and the companies he operated and permanently banned him from the industry.

(Libre), and their principals, Micheal Donovan, Richard Moore, and Evan Ajin. Libre is a wholly owned subsidiary of Nexus Services, and both are non-banks with their principal places of business in Virginia. The Bureau alleges that Libre and its owners operate a scheme through which Libre offers to pay immigration bonds to secure the release of consumers held in federal detention centers in exchange for large upfront fees and hefty monthly payments, and that Libre creates the impression that it has paid cash for consumers\u2019 bonds, creating a debt that must be repaid to Libre through an upfront fee and subsequent monthly payments. The Bureau further alleges that Libre\u2019s efforts to collect monthly payments include making false threats and threatening to re-detain or deport consumers for non-payment and that Libre and its owners conceal or misrepresent the true costs of its services. Specifically, the Bureau alleges that Libre and its owners engaged in deceptive and abusive acts or practices in violation of the Consumer Financial Protection Act of 2010, and that Nexus Services and Libre\u2019s owners provided substantial assistance to Libre\u2019s violations. The Bureau filed its complaint jointly with the Attorneys General of Virginia, Massachusetts, and New York. On March 1, 2021, the defendants filed a motion to dismiss the complaint, which the court denied on March 22, 2022. On February 7, 2023, the magistrate judge ordered defendants to show cause why the district court should not sanction them\u2014including through entrance of default judgment\u2014for various violations of court orders. On May 1, 2023, the defendants filed a motion for judgment on the pleadings, and on May 11, 2023, the district court found the defendants in civil contempt and entered default against them. The court also denied as moot the defendants\u2019 motion for judgment on the pleadings. Defendants appealed the district court\u2019s denial of their motion for judgment on the pleadings, and on February 21, 2024, the Fourth Circuit dismissed the appeal on the ground it lacked jurisdiction. On April 1, 2024, the district court granted final judgment to the Bureau and the states. The court ordered: defendants to pay $230,996,970.84 in consumer redress; each defendant to pay the Bureau $111,135, 620 in civil money penalties; and defendants to pay $24,390,000 in penalties to the states. The court also, among other restrictions, enjoined defendants from requiring consumers to wear a GPS device or collect payments related to GPS monitoring. The court also required defendants to make certain clear and prominent disclosures in writing, including: the terms of products or services; associated fees; and that non-payment or noncompliance will not have any impact on a consumer\u2019s immigration status or associated immigration proceeding.",

    "description": "On January 15, 2021, the Bureau filed a lawsuit against 1st Alliance Lending, LLC, John Christopher DiIorio, Kevin Robert St. Lawrence, and Socrates Aramburu. 1st Alliance, based in Hartford, Connecticut, originated residential mortgages from 2004 to September 2019 and stopped operating in November 2019. DiIorio was its chief executive officer and he, St. Lawrence, and Aramburu were 1st Alliance\u2019s three managing executives. The Bureau\u2019s complaint alleges that 1st Alliance engaged in various unlawful mortgage lending practices in violation of the Truth in Lending Act (TILA), the Fair Credit Reporting Act (FCRA), the Equal Credit Opportunity Act (ECOA), the Mortgage Acts and Practices\u2014Advertising Rule (MAP Rule); and that 1st Alliance, DiIorio, St. Lawrence, and Aramburu engaged in unfair and deceptive practices under the Consumer Financial Protection Act of 2010 (CFPA). The Bureau filed an amended complaint on April 1, 2021. The Bureau\u2019s amended complaint seeks injunctions against the defendants, as well as damages, redress to consumers, disgorgement of ill-gotten gains, and the imposition of a civil money penalty. 1st Alliance and the individual defendants filed motions to dismiss on May 11, 2021, which on March 31, 2022, the court denied as to all but one claim against the individual defendants, which it dismissed without prejudice. On March 13, 2023, the parties filed a joint stipulation dismissing certain counts and all claims against defendant Socrates Aramburu, which the court docketed on March 14, 2023. The case remains pending against the remaining defendants.",

Omni, which has its principal place of business in Las Vegas, Nevada, and operates using the names Omni Financial and Omni Military Loans, specializes in originating installment loans to consumers affiliated with the military. It originates tens of thousands of loans each year, with individual loans typically ranging from $500 to $10,000. The Bureau found that Omni violated the Military Lending Act\u2019s prohibition on requiring repayment of loans by allotment. The Bureau also found that Omni violated the Electronic Fund Transfer Act\u2019s (EFTA) prohibition against requiring that consumers preauthorize electronic fund transfers as a condition of receiving credit. The Bureau further found that these violations of EFTA constituted violations of the Consumer Financial Protection Act of 2010. The consent order requires that Omni pay a $2.175 million civil money penalty and imposes injunctive relief to stop ongoing violations and prevent future violations.",

These violations of the FCRA and Regulation V constituted violations of the Consumer Financial Protection Act of 2010 and could have negatively impacted consumers\u2019 credit scores and access to credit in many instances.

The Student Loan Corporation and Discover Products, Inc., are affiliates of Discover Bank, and also engage in student loan servicing. The Bureau previously issued a consent order against Discover in July 2015 (2015 Order). The Bureau\u2019s 2015 Order was based on, among other things, the Bureau\u2019s finding that Discover misstated the minimum amounts due on billing statements and tax information consumers needed to get federal income tax benefits. The Bureau found that Discover violated the 2015 Order\u2019s requirements in several ways. Discover misrepresented the minimum loan payments consumers owed, the amount of interest consumers paid, and other material information, such as interest rates, payments, and due dates. Discover also did not provide all of the consumer redress the 2015 Order required. The Bureau also found that Discover engaged in unfair acts and practices by withdrawing payments from consumers\u2019 accounts without valid authorization and by cancelling or not withdrawing payments without notifying consumers. This conduct violated the Consumer Financial Protection Act of 2010 (CFPA), the Electronic Fund Transfer Act, and Regulation E. The Bureau also found that Discover engaged in deceptive acts and practices in violation of the CFPA by misrepresenting minimum payments consumers owed and the amount of interest consumers paid. The consent order requires Discover to pay at least $10 million in consumer redress and a $25 million civil money penalty and contains requirements to prevent future violations.",

The Bureau found that since the 2013 effective date of the Remittance Transfer Rule, La Nacional engaged in thousands of violations of the Electronic Fund Transfer Act and the Remittance Transfer Rule by: failing to properly honor cancellation requests, failing to develop and maintain required policies and procedures for error resolution, failing to investigate and make error determinations, failing to provide consumers with written reports of its investigation findings, failing to refund certain fees and taxes, failing to treat international bill pay services as remittance transfers, failing to disclose the appropriate currency on prepayment disclosures and receipts, failing to use the term \u201ctransfer fees\u201d or a substantially similar term in certain disclosures, and issuing receipts that failed to disclose the date on which remittance transfers would be available for pick-up. The consent order requires La Nacional to adopt a compliance plan to ensure that its remittance transfer acts and practices comply with all applicable Federal consumer financial laws and the consent order. The order also requires La Nacional to pay a civil money penalty of $750,000. This is the fourth action stemming from a Bureau sweep to address violations of the Remittance Transfer Rule.",

(Seterus), a former mortgage servicer based in North Carolina, and Kyanite Services, Inc. (Kyanite), Seterus\u2019s former parent company and its successor in interest. The consent order addresses widespread failures in Seterus\u2019s handling and processing of struggling homeowners\u2019 applications for loss mitigation options to avoid foreclosure. The Bureau found that Seterus, which used automated processes for handling loss mitigation applications, violated the Consumer Financial Protection Act of 2010\u2019s (CFPA) prohibition of unfair acts and practices by systematically failing to accurately review, process, track, and communicate to borrowers information regarding their applications, and deceptive acts and practices by sending numerous borrowers acknowledgment notices regarding their applications that misrepresented the status of borrower documents and provided inaccurate due dates for submission of borrower documents. The Bureau also found that Seterus violated Regulation X, which implements the Real Estate Settlement Procedures Act, by sending numerous acknowledgment notices that failed to state the additional documents and information borrowers needed to submit to complete their loss mitigation applications or failed to provide a reasonable due date for submission of borrower documents; failing to exercise reasonable diligence in obtaining documents and information necessary to complete borrowers\u2019 loss mitigation applications; failing to properly evaluate borrowers who submitted complete loss mitigation applications for all loss mitigation options available to the borrower; and failing to treat certain applications as \u201cfacially complete\u201d when required under Regulation X. These violations also constitute violations of the CFPA. The consent order requires Kyanite, as Seterus\u2019s successor in interest, to pay $4,932,525 in total redress to approximately 11,866 of the consumers to whom Seterus sent a defective acknowledgment notice. The consent order also imposes a $500,000 civil money penalty and includes injunctive relief that would apply in the event Kyanite engages in mortgage servicing operations.",

The Bureau alleged that since at least 2015, in the course of administering these bad-check pretrial-diversion programs, BounceBack used district-attorney letterheads to threaten more than 19,000 consumers with prosecution if they did not pay the amount of the check, enroll and pay for a financial-education course, and pay various other fees. BounceBack did not reveal to consumers that BounceBack\u2014and not district attorneys\u2014sent the letters, or that district attorneys almost never prosecuted these cases, even against consumers who ignored BounceBack\u2019s threats. In fact, in most cases, BounceBack did not refer cases for prosecution at all. BounceBack\u2019s letters also failed to include disclosures required under the Fair Debt Collection Practices Act (FDCPA).

Through 2012, RAB, a New Jersey company, purchased and collected consumer debts from debt brokers, and through August 2014, it used collections law firms to obtain judgments against consumers. RAB has continued to collect on those judgments against consumers as well as on a handful of payment agreements it obtained from debtors. The Bureau found that during the period that RAB was obtaining judgments against consumers, RAB threatened to sue, sued, and demanded payment from consumers in Connecticut, New Jersey, and Rhode Island even though RAB did not hold the licenses that those states required to sue to collect debts. Thus, RAB was not legally entitled to take the actions that it threatened to take against consumers in those states. The Bureau found that RAB misrepresented that it had a legally enforceable right to recover payments from consumers in these states through the judicial process in violation of the Fair Debt Collection Practices Act (FDCPA) and the Consumer Financial Protection Act of 2010 (CFPA). The consent order prohibits RAB from collecting on the judgments against, or payment agreements from, consumers it obtained in Connecticut, New Jersey, and Rhode Island when RAB did not hold a required debt-collection license in those states. It also requires RAB to take all necessary steps to vacate those judgments and suspend collection of those judgments and to notify consumers with payment agreements that they have been satisfied.

Nationstar is one of the nation\u2019s largest mortgage servicers and the largest non-bank mortgage servicer in the United States. The proposed judgment and order, which the court entered on December 8, 2020, requires Nationstar to pay approximately $73 million in redress to more than 40,000 harmed borrowers.

The orders in the Bureau\u2019s and the States\u2019 actions have yielded nearly $85 million in recoveries for consumers to date and over $6 million more in fees and penalties. They are also part of a larger government effort, which also includes assistance from the Special Inspector General for the Troubled Asset Relief Program (SIGTARP) and the United States Trustee Program, to address Nationstar\u2019s alleged unlawful mortgage loan servicing practices.",

The Bureau alleged that LendUp violated the Military Lending Act (MLA) in connection with its extensions of credit. The Bureau alleged that since October 2016, LendUp has made over 4,000 single-payment or installment loans to over 1,200 covered borrowers in violation of the MLA. The Bureau specifically alleged that LendUp\u2019s violations of the MLA include extending loans with an annual percentage rate that exceeds the MLA\u2019s 36% cap, extending loans that require borrowers to submit to arbitration, and failing to make certain required loan disclosures.

The settlement requires LendUp to provide $300,000 in redress to consumers and to pay a $950,000 civil money penalty. The settlement also enjoins LendUp from committing future violations of the MLA and from collecting on, selling, or assigning any debts arising from loans that failed to comply with the MLA.

    "description": "On November 20, 2020, the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau (Bureau) filed a lawsuit against FDATR, Inc. (FDATR), and its owners, Dean Tucci and Kenneth Wayne Halverson. FDATR was a corporation headquartered in Wood Dale, Illinois, that promised to provide student-loan debt-relief and credit-repair services to consumers nationwide. FDATR involuntarily dissolved in September 2020. Tucci and Halverson both owned and managed FDATR. The Bureau alleges that FDATR, Tucci, and Halverson violated the Telemarketing Sales Rule (TSR) by engaging in deceptive and abusive telemarketing acts or practices and the Consumer Financial Protection Act of 2010 (CFPA) by engaging in deceptive acts or practices. The Bureau\u2019s complaint, filed in the United States District Court for the Northern District of Illinois, seeks injunctions against FDATR, Tucci, and Halverson, as well as damages, redress to consumers, disgorgement of ill-gotten gains, and the imposition of civil money penalties. On February 25, 2021, the Bureau filed a notice of voluntary dismissal of Halverson, now deceased, and the court dismissed him from this action the next day. On February 7, 2022, the Bureau obtained a default judgment and order against FDATR imposing $2,117,133.28 in consumer redress, a $41,123,897 civil money penalty, and injunctive relief permanently banning it from offering or providing financial advisory, debt-relief, or credit-repair services and from telemarketing consumer financial products or services.",

The Bureau also determined, based on these violations of the FCRA and Regulation V, that Afni violated the Consumer Financial Protection Act. The consent order requires Afni to take certain steps to improve and ensure the accuracy of its furnishing and its policies and procedures relating to credit reporting and dispute investigation.

    "description": "On September 21, 2020, the Bureau issued a consent order against Lobel Financial Corporation, an auto-loan servicer based in Anaheim, California. The Bureau found that Lobel engaged in unfair practices with respect to its Loss Damage Waiver (LDW) product, in violation of the Consumer Financial Protection Act (CFPA). When a borrower has insufficient insurance, rather than force-placing collateral-protection insurance, Lobel places the LDW product, which is not itself insurance, on borrower accounts and charges a monthly premium. The LDW product provides that Lobel will pay for the cost of covered repairs and, in the event of a total vehicle loss, cancel the borrower\u2019s debt. The Bureau\u2019s investigation found that, since 2012, Lobel charged customers LDW premiums after they had become ten-days delinquent on their auto loans but did not provide them with LDW coverage. The Bureau also found that Lobel charged some customers LDW-related fees that Lobel had not disclosed in its LDW contract and that these practices were unfair under the CFPA. The order requires Lobel to pay $1,345,224 in consumer redress to approximately 4,000 harmed consumers and a $100,000 civil money penalty. The order also prohibits Lobel from failing to provide consumers with LDW coverage or similar products or services for which it has charged consumers or from charging consumers fees that are not authorized by its LDW contracts.",

The individual defendants are Christopher Di Re, Scott Croce, and Susan Croce, who have held ownership interests in some or all of the defendant companies, and Brian Koziel and Marc Gracie, who are members of Keystone Recovery Group, and have acted as managers of some or all of the defendant companies. Susan Croce is also a relief defendant. The complaint alleged that from at least 2015 through the present, the defendants have participated in a debt-collection operation that has used deceptive, harassing, and improper methods to induce consumers to make payments to them in violation of the Fair Debt Collection Practices Act and the Consumer Financial Protection Act of 2010.",

    "description": "On July 15, 2020, the Bureau filed a lawsuit against Townstone Financial, Inc., a nonbank retail-mortgage creditor and broker based in Chicago, Illinois. The Bureau alleges that Townstone violated the Equal Credit Opportunity Act (ECOA); its implementing regulation, Regulation B; and the Consumer Financial Protection Act (CFPA). For years, Townstone drew almost no applications for properties in majority-African-American neighborhoods located in the Chicago-Naperville-Elgin Metropolitan Statistical Area (Chicago MSA) and few applications from African Americans throughout the Chicago MSA. The Bureau alleges that Townstone engaged in discriminatory acts or practices, including making statements during its weekly radio shows and podcasts through which it marketed its services, that discouraged prospective African-American applicants from applying for mortgage loans; discouraged prospective applicants living in African-American neighborhoods in the Chicago MSA from applying for mortgage loans; and discouraged prospective applicants living in other areas from applying for mortgage loans for properties located in African-American neighborhoods in the Chicago MSA. On November 25, 2020, the Bureau filed an amended complaint, which added as a defendant Barry Sturner, Townstone\u2019s cofounder, sole owner, and sole director, as the fraudulent transferee of more than $2.4 million from Townstone. The defendants filed a motion to dismiss the amended complaint on February 8, 2021, which the court granted on February 3, 2023. The Bureau appealed, and, on July 11, 2024, the Seventh Circuit held that \u201can analysis of the text of the ECOA as a whole makes clear that the text prohibits not only outright discrimination against applicants for credit, but also the discouragement of prospective applicants for credit\u201d and that \u201cRegulation B\u2019s prohibition on the discouragement of prospective applications is consistent with the plain text of the ECOA.\u201d The court reversed the district court\u2019s decision and remanded the case for further proceedings. On November 1, 2024, the Bureau filed a proposed stipulated final judgment and order against Townstone, which, if approved by the court, would prohibit Townstone from engaging in any acts or practices that violate ECOA in connection with offering or providing mortgage loans. It would also require Townstone to maintain a compliance management system and policies and procedures designed to ensure and test compliance with ECOA, provide ongoing education and training for employees, and pay a $105,000 civil money penalty. The Bureau also filed a stipulation of dismissal of its claim against Sturner.",

Among other things, the Bureau sought $11.8 million in redress for harmed consumers.",

The Bureau alleged that Loan Doctor and Radjabli made several false, misleading, and inaccurate marketing representations in advertising Loan Doctor\u2019s \u201cHealthcare Finance (HCF) Savings CD Account,\u201d in violation of the Consumer Financial Protection Act of 2010\u2019s prohibition against deceptive acts or practices. The Bureau alleged that, starting in August 2019, Loan Doctor took millions of dollars from at least 400 consumers who opened and deposited money into Loan Doctor\u2019s deceptively advertised product. On December 9, 2022, the court entered a stipulated final judgment and order which requires defendants to pay a civil money penalty of $391,530, of which $241,530 will be remitted because of defendants\u2019 satisfaction of their obligation to pay that amount in penalties to the Securities and Exchange Commission for related conduct inSEC v. Radjabli et al., 2:21-cv-01761. The order also requires redress to consumers in the form of a refund of all the deposits made with defendants, including all interest due to consumers under the advertised terms of the purchased financial products and services. Defendants have represented to the Bureau that they have already satisfied the obligation to provide redress because they already refunded the full amount received from consumers, plus all interest due to consumers under the terms advertised. The Bureau estimates the redress amount to be approximately $19 million, but an exact calculation has not yet been completed. The order also permanently bans the defendants from engaging or assisting others in any deposit-taking activities.",

The Bureau found that during this period, when consumers called NAA or NAM to complain about errors on their consumer reports relating to their financing with Harbour, they were sometimes told that they had to file a dispute with the consumer-reporting agency. These representations were inaccurate and constituted deceptive acts and practices in violation of the Consumer Financial Protection Act. The Bureau also found that NAM lacked adequate policies and procedures to protect the accuracy and integrity of information furnished to consumer-reporting agencies, in violation of Regulation V. Under the settlement, Harbour will pay a $25,000 civil money penalty to the Bureau, and NAA and NAM will jointly pay a $10,000 civil money penalty to the Bureau.

The consent order imposes a judgment against Approved Cash of approximately $3.5 million in redress, which amount is suspended upon its payment of $2 million of that judgment and $1 civil money penalty to the Bureau based on Approved Cash\u2019s demonstrated inability to pay. The consent order also prohibits Approved Cash from misrepresenting finance charges in its auto-title pledge transactions, requires it to ensure that consumers with credit balances over $1 are refunded timely, and prohibits it from engaging in the unlawful debt collections practices in which it was engaging.",

    "description": "On June 5, 2019, the Bureau issued an order against Freedom Mortgage Corporation (Freedom), a mortgage lender with its principal place of business in Mount Laurel, New Jersey. Freedom is one of the ten largest Home Mortgage Disclosure Act (HMDA) reporters nationwide; for each year from 2013 through 2016, it originated more than 50,000 home-purchase loans, including refinancings of home-purchase loans. The Bureau found that Freedom violated HMDA and its implementing regulation, Regulation C, by submitting mortgage-loan data for 2014 to 2017 that contained errors. Specifically, the Bureau found that Freedom reported inaccurate race, ethnicity, and sex information and that much of Freedom\u2019s loan officers\u2019 recording of this incorrect information was intentional. For example, certain loan officers were told by managers or other loan officers that, when applicants did not provide their race or ethnicity, they should select non-Hispanic white regardless of whether that was accurate. The order requires Freedom to pay a $1.75 million civil money penalty and take steps to improve its compliance management to prevent future violations.",

The Bureau alleged that from 2014 through 2016, fewer than a dozen attorneys at Forster & Garbus filed more than 99,000 debt-collection lawsuits, while having documents to support only a fraction of those debts. The Bureau alleged that these lawsuits were filed without meaningful attorney involvement, and thus the signatures of attorneys on these lawsuits violated the Fair Debt Collection Practices Act\u2019s prohibition against the use of false, deceptive, or misleading representations or means to collect a debt and the Consumer Financial Protection Act of 2010\u2019s prohibition against deceptive acts and practices. On January 18, 2023, the court entered a stipulated final judgment and order, which requires Forster & Garbus to possess specific documents supporting consumer debts and have an attorney review these documents before filing any new lawsuit, and to dismiss any pending lawsuit unless it certifies its compliance with these documentation and meaningful-attorney-involvement requirements. The order also requires Forster & Garbus to pay a civil money penalty of $100,000.",

Heath, Attorney at Law PC (Lexington Law), which does business as Lexington Law. Progrexion and Lexington Law offer and provide credit repair services through the brands Lexington Law and CreditRepair.com, which are two of the largest credit repair companies in the country. The Telemarketing Sales Rule (TSR) requires that fees for telemarketed credit repair services may only be sought and received after the credit repair company provides the consumer with documentation reflecting that the promised results were achieved more than six months after such results were achieved. As alleged in the amended complaint filed on August 17, 2022, Progrexion and Lexington Law violated the TSR by requesting and receiving prohibited upfront fees for their credit repair services. The Bureau also alleged that Progrexion and its subsidiaries violated the TSR and the Consumer Financial Protection Act of 2010 by making deceptive representations in its marketing, or by substantially assisting others in doing so, to entice consumers into purchasing credit repair services. On March 10, 2023, the district court ruled that defendants violated the TSR\u2019s prohibition on upfront fees andgranted the Bureau partial summary judgmentagainst the defendants. On August 28, 2023, the Bureau filed a proposed stipulated final judgment and order, which the court entered on August 30, 2023. The order imposes a judgment of $2,660,926,481 for consumer redress against all defendants, a civil money penalty of $45,817,452 against Progrexion, and a civil money penalty of $18,408,726 against Lexington Law. The order also imposes a 10-year ban on defendants\u2019 telemarketing credit repair services and requires them to send notices to remaining customers who were enrolled through telemarketing of the lawsuit and their right to cancel their credit repair services, among other injunctive relief.",

The Bureau alleges that they used inaccurate and incomplete information to service loans, misrepresented to borrowers that their loans had certain amounts due, illegally foreclosed on homeowners that were performing on agreements on loss mitigation options, failed to adequately investigate and respond to borrower complaints, and engaged in other conduct in violation of the CFPA, TILA, FDCPA, RESPA, and Homeowners Protection Act (HPA). On September 5, 2019, the district court rejected the majority of Ocwen\u2019s arguments in its motion to dismiss but required the Bureau to re-plead its allegations, which the Bureau did on October 4, 2019. The case was partially consolidated with a related case against Ocwen brought by the Office of the Attorney General and Office of Financial Regulation for the State of Florida, and the Florida plaintiffs settled their claims against Ocwen. On March 4, 2021, the district court granted in part defendants\u2019 Motion for Summary Judgment as to Counts 1-9 of the Bureau\u2019s First Amended Complaint based on res judicata. On April 19, 2021, the Bureau filed a Second Amended Complaint that dropped Count 10 of its First Amended Complaint and limited the claims set forth in Counts 1 through 9 to allegations of violations for the time period of January 2014 through February 26, 2017. On April 21, 2021, in light of the Bureau\u2019s recently filed Second Amended Complaint, the district court entered a Final Judgment in favor of the defendants.

As set forth in the July 14, 2022 amended complaint, the CFPB alleged that they made misrepresentations to potential borrowers and engaged in abusive practices in connection with cash advances on settlement payouts from victim-compensation funds. On May 15, 2017, the defendants filed a motion to dismiss the CFPB\u2019s complaint, which the CFPB opposed. On June 21, 2018, the court issued an opinion concluding that the defendants are subject to the CFPA\u2019s prohibitions and that the complaint properly pleaded claims against all of them. The court held, however, that the removal provision that applied to the CFPB\u2019s Director violated the constitutional separation of powers and could not be severed from the remainder of Title X of the Dodd-Frank Act. Based on that conclusion, the court ultimately dismissed the entire case. The United States Court of Appeals for the Second Circuit vacated the district court\u2019s judgment and remanded the case for further proceedings. On November 28, 2022, the district court entered a stipulated judgement, providing over $600,000 in debt relief for harmed consumers; injunctive relief barring the defendants from doing business with potential recipients of governmentally created 9/11 victim-compensation funds; and a civil money penalty of $1.",

(Pioneer). Navient Corporation is a nonbank that owns and services student loans. The Bureau alleges that Navient Solutions and Navient Corporation: (1) engaged in abusive and unfair acts and practices in violation of the Consumer Financial Protection Act of 2010 (CFPA) by steering borrowers experiencing long-term financial hardship into forbearance, a costly option designed for borrowers experiencing short-term financial hardship, instead of adequately advising them about more beneficial income-driven repayment plans; (2) engaged in unfair acts and practices in violation of the CFPA by failing to adequately notify borrowers who enrolled in an income-driven repayment plan about the requirement to annually recertify their income and family size as required under the plan; (3) engaged in deceptive acts and practices in violation of the CFPA by misleading borrowers about the consequences of submitting an incorrect or incomplete application to recertify their income and family size under an income-driven repayment plan; (4) engaged in deceptive acts and practices in violation of the CFPA by misleading private student loan borrowers about requirements to release their co-signer from the loan; (5) engaged in unfair acts and practices under the CFPA by making numerous payment processing errors, including by misallocating and misapplying borrower payments; and (6) violated the Fair Credit Reporting Act\u2019s implementing Regulation V by failing to establish and implement reasonable written policies and procedures to furnish accurate information to credit reporting agencies regarding borrowers who had received a discharge on their federal loans due to a total and permanent disability. The Bureau also alleges that Pioneer and Navient Corporation engaged in deceptive acts and practices in violation of the CFPA and Fair Debt Collection Practices Act by misleading borrowers about the effect of loan rehabilitation on their credit reports and the collection fees that would be forgiven in the federal loan rehabilitation program. On March 24, 2017, Navient moved to dismiss the complaint, which the court denied on August 4, 2017. On July 10, 2020, Navient filed a motion for judgment on the pleadings, which the court denied on January 13, 2021. On September 12, 2024, the Bureau filed a proposed stipulated judgment and order, which if entered by the court, would require defendants to pay $100 million in consumer redress and a $20 million penalty. The order would also, among other requirements, permanently ban Navient from servicing Direct Loans, prohibit Navient from conducting consumer-facing servicing activities for Federal Family Education Loan Program (FFELP) loans, and permanently ban Navient from acquiring additional FFELP loans.",

    "description": "On November 21, 2016, the Bureau filed a complaint against Access Funding, LLC, Access Holding, LLC, Reliance Funding, LLC, three of the companies\u2019 principals\u2014Lee Jundanian, Raffi Boghosian, and Michael Borkowski\u2014and a Maryland attorney, Charles Smith. The Bureau alleged that Access Funding was aware that the individuals from whom they purchased structured settlement payments were financially unsophisticated and in need of the funds the company could supply. The Bureau also alleged that the companies and their principals steered consumers to receive \u201cindependent advice\u201d from Smith, who was paid directly by Access Funding and only provided cursory communications to consumers. The Bureau alleged that Smith\u2019s conduct was unfair, abusive, and deceptive in violation of the Consumer Financial Protection Act of 2010 and that Access Funding and its leadership unlawfully aided Smith\u2019s illegal conduct and engaged in abusive conduct. The Bureau further alleged that Access Funding engaged in abusive conduct by advancing money to some consumers and represented to those consumers that the advances obligated them to go forward with transactions even if they realized that the transactions were not in their best interests. On September 13, 2017, the court granted defendants\u2019 motions to dismiss counts I\u2013IV, arising out of Smith\u2019s conduct, on the grounds that he had attorney-client relationships with the consumers in question. The court denied the defendants\u2019 motions to dismiss the Bureau\u2019s claim relating to the advances Access Funding offered consumers. The court granted the Bureau\u2019s motion to file an amended complaint alleging Smith did not have attorney-client relationships with the consumers in question. Defendants again filed motions to dismiss, which the court denied. The defendants filed a motion for partial summary judgment, which the court denied on January 18, 2019. On December 26, 2019, the court stayed the case pending the Supreme Court\u2019s decision inSeila Law LLC v. CFPB, No. 19-7 (cert. granted Oct. 18, 2019). On October 23, 2020, based on the parties\u2019 stipulation, the court dismissed the claims against Reliance Funding, LLC. The parties moved for summary judgment, which the Court denied on July 12, 2021.",

    "description": "On September 26, 2016, the Bureau took action against TitleMax parent company TMX Finance LLC, a specialty finance company that originates and services automobile-title loans through its affiliates operating out of approximately 1300 brick-and-mortar storefronts located in 18 states. Single-payment auto title loans are usually due in 30 days, with some carrying an annual percentage rate of up to 300 percent. The Bureau found that store employees, as part of their sales pitch for the 30-day loans, offered consumers a \u201cmonthly option\u201d for making loan payments and then offered consumers a \u201cVoluntary Payback Guide\u201d that showed how to repay the loan with smaller payments over a longer period. The guide and sales pitch did not explain the true cost of the loan if the consumer renewed it multiple times. The Bureau found that TMX Finance engaged in abusive conduct by materially interfering with consumers\u2019 ability to make an informed judgment about whether to pay off the loan over a longer period: it materially interfered with consumers\u2019 ability to understand that they are receiving a 30-day transaction, that the guide is not an actual repayment plan, and that renewing the transaction over an extended period of time would increase the overall costs of the transaction. TMX Finance also engaged in unfair debt collection practices by revealing information about consumers\u2019 past-due debts while visiting their homes, references, or places of employment. The Bureau ordered TMX Finance to stop its unlawful practices and pay a $9 million penalty.",

    "description": "The CFPB and the Department of Justice (DOJ) announced a joint action against BancorpSouth Bank for discriminatory mortgage lending practices that harmed African Americans and other minorities. The complaint filed by the CFPB and DOJ alleges that BancorpSouth engaged in numerous discriminatory practices, including illegally redlining in Memphis; denying certain African Americans mortgage loans more often than similarly situated non-Hispanic white applicants; charging African-American customers for certain mortgage loans more than non-Hispanic white borrowers with similar loan qualifications; and implementing an explicitly discriminatory loan denial policy. Under the terms of the consent order, BancorpSouth will pay $4 million in direct loan subsidies in minority neighborhoods in Memphis, at least $800,000 for community programs, advertising, outreach, and credit repair, $2.78 million to African-American consumers who were unlawfully denied or overcharged for loans, and a $3 million penalty.",

    "description": "The Consumer Financial Protection Bureau filed suit against payment processer Intercept Corporation and two of its executives, Bryan Smith and Craig Dresser, for allegedly enabling unauthorized and other illegal withdrawals from consumer accounts by their clients. In the suit filed in federal district court, the CFPB alleged that Intercept turned a blind eye to blatant warning signs of potential fraud or lawbreaking by its clients. These warning signs included previous actions by federal and state authorities, and sky-high rates of returned payments because of unauthorized withdrawals, insufficient funds, or invalid or closed accounts. In its suit, the CFPB sought to put an end to unlawful practices by Intercept, Smith, and Dresser; to obtain relief for consumers; and to impose penalties. The Court dismissed the lawsuit without prejudice.",

The CFPB found that David Eghbali referred a substantial number of loan closings to a single escrow company, which shifted its fees from some customers to others at Eghbali\u2019s request. Eghbali could then manipulate loan costs and ultimately increase the number of loans he closed, increasing his commissions.

The Bureau alleged that the defendants tried to keep consumers from learning how much they would be charged to cash a check and used deceptive tactics to stop consumers from backing out of transactions. The Bureau also alleged that the defendants made deceptive statements about the benefits of its high-cost payday loans and failed to provide refunds after consumers made overpayments on their loans. On November 10, 2022, the court entered a final settlement order, which requires Gray to pay a civil money penalty of $899,350, of which $889,350 was remitted due to a penalty of that amount being paid to the Mississippi Department of Banking and Consumer Finance. The settlement also prohibits Gray from reinstating the corporate defendants, which were dissolved on December 10, 2018.",

    "description": "On November 18, 2015, the Bureau filed a notice of charges against an online lender, Integrity Advance, LLC, and its CEO, James R. Carnes. The Bureau alleges that they deceived consumers about the cost of short-term loans and that the company\u2019s contracts did not disclose the costs consumers would pay under the default terms of the contracts. The Bureau also alleges that the company unfairly used remotely created checks to debit consumers\u2019 bank accounts even after the consumers revoked authorization for automatic withdrawals. The Bureau is seeking injunctive relief, restitution, and the imposition of a civil money penalty. On September 27, 2016, the Administrative Law Judge (ALJ) issued a Recommended Decision finding liability and recommending injunctive and monetary relief. The Recommended Decision was appealed to the Director, but further activity on that appeal was held in abeyance pending a decision inPHH Corp. v. CFPB, No. 15-1177 (D.C. Cir.), and, subsequently, pending a decision inLucia v. SEC, No. 17-0130 (S. Ct.). Subsequent to the Supreme Court\u2019s ruling in Lucia that suggested that the ALJ that presided over the proceedings in this case may have been improperly appointed, the Director remanded the case for a new hearing and recommended decision by the Bureau\u2019s ALJ. On March 26, 2020, Respondents moved to amend their answer, to reopen the record, and to dismiss the notice of charges. The ALJ denied these motions on April 24, 2020. In response to cross motions for summary disposition, on August 4, 2020, the ALJ issued a Recommended Decision finding in the Bureau\u2019s favor on all counts. Respondents noticed an appeal to the Director and filed their opening appeal brief on September 3, 2020.",

    "description": "On October 29, 2015, the Bureau filed a complaint against Global Financial Support, Inc. (Global Financial), which operates under the names Student Financial Resource Center and College Financial Advisory, and its owner and CEO, Armond Aria. The Bureau alleged that the defendants issued marketing letters instructing students to fill out a form and pay a fee in exchange for the company providing a financial aid program or conducting extensive searches to target or match students with individualized financial aid opportunities. The Bureau also alleged that consumers who paid the fee received nothing or a generic booklet that failed to provide individualized advice. The Bureau also alleged that the defendants misrepresented their affiliation with government and university financial aid offices and pressured consumers to enroll through deceptive statements. On January 25, 2021, the court granted in part the Bureau\u2019s motion for partial summary judgment against Armond Aria and default judgment against Global Financial, finding that 76,000 consumers purchased Global Financial\u2019s \u201cprogram\u201d based on its misrepresentations. On February 16, 2021, the Bureau filed an amended complaint dismissing the remaining claims against Aria. On March 29, 2021, the court entered a final judgment and order against both defendants imposing injunctive relief, $4,738,028 in restitution to consumers, and a $10 million civil money penalty. Armond Aria filed an appeal of the final judgment to the Ninth Circuit on May 19, 2021. On December 13, 2022, the Ninth Circuit affirmed the district court\u2019s decision in its entirety. On February 27, 2023, Aria filed a petition for rehearing or rehearing en banc, which the court denied on April 14, 2023.",

The Bureau found that Portfolio Recovery Associates bought debts that were potentially inaccurate, lacking documentation, or unenforceable. Without substantiating the debt, Portfolio Recovery Associates collected payments by pressuring consumers with false statements and churning out lawsuits using robo-signed court documents. The Bureau ordered Portfolio Recovery Associates to stop collections on $3 million worth of judgments, halt collection of future debts that could not be verified, and pay $19 million in consumer relief and an $8 million civil monetary penalty. The order also prohibited Portfolio Recovery Associates from (1) representing the amount or validity of a debt unless substantiated; (2) selling debt; (3) threatening or filing collection lawsuits without an intent to prove the debt; (4) filing false or misleading affidavits in debt-collection actions; (5) making false or misleading representations; and (6) suing on time-barred debt or otherwise collecting time-barred debt unless it complied with specified disclosure requirements.",

    "description": "On May 11, 2015, the Bureau filed a complaint against Nationwide Biweekly Administration, Inc., Loan Payment Administration LLC, and Daniel S. Lipsky alleging that they engaged in abusive and deceptive acts and practices in violation of the Consumer Financial Protection Act (CFPA) and the Telemarketing Sales Rule (TSR) regarding a mortgage payment product known as the \u201cInterest Minimizer Program,\u201d or IM Program. The Bureau alleges that the defendants misrepresented their affiliation with consumers\u2019 mortgage lenders; the amount of interest savings consumers would realize, and when consumers would achieve savings on the IM Program; consumers\u2019 ability to attain the purported savings on their own or through a low- or no-cost option offered by the consumers\u2019 servicer; and fees for the program. The Bureau sought a permanent injunction, consumer redress, and civil money penalties. A trial was held beginning on April 24, 2017, and on September 8, 2017, the court issued an opinion and order finding that the defendants had engaged in deceptive and abusive conduct in violation of the CFPA and TSR. The court imposed a $7.93 million civil money penalty, but denied the Bureau\u2019s request for restitution and disgorgement. On November 9, 2017, the court reduced the previous order to a judgment that includes permanently enjoining defendants from engaging in specified acts or practices. The court denied defendants\u2019 post-trial motions on March 12, 2018, and both parties filed a notice of appeal. On January 27, 2023, the United States Court of Appeals for the Ninth Circuit issued a decision vacating the district court\u2019s September 8, 2017 order and remanded the case to the district court to consider several issues raised on appeal. The Ninth Circuit\u2019s decision did not include a ruling on the merits of the parties\u2019 respective appeals. The case remains pending.",

The order required Regions to refund consumers illegally charged overdraft fees.

    "description": "On March 26, 2015, the Bureau filed a lawsuit against a group of seven debt collection agencies and six individual debt collectors, four payment processors and individual sales organizations, and a telephone marketing service provider alleging unlawful conduct related to a phantom debt collection operation. Phantom debt is debt that consumers do not actually owe or debt that is not payable to those attempting to collect it. The Bureau alleged that the individuals, acting through a network of corporate entities, used threats and harassment to collect phantom debt from consumers. The Bureau alleged the defendants violated the FDCPA and the CFPA\u2019s prohibition on unfair and deceptive acts and practices and substantial assistance to unfair or deceptive conduct. On April 7, 2015, the Bureau obtained a preliminary injunction against the debt collectors that froze their assets and enjoined their unlawful conduct. On August 25, 2017, as a discovery sanction against the Bureau, the court dismissed the Bureau\u2019s claims against the payment processors and the telephone marketing service provider: Frontline Processing Corp., Global Payments, Inc., Pathfinder Payment Solutions, Inc., Francis David Corp. d/b/a/ Electronic Merchant Systems, and Global Connect, LLC. The Bureau voluntarily dismissed one individual defendant, Varinderjit Bagga.",

Defendants included Richard Moseley, Sr., Richard Moseley, Jr., and 20 interrelated corporate entities controlled by Moseley, Sr. and Moseley, Jr. The Bureau alleged that the defendants obtained consumers\u2019 sensitive personal and financial information from third-party data brokers, and used that information to access consumers\u2019 bank accounts without authorization. According to the Bureau\u2019s complaint, the Hydra Group deposited loans in consumers\u2019 bank accounts, then debited biweekly \"finance charges\u201d indefinitely. In many cases, the Bureau alleged, consumers never saw loan agreements and were not aware of the account activity until after the loan was deposited and finance charges were withdrawn. Additionally, the Bureau alleged that, even when consumers did receive loan documents, the written disclosures misrepresented the price terms and repayment obligations of the purported loan. The Bureau alleged violations of the Consumer Financial Protection Act and other federal consumer financial laws.",

    "description": "On July 22, 2014, the Bureau filed a complaint against The Mortgage Law Group, LLP (TMLG), the Consumer First Legal Group, LLC (CFLG), and attorneys Thomas Macey, Jeffrey Aleman, Jason Searns, and Harold Stafford. The Bureau brought suit alleging that the defendants violated Regulation O, formerly known as the Mortgage Assistance Relief Services Rule, by taking payments from consumers for mortgage modifications before the consumers signed a mortgage modification agreement from their lender, by failing to make required disclosures, by directing consumers not to contact lenders, and by making deceptive statements to consumers when providing mortgage assistance relief services. A trial was held in April 2017. On June 21, 2017, the district court entered a stipulated judgment against the bankruptcy estate of TMLG, which sought Chapter 7 bankruptcy. The court enjoined TMLG from operating and ordered TMLG to pay $18,331,737 in redress and $20,815,000 in civil money penalties. On May 29, 2018, the Bureau filed an unopposed motion to increase the redress amount ordered by the court to $18,716,725.78, based on newly discovered information about additional advance fees paid by consumers. The amended stipulated judgment against TMLG increasing redress to $18,716,725.78 was issued by the court on November 15, 2018. On November 15, 2018, the court issued an opinion and order ruling that defendants CFLG, Macey, Aleman, Searns, and Stafford violated Regulation O by taking upfront fees and by failing to make required disclosures, and that some of the defendants also violated Regulation O by directing consumers not to contact their lenders and by making deceptive statements. The court directed that the parties submit briefs addressing what damages, injunctive relief, and civil money penalties, if any, should be awarded. On November 4, 2019, the court issued an opinion and order against defendants CFLG, Macey, Aleman, Searns, and Stafford, imposing a total of $21,709,022 in restitution ($18.7 million of which TMLG is also jointly and severally liable for) and $37,294,250 in civil money penalties. CFLG, Macey, Aleman, and Searns were permanently enjoined from marketing, selling, providing, or assisting others in selling or providing any mortgage-assistance-relief or debt-relief products or services. Stafford was enjoined from marketing, selling, providing, or assisting others in selling or providing mortgage-assistance-relief services for five years. CFLG, Macey, Aleman, Searns, and Stafford filed an appeal with the Seventh Circuit on December 4, 2019. On July 23, 2021, the Seventh Circuit affirmed the district court\u2019s rulings that defendants violated Regulation O, vacated the remedial order, and remanded to the district court for further proceedings on remedies. On August 1, 2022, the district court awarded $10,854,510.85 in restitution and $18,410,500 in penalties against the defendants, and imposed an eight-year ban on all the defendants except Stafford, whose five-year ban remained in place, on mortgage-assistance relief services. On August 11, 2022, defendants filed a notice of appeal, and the Bureau filed a notice of cross-appeal on September 15, 2022. On February 5, 2024, the remaining defendants entered into a settlement under which the parties dismissed their respective appeals, and on February 7, 2024, the Seventh Circuit dismissed the appeals. The settlement requires defendants to pay $10.9 million in consumer redress and a $1.1 million penalty. The individual defendants remain subject to the bans from the mortgage assistance industry under the district court\u2019s August 1, 2022 order.",

    "description": "On December 16, 2013, the Bureau filed a complaint in U.S. District Court for the District of Massachusetts against online loan servicer CashCall Inc.; its owner J. Paul Reddam; WS Funding, LLC, a subsidiary; and Delbert Services Corporation, an affiliate, for collecting money consumers did not owe. The Bureau\u2019s amended complaint, filed on March 21, 2014, alleges that the defendants violated the Consumer Financial Protection Act of 2010\u2019s prohibition against unfair, deceptive, and abusive acts or practices by collecting and attempting to collect consumer-installment loans that were void or uncollectible because they violated either state caps on interest rates or state licensing requirements for lenders. The Bureau alleges that CashCall serviced loans it made in the name of an entity, Western Sky, which was located on the Cheyenne River Sioux Tribe\u2019s land. The loan agreements included a choice-of-law provision saying that the Tribe\u2019s law applied to the loans. The case was transferred to the Central District of California, where defendants were based, on September 23, 2015. On August 31, 2016, the court granted the Bureau\u2019s motion for partial summary judgment, concluding that the choice-of-law provision in the loan agreements was not enforceable and that the law of the borrowers\u2019 states applied, resulting in the loans being void or uncollectible. Because the loans were void, the court found that the defendants engaged in deceptive acts or practices by demanding and collecting payment on debts that consumers did not owe. A two-day trial was held in October 2017 on the issue of appropriate relief. On January 19, 2018, the court issued findings of fact and conclusions of law imposing a $10.28 million civil money penalty but denying the Bureau\u2019s request for restitution and an injunction. The Bureau and the defendants appealed. On May 23, 2022, the Ninth Circuit affirmed the district court\u2019s finding of liability; vacated the district court\u2019s penalty, remanding for the district court to re-assess the penalty amount taking into account defendants\u2019 reckless conduct; and vacated the district court\u2019s decision to award no restitution, remanding to the district court to determine whether and what restitution would be appropriate in consideration of the Ninth Circuit Court\u2019s opinion. On February 10, 2023, the district court issued an order awarding the Bureau a $33,276,264 civil money penalty and $134,058,600 in restitution. On March 16, 2023, CashCall appealed the district court\u2019s final judgment. The case remains pending on appeal.",
