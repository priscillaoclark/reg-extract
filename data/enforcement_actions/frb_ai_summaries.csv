- Toronto-Dominion Bank was fined $123.5 million for failing to comply with anti-money laundering laws.
- TD failed to adequately manage and oversee its retail banking operations in the U.S., resulting in money laundering activities.
- The Board is requiring TD to implement enhanced measures to comply with anti-money laundering laws and correct its risk management deficiencies.
- TD is mandated to establish a new office in the U.S. dedicated to remediating the identified deficiencies, relocate parts of its compliance program responsible for U.S. law compliance to the U.S., allocate resources to correct deficiencies before issuing dividends, and conduct a review of its board and management.
- Canada's Office of the Superintendent of Financial Institutions can assist in implementing these requirements.
- The action is taken in conjunction with actions by other U.S. authorities totaling approximately $3.09 billion in penalties, with the bank also pleading guilty to criminal charges."
