VyStar Credit Union,https://www.consumerfinance.gov/enforcement/actions/vystar-credit-union/,2024-10-31T00:00:00,"On October 31, 2024, the Bureau issued an order against Vystar Credit Union.","On October 31, 2024, the Bureau issued an order against VyStar Credit Union (VyStar), a Jacksonville, Florida based credit union with approximately 850,000 members with deposit accounts. VyStar membership is open to, among others, those living or working in the 49 contiguous counties of Central to North Florida, 29 Georgia counties, and past and present military members and their families. In May 2022, VyStar attempted to launch a new online and mobile banking platform with a new and untested provider. The new system crashed upon launch because VyStar brought it online prematurely and failed to establish or follow critical processes to ensure its success. The online and mobile banking platform was taken offline soon after the conversion; and initially when it returned, it lacked key banking services, some of which were not restored for months. The outage and subsequent limited functionality of the banking platform impacted VyStar members in significant ways, including the assessment of fees for failures to make timely payments, restricted access to their funds, and the inability to effectively manage their accounts. These significant problems were foreseeable and avoidable. VyStar failed to have adequate system development, implementation, and release controls in place; maintained policies and procedures that were deficient, out of date, and not followed by senior management; and was deficient in its service provider oversight. VyStar pushed the conversion process through too quickly, despite warning signs from its own development team, to meet an unrealistic deadline, which caused VyStar to take on unnecessary risk of harm to its members. The Bureau found that VyStar’s planning and implementation of the conversion constituted an unfair practice in violation of the Consumer Financial Protection Act of 2010 that caused financial and non-financial harm to VyStar’s members, including fees, costs, and inconvenience. The order requires VyStar to come into compliance with the law, establish a governance committee to ensure proper management of projects involving consumer facing banking systems, ensure that all consumers owed redress have been paid, and pay a $1.5 million civil money penalty.","[{'text': 'Consent Order', 'link': 'https://files.consumerfinance.gov/f/documents/cfpb-vystar-credit-union-consent-order_2024-10.pdf'}, {'text': 'Stipulation', 'link': 'https://files.consumerfinance.gov/f/documents/cfpb-vystar-credit-union-stipulation_2024-10.pdf'}, {'text': 'CFPB Orders VyStar Credit Union to Pay $1.5 Million for Illegally Stranding Consumers from Accessing Their Money and Accounts', 'link': '/about-us/newsroom/cfpb-orders-vystar-credit-union-to-pay-1-5-million-for-illegally-stranding-consumers-from-accessing-their-money-and-accounts/'}, {'text': 'View case filings', 'link': '/administrative-adjudication-proceedings/administrative-adjudication-docket/vystar-credit-union/'}]",https://www.consumerfinance.gov/about-us/newsroom/cfpb-orders-vystar-credit-union-to-pay-1-5-million-for-illegally-stranding-consumers-from-accessing-their-money-and-accounts/,https://www.consumerfinance.gov/administrative-adjudication-proceedings/administrative-adjudication-docket/vystar-credit-union/,['Administrative Proceeding'],2024-CFPB-0013,"OCT 31, 2024",Post Order/Post Judgment,['Deposits']
Goldman Sachs Bank USA,https://www.consumerfinance.gov/enforcement/actions/goldman-sachs-bank-usa/,2024-10-23T00:00:00,"On October 23, 2024, the Bureau issued an order against Goldman Sachs Bank USA.","On October 23, 2024, the Bureau issued an order against Goldman Sachs Bank USA (Goldman). In December 2017, Goldman and Apple Inc. entered an agreement to offer Apple Card, a credit card integrated with Apple software that offers both market-rate APRs and interest-free financing for qualifying Apple products. Goldman agreed to extend the credit offered through Apple Card and to investigate disputes submitted by consumers. Apple designed the consumer-facing interfaces that consumers used to manage Apple Card accounts on Apple devices and developed the creative approach and design of Apple Card advertisements. Despite warnings to Goldman’s board on August 16, 2019 that the Apple Card disputes system was “not fully ready” due to technological issues, Goldman and Apple introduced the Apple card four days later on August 20, 2019. The Bureau found that Goldman violated the Truth in Lending Act and Regulation Z by failing to send acknowledgement notices and resolution letters within the required periods; making adverse reports to consumer reporting agencies regarding amounts disputed in billing error notices prior to completing the requirements for billing error resolution; failing to conduct reasonable investigations for disputes that qualified as billing error notices; and holding consumers liable for amounts at issue in claims of unauthorized use before conducting a reasonable investigation. The Bureau also found that Goldman violated the Consumer Financial Protection Act of 2010 by engaging in unfair acts or practices through its delay in resolving transaction disputes. Separately, in December 2019, Goldman and Apple introduced Apple Card Monthly Installments (ACMI), which allowed Apple Card users to finance the purchase of certain Apple devices directly from Apple through the payment of interest-free monthly installments. The Bureau found that Goldman engaged in deceptive acts or practices by misleading consumers to expect that purchases of Apple devices would automatically be enrolled in ACMI, and by misleading consumers enrolled in ACMI about the application of refunds to Apple Card accounts with both ACMI and non-ACMI balances. The order requires Goldman to pay $19.8 million in redress to consumers and a $45 million civil money penalty and to come into compliance with the law.","[{'text': 'Consent Order', 'link': 'https://files.consumerfinance.gov/f/documents/cfpb_goldman-sachs-bank-usa-consent-order_2024-10.pdf'}, {'text': 'Stipulation', 'link': 'https://files.consumerfinance.gov/f/documents/cfpb_goldman-sachs-bank-usa-stipulation_2024-10.pdf'}, {'text': 'CFPB Orders Apple and Goldman Sachs to Pay Over $89 Million for Apple Card Failures', 'link': '/about-us/newsroom/cfpb-orders-apple-and-goldman-sachs-to-pay-over-89-million-for-apple-card-failures/'}, {'text': 'View case filings', 'link': '/administrative-adjudication-proceedings/administrative-adjudication-docket/goldman-sachs-bank-usa/'}]",https://www.consumerfinance.gov/about-us/newsroom/cfpb-orders-apple-and-goldman-sachs-to-pay-over-89-million-for-apple-card-failures/,https://www.consumerfinance.gov/administrative-adjudication-proceedings/administrative-adjudication-docket/goldman-sachs-bank-usa/,['Administrative Proceeding'],2024-CFPB-0011,"OCT 23, 2024",Post Order/Post Judgment,"['Credit Cards', 'Furnishing']"

The Bureau alleges these entities (the Climb Enterprise) worked together in online student lending for short-term vocational programs at schools with whom Climb Credit, Inc. has partnered. The Bureau further alleges that, through numerous statements since at least 2017, the Climb Enterprise assured consumers that if a Climb loan was available to fund tuition for a school’s educational program, the consumer could trust that the Climb Enterprise had vetted the quality of that program and school. The Climb Enterprise positioned Climb Credit, Inc. as a trusted intermediary by presenting it as a company that prospective borrowers could rely upon to act in their interests by identifying quality educational programs and schools. In fact, however, as the Bureau alleges, the Climb Enterprise offered loans for many programs and schools that it had not vetted for quality. This practice sought to maximize the Climb Enterprise’s revenue by inducing consumers to take out loans without regard to the actual quality of the programs offered. The Bureau asserts the Climb Enterprise violated the Consumer Financial Protection Act of 2010 (CFPA) by engaging in abusive acts and practices in taking unreasonable advantage of consumers’ reliance on the Climb Enterprise’s representations as to the programs and schools; violated the CFPA through deceptive acts and practices regarding the Climb Enterprise’s vetting of schools and the outcomes for consumers who attended the schools; violated the Truth in Lending Act (TILA) and Regulation Z by failing to disclose finance charges on loan documents and annual percentage rates on advertisements; violated TILA and Regulation Z by using the names, emblems, or logos of certain schools to imply that they endorsed Climb loans; and violated the CFPA by committing acts or practices in violation of TILA and Regulation Z. The Bureau seeks, among other things, injunctive relief to prevent future violations and monetary relief in the form of redress to consumers and the imposition of civil money penalties.","[{'text': 'Complaint', 'link': 'https://files.consumerfinance.gov/f/documents/cfpb_climb-credit-complaint_2024-10.pdf'}, {'text': 'CFPB Sues Student Lender Climb Credit and Investment Firm 1/0 for Deceiving Borrowers About Coding Bootcamps and Vocational Programs', 'link': '/about-us/newsroom/cfpb-sues-student-lender-climb-credit-and-investment-firm-1-0-for-deceiving-borrowers-about-coding-bootcamps-and-vocational-programs/'}]",https://www.consumerfinance.gov/about-us/newsroom/cfpb-sues-student-lender-climb-credit-and-investment-firm-1-0-for-deceiving-borrowers-about-coding-bootcamps-and-vocational-programs/,,['Civil Action'],1:24-cv-07868,"OCT 17, 2024",Pending Litigation,['Student Loan Origination']

Fairway is incorporated in Texas and headquartered in Madison, Wisconsin. Fairway acquired mortgage company, MortgageBanc, in 2009, and since 2009, Fairway has operated in the Birmingham-Hoover, AL Metropolitan Statistical Area (Birmingham MSA) under the trade name MortgageBanc. The Bureau’s and DOJ’s joint complaint alleges that Fairway engaged in unlawful discrimination against applicants and prospective applicants, including by redlining majority-Black and high-Black areas in the Birmingham MSA and engaging in acts and practices directed at applicants and prospective applicants that would discourage a reasonable person from making or pursuing an application for credit on the basis of race or color in violation of the Equal Credit Opportunity Act, Regulation B, and the Consumer Financial Protection Act of 2010. DOJ also alleges that Fairway’s conduct violated the Fair Housing Act. If entered by the court, the proposed consent order would require Fairway to invest $7 million in a loan subsidy program under which Fairway must offer home purchase, refinance, and home improvement loans on a more affordable basis than otherwise available for certain residential properties located in majority-Black neighborhoods in the Birmingham MSA. Fairway must also open or acquire a new loan production office or full-service retail office in a majority-Black neighborhood in the Birmingham MSA. Fairway must also spend at least $500,000 on advertising and outreach, at least $250,000 on consumer education, at least $250,000 on partnerships with one or more community-based or governmental organizations, and take other remedial steps, to serve the credit needs of majority-Black neighborhoods in the Birmingham MSA.

"Ejudicate, Inc., d/b/a Brief",https://www.consumerfinance.gov/enforcement/actions/ejudicate-inc-dba-brief/,2024-10-10T00:00:00,"On October 10, 2024, the Bureau issued an order against Ejudicate, Inc., d/b/a Brief, a company based in Los Angeles, California.","On October 10, 2024, the Bureau issued an order against Ejudicate, Inc., d/b/a Brief, a company based in Los Angeles, California. Ejudicate is a private arbitration company that offers an online dispute resolution platform. In April 2022, Ejudicate commenced arbitration proceedings against consumers who had not agreed to be subjected to Ejudicate’s authority. These arbitration proceedings related to consumers’ alleged default on income share loans that had been extended by Prehired, LLC (Prehired), which operated an online training program. Prehired was the subject of a separate Bureaulaw enforcement action. The Bureau found that Ejudicate engaged in unfair acts and practices in violation of the Consumer Financial Protection Act of 2010 (CFPA) by commencing arbitration proceedings without consumers’ consent. In fact, Ejudicate knew it did not have jurisdiction over Prehired’s claims because none of the income share loans contained an arbitration clause permitting arbitration by Ejudicate. The Bureau also found that Ejudicate committed deceptive acts and practices in violation of the CFPA by misrepresenting Ejudicate’s neutrality, the nature of the arbitration proceedings, and the consequences of consumers’ actions or inactions in the Ejudicate forum. For example, Ejudicate falsely represented itself as a neutral and impartial forum for consumer debt arbitrations and failed to disclose that Ejudicate had financial interests aligned with the creditor, Prehired, which filed the claim against the consumer. Finally, the Bureau found that Ejudicate engaged in unfair acts and practices in violation of the CFPA by unlawfully attempting to bind consumers to Ejudicate’s terms of service and platform rules, which infringed on consumers’ ability to defend themselves against the claims lodged against them. The order permanently bans Ejudicate from arbitrating disputes that concern a consumer financial product or service. The order also prohibits Ejudicate from making misrepresentations to consumers in connection with any consumer financial product or service. Ejudicate must pay a civil money penalty of $1, an amount that accounts for Ejudicate’s inability to pay more based on sworn financial statements that it provided to the Bureau.","[{'text': 'Consent Order', 'link': 'https://files.consumerfinance.gov/f/documents/cfpb_ejudicate-inc-consent-order_2024-10.pdf'}, {'text': 'Stipulation', 'link': 'https://files.consumerfinance.gov/f/documents/cfpb_ejudicate-inc-stipulation_2024-10.pdf'}, {'text': 'CFPB Takes Action Against Arbitration Platform Ejudicate for Deceiving Student Borrowers', 'link': '/about-us/newsroom/cfpb-takes-action-against-arbitration-platform-ejudicate-for-deceiving-student-borrowers/'}, {'text': 'View case filings', 'link': '/administrative-adjudication-proceedings/administrative-adjudication-docket/ejudicate-inc-dba-brief/'}]",https://www.consumerfinance.gov/about-us/newsroom/cfpb-takes-action-against-arbitration-platform-ejudicate-for-deceiving-student-borrowers/,https://www.consumerfinance.gov/administrative-adjudication-proceedings/administrative-adjudication-docket/ejudicate-inc-dba-brief/,['Administrative Proceeding'],2024-CFPB-0010,"OCT 10, 2024",Post Order/Post Judgment,['Debt Collection']

(Reliant), d/b/a Horizon Card Services and Robert Kane, its sole shareholder, owner, and chief executive officer. Reliant offered consumers nationwide enrollment in a program called the Horizon Card Services membership in exchange for periodic fees. The primary product included with the membership was an unsecured, open-end line of credit, typically starting at $500 or $750. Until at least January 2021, Reliant often charged fees of at least 60% of the credit limit by charging consumers around $24.95 a month or $299.40 annually for the membership. Although marketed as a regular credit card, the line of credit could be used only to purchase goods from Reliant’s online store, the Horizon Outlet. The outlet had a limited selection of overpriced or off-brand goods. Between 2017 and 2021, only 6% of consumers ever used their cards at the outlet. Despite promises that consumers could obtain a full refund in “less than a minute,” Reliant routinely made consumers endure a series of offers before canceling and refused to provide full refunds unless consumers threatened to seek relief from their bank or the Better Business Bureau. The Bureau alleges that Reliant and Kane engaged in deceptive acts and practices in violation of the Consumer Financial Protection Act of 2010 (CFPA) by marketing the membership as a regular credit card that could be used anywhere that credit cards are accepted, when in fact it was a membership program with a credit card that only could be used to purchase goods from the Horizon Outlet; and for falsely promising that consumers could obtain a full refund in “less than a minute.” The Bureau further alleges that Reliant and Kane engaged in abusive acts and practices in violation of the CFPA by taking unreasonable advantage of customers’ inability to cancel membership enrollment and obtain refunds. The Bureau also alleges that until at least January 2021, Reliant violated the Truth in Lending Act and its implementing regulation, Regulation Z, by unlawfully requiring consumers to pay more than 25% of the credit limit during the first year of account opening. The Bureau seeks, among other things, injunctive relief against Reliant and Kane to prevent future violations and monetary relief in the form of redress to consumers and the imposition of civil money penalties.","[{'text': 'Complaint', 'link': 'https://files.consumerfinance.gov/f/documents/cfpb_cfpb-v-reliant-holdings-credit-cards-horizon_2024-09.pdf'}, {'text': 'CFPB Sues Horizon Card Services and CEO Robert Kane for Illegally Baiting, Gouging, and Trapping Families in High-Fee Credit Cards', 'link': '/about-us/newsroom/cfpb-sues-horizon-card-services-and-ceo-robert-kane-for-illegally-baiting-gouging-and-trapping-families-in-high-fee-credit-cards/'}]",https://www.consumerfinance.gov/about-us/newsroom/cfpb-sues-horizon-card-services-and-ceo-robert-kane-for-illegally-baiting-gouging-and-trapping-families-in-high-fee-credit-cards/,,['Civil Action'],2:24-cv-01301,"SEP 13, 2024",Pending Litigation,['Credit Cards']

TD Bank furnishes credit information on consumer credit card accounts by sending monthly data files to consumer reporting agencies. TD Bank also furnishes consumer deposit account information to nationwide specialty consumer reporting agencies. The Bureau found that over several years TD Bank repeatedly furnished to consumer reporting agencies information containing numerous systemic errors and that it knew of many of these inaccuracies for a year or more before fixing them. In addition, the Bureau found that, for years, TD Bank failed to conduct reasonable and timely investigations of consumer disputes, including sometimes by not conducting any investigation at all. When TD Bank furnished inaccurate consumer information, it may have negatively affected consumers’ access to credit. Specifically, the Bureau found that with respect to its credit card accounts, TD Bank violated the Fair Credit Reporting Act (FCRA) and its implementing regulation, Regulation V, by failing to promptly correct and update information it furnished to consumer reporting agencies that it determined was not complete or accurate; failing to accurately report consumers’ participation in COVID-19 accommodations programs pursuant to the CARES Act; failing to provide the FCRA-required date of first delinquency on certain delinquent or charged-off accounts; failing to conduct reasonable and timely investigations of consumer disputes, including sometimes by not conducting any investigation at all; failing to properly notify consumers when deeming a dispute frivolous or irrelevant; and failing to establish and implement reasonable written policies and procedures regarding the information furnished to consumer reporting agencies. The Bureau also found that TD Bank’s failure to investigate consumer disputes and decision to divert resources away from investigating disputes took unreasonable advantage of the inability of consumers to protect their interest in accurate consumer reporting and was therefore abusive in violation of the Consumer Financial Protection Act of 2010. The Bureau further found that TD Bank violated FCRA and Regulation V with respect to consumer deposit accounts by failing to sufficiently maintain and implement written policies and procedures for furnishing and by failing to promptly correct furnished information after it determined the furnished information was fraudulent.

Since at least 2015, NewDay USA has provided cash-out refinance loans to consumers, including veterans and active-duty members, many of whom had lower than average credit scores and carry consumer debt. Certain states in which NewDay USA offered its cash-out refinances required lenders to complete a borrower “net benefit” analysis worksheet showing the financial benefit of a refinance to a borrower. The Bureau found that NewDay USA engaged in deceptive acts and practices in violation of the Consumer Financial Protection Act of 2010 by consistently misstating in the net benefit worksheets provided to borrowers in North Carolina and Maine up through 2020, and Minnesota up through 2018, how borrowers’ “previous” monthly mortgage payment would compare to the “new” monthly mortgage payment after refinancing with NewDay USA.

On June 7, 2017, the Bureaupreviously issued an orderagainst Fay Servicing to address the Bureau’s findings that Fay Servicing failed to provide mortgage borrowers with the protections against foreclosure required by law, kept borrowers in the dark about critical information about the process for applying for foreclosure relief, and moved forward with the foreclosure process while borrowers were actively seeking help to save their homes. In this action, the Bureau found that Fay Servicing violated the Bureau’s 2017 order, Regulation X, which implements the Real Estate Settlement Procedures Act, and the Consumer Financial Protection Act of 2010 (CFPA) by, among other things, taking prohibited foreclosure actions against borrowers engaged in loss mitigation and preventing borrowers from taking advantage of all loss mitigation options available to them. Specifically, the Bureau found that Fay Servicing failed to implement the 2017 Order’s requirements, including ensuring that it did not engage in prohibited foreclosure activity; properly maintaining data about borrowers’ loss mitigation applications; and developing written policies and procedures to ensure compliance. The Bureau also found that Fay Servicing engaged in additional violations of Regulation X by engaging in prohibited foreclosure activity against borrowers entitled to foreclosure protections and failing to maintain adequate policies and procedures. The Bureau also found that Fay Servicing engaged in unfair practices by failing to inform borrowers how their indicated preference for retention or non-retention options, or lack thereof, could limit available loss mitigation options. Finally, the Bureau found that Fay Servicing violated multiple provisions of the Homeowners Protection Act, Regulation X, Regulation Z (which implements the Truth in Lending Act), and the CFPA’s prohibition on unfair and deceptive practices in its administration of private mortgage insurance and assessment of late fees. The order requires Fay Servicing to stop its illegal practices and improve its servicing technology and compliance management systems. The order also puts limitations on compensation to Edward Fay, Fay Servicing’s founder, CEO, and Chairman of the Board, if Edward Fay does not take actions necessary to ensure compliance with the order. The order also requires Fay Servicing to pay $3 million in consumer redress, a $2 million civil money penalty, and to invest $2 million to update its servicing technology and compliance management systems.","[{'text': 'Consent Order', 'link': 'https://files.consumerfinance.gov/f/documents/cfpb_fay-servicing-consent-order_2024-08.pdf'}, {'text': 'Stipulation', 'link': 'https://files.consumerfinance.gov/f/documents/cfpb_fay-servicing-stipulation_2024-08.pdf'}, {'text': 'CFPB Takes Action Against Fay Servicing for Illegal Foreclosure Actions and Violating Law Enforcement Order', 'link': '/about-us/newsroom/cfpb-takes-action-against-fay-servicing-for-illegal-foreclosure-actions-and-violating-law-enforcement-order/'}, {'text': 'View case filings', 'link': '/administrative-adjudication-proceedings/administrative-adjudication-docket/fay-servicing-llc-2024/'}]",https://www.consumerfinance.gov/about-us/newsroom/cfpb-takes-action-against-fay-servicing-for-illegal-foreclosure-actions-and-violating-law-enforcement-order/,https://www.consumerfinance.gov/administrative-adjudication-proceedings/administrative-adjudication-docket/fay-servicing-llc-2024/,['Administrative Proceeding'],2024-CFPB-0007,"AUG 21, 2024",Post Order/Post Judgment,['Mortgage Servicing']

Acima purports to offer consumers nationwide a means to “lease-to-own” consumer goods at the point of purchase online and in stores. The Bureau alleges that Acima’s purported “leases” were actually credit, and that Acima and Allred violated the Consumer Financial Protection Act’s (CFPA) prohibition against unfair, deceptive, and abusive acts and practices by: misleading consumers regarding the nature and terms of Acima’s agreements, including their exorbitant cost; materially interfering with consumers’ ability to understand the terms and conditions of those agreements; effectively locking consumers into these high-cost financing arrangements by making it difficult for consumers to terminate them and creating unfair barriers to returns; misrepresenting consumers’ ability to return goods and the means by which returns could be accomplished; misrepresenting to consumers that their contracts required the maintenance of “autopay”; and providing deceptive advertisements and training to merchants, that created the likelihood that merchants would misrepresent the terms of Acima’s agreements, mislead consumers about the ease of returns, and create confusion about whether Acima’s product was credit or a lease. The Bureau alleges that Allred was directly involved in and “substantially assisted” Acima’s violations of the CFPA. The Bureau also alleges that Acima violated the Fair Credit Reporting Act (FCRA) and its implementing Regulation V by furnishing inaccurate information about its customers to consumer reporting agencies (CRAs); failing to establish and implement reasonable written policies and procedures regarding the accuracy and integrity of information it furnished to CRAs; failing to conduct reasonable investigations of furnishing disputes; and failing to notify consumers when it reported negative information about them to CRAs. The Bureau also alleges that Acima violated the Truth in Lending Act and its implementing Regulation Z by failing to provide required disclosures to consumers, including the annual percentage rate and finance charges. The Bureau further alleges that Acima violated the Electronic Fund Transfer Act and its implementing Regulation E by conditioning their extension of credit to consumers on repayment by preauthorized electronic fund transfers. Finally, the Bureau alleges in the alternative that, if Acima did not extend credit to consumers, Acima and Allred misrepresented that Acima’s agreements were credit and violated FCRA by using and obtaining consumer reports without a permissible purpose or consumer authorization. The Bureau seeks, among other things, injunctive relief against Acima and Allred to prevent future violations and monetary relief in the form of redress to consumers and the imposition of civil money penalties.","[{'text': 'Complaint', 'link': 'https://files.consumerfinance.gov/f/documents/cfpb_acima-complaint_2024-07.pdf'}, {'text': 'CFPB Sues Rent-a-Center Affiliate Acima and Acima’s Founder Aaron Allred for Illegal Lending Practices', 'link': '/about-us/newsroom/cfpb-sues-acima-for-trapping-consumers-in-high-cost-credit-agreements/'}]",https://www.consumerfinance.gov/about-us/newsroom/cfpb-sues-acima-for-trapping-consumers-in-high-cost-credit-agreements/,,['Civil Action'],2:24-cv-00525,"JUL 26, 2024",Pending Litigation,"['Furnishing', 'Other Consumer Lending', 'Other Consumer Product (not lending)', 'Short Term, Small Dollar']"

(Fifth Third), a national bank that, among other things, offers and services motor vehicle loans to consumers directly and through a variety of vehicle dealers. Typically, when borrowers obtained a loan from Fifth Third, borrowers signed agreements that required them to maintain insurance that would cover physical damage to the vehicle that served as collateral for the loan. If borrowers did not maintain that insurance coverage, Fifth Third could force-place physical-damage coverage on the vehicle, otherwise known as force-placed insurance. Over 50% of the policies Fifth Third force placed were charged to borrowers who had either always maintained their own insurance or obtained the requisite insurance within a 30-day timeframe of their prior policy lapsing. The Bureau found that Fifth Third’s placing duplicative and unnecessary force-placed insurance on motor vehicle loans; charging premiums for force-placed-insurance policies that had terminated; and failing to provide sufficient notice to consumers of increased monthly payments due to force-placed insurance was unfair in violation of the Consumer Financial Protection Act of 2010 (CFPA). Despite the high number of unnecessary and duplicative force-placed insurance policies and its deficient notice and cancellation processes, Fifth Third continued to force place insurance for years, demanding that consumers pay for insurance they did not need or else face delinquency, additional fees, and even repossession. From 2011 through 2019, Fifth Third force-placed or maintained unnecessary duplicative insurance over 37,000 times. The Bureau also found that Fifth Third made deceptive representations to borrowers about the time required to cancel force-placed-insurance policies and about the total amount due in right-to-cure letters, subjecting borrowers to delinquency-related fees. The Bureau further found that Fifth Third violated the Fair Credit Reporting Act by furnishing inaccurate information to consumer reporting agencies regarding repossessions. Finally, the Bureau found that Fifth Third failed to notify consumers of increases in the amounts of preauthorized electronic-fund transfers due to force-placed insurance, in violation of the Electronic Fund Transfer Act and Regulation E. The order requires Fifth Third to come into compliance with the law, pay redress, and pay a $5 million civil money penalty.","[{'text': 'Consent Order', 'link': 'https://files.consumerfinance.gov/f/documents/cfpb_fifth-third-bank-na-consent-order_2024-07.pdf'}, {'text': 'Stipulation', 'link': 'https://files.consumerfinance.gov/f/documents/cfpb_fifth-third-bank-na-stipulation_2024-07.pdf'}, {'text': 'CFPB Takes Action Against Fifth Third for Wrongfully Triggering Auto Repossessions and Opening Fake Bank Accounts', 'link': '/about-us/newsroom/cfpb-takes-action-against-fifth-third-for-wrongfully-triggering-auto-repossessions-and-opening-fake-bank-accounts/'}, {'text': 'View case filings', 'link': '/administrative-adjudication-proceedings/administrative-adjudication-docket/fifth-third-bank-na-fpi-2024/'}]",https://www.consumerfinance.gov/about-us/newsroom/cfpb-takes-action-against-fifth-third-for-wrongfully-triggering-auto-repossessions-and-opening-fake-bank-accounts/,,['Administrative Proceeding'],2024-CFPB-0006,"JUL 09, 2024",Post Order/Post Judgment,['Auto Finance Servicing']

NOVAD was responsible for servicing up to 150,000 reverse mortgage loans each year from September 2014 through 2022. The Bureau found that NOVAD sent borrowers repayment or “due and payable” letters that often falsely conveyed that their loans were in default and that the full amount of their loan was due. The Bureau also found that NOVAD failed to effectively service borrowers’ reverse mortgages, including by routinely failing to acknowledge, timely respond to, and substantively respond to borrowers’ time-sensitive information requests and error notices; failing to acknowledge, investigate, and correct servicing errors; and failing to engage in two-way communications with borrowers, including after sending repayment letters to borrowers. NOVAD’s conduct resulted in borrowers losing out on home sales, paying unnecessary costs, and fearing foreclosure.

The Bureau alleges that AES fails to recognize that some private student loans are discharged in bankruptcy and lacks policies and procedures to identify which private loans it services have been discharged by a bankruptcy court’s order of discharge. As a result, AES treats certain private student loans that were discharged as though the consumer still owes those debts such that consumers pay thousands of dollars they did not owe. The Bureau alleges that by failing to maintain policies and procedures to determine whether the education loans it services are discharged in bankruptcy and collecting and furnishing on discharged debts, AES has engaged in unfair, deceptive, and abusive acts or practices in violation of the Consumer Financial Act of 2010.

(SoLo), a fintech company that operates a nationwide website and mobile-application based peer-to-peer lending platform through which consumers can obtain small-dollar, short-term loans. SoLo markets its lending platform to consumers as a consumer-friendly alternative to high-cost, short-term loans. According to SoLo’s website, the SoLo Platform has disbursed over a million loans since 2018. The Bureau alleges that SoLo’s advertisements and loan disclosures tout no-interest loans when, in fact, virtually all loans on the SoLo Platform include a lender “tip” that goes to the lender, a SoLo “donation” that goes to SoLo, or both. The Bureau alleges that SoLo also misrepresented key terms about the total cost of credit in its promissory notes and disclosures. The Bureau also alleges that SoLo materially interfered with consumers’ ability to understand what fees they were required to pay by obscuring consumer’s ability to opt out of a SoLo “donation.” Further, the Bureau alleges that SoLo engaged in unfair, deceptive, and abusive conduct by servicing and collecting on loans that are void and uncollectible because they were either made without a required state license or in excess of state usury caps in the state where the borrower resides. When collecting on debt, the Bureau alleges that SoLo has also misrepresented to consumers that it will furnish negative information to credit bureaus when, in fact, it never did. The Bureau alleges this conduct violated the Consumer Financial Protection Act of 2010 (CFPA). The Bureau further alleges that SoLo violated the Fair Credit Reporting Act by not implementing reasonable procedures to assure the maximum possible accuracy of its proprietary credit score, “SoLo Score,” which it provided to lenders to evaluate prospective borrowers, as well as information regarding the number of loans a borrower repaid.

The Bureau found that Chime failed to refund consumers’ balances within 14 days in thousands of instances, including thousands of instances when Chime failed to issue consumer refunds within 90 days. Consumers who do not have access to funds in their bank accounts often are unable to pay for basic living expenses, like groceries, gas, and housing. To meet these needs, consumers likely have to use or search for alternate sources of funds, such as credit cards and payday loans, which can be expensive.

If entered by the court, the stipulated final judgments will require the Trusts and PHEAA to pay $400,000 and $1.75 million in civil money penalties, respectively, and pay nearly $3 million in redress to affected consumers.

Under the agreements, students could attend BloomTech if they agreed to pay the school a percentage of their monthly income from a qualifying job with an income of at least $50,000 after they graduate. Nearly all BloomTech’s students funded their enrollment in its programs with such agreements. The Bureau found that BloomTech and Allred made false representations about the income share agreements and the benefits students would receive if they entered them, including that the agreements were not loans and carried no finance charge, that the school’s interests were aligned with its students’ interests because the school got paid only when students got a high-enough paying job, and that the school had high job-placement rates and a top-notch curriculum and instructors. The Bureau found that BloomTech and Allred violated the Consumer Financial Protection Act of 2010’s prohibition of deceptive and abusive acts or practices with its deceptive statements and by taking unreasonable advantage of consumers’ reasonable reliance on BloomTech to act in their interests. The Bureau also found that BloomTech violated the Truth in Lending Act and its implementing regulation, Regulation Z, by failing to disclose key facts about its financing agreements, such as the amount financed, finance charge, and annual percentage rate; and that BloomTech violated the Holder Rule by failing to include a provision in its financing agreements making any holder of the agreement subject to the legal claims that students could assert against BloomTech. The Bureau’s order permanently bans BloomTech from all consumer-lending activities and bans Allred from any student-lending activities for ten years. It also rescinds income share agreements for graduates who have not had a qualifying job in the past year; reforms income share agreements to eliminate the finance charge for consumers who graduated the program more than 18 months ago and obtained a qualifying job making $70,000 or less; and gives current students the option to withdraw from the program and cancel their income share agreement or continue in the program with a third-party loan or lawful income share agreement. The order also requires that BloomTech and Allred pay civil money penalties of $64,235 and $100,000, respectively.","[{'text': 'Consent Order', 'link': 'https://files.consumerfinance.gov/f/documents/cfpb_bloomtech-inc-consent-order_2024-04.pdf'}, {'text': 'Stipulation', 'link': 'https://files.consumerfinance.gov/f/documents/cfpb_bloomtech-inc-stipulation_2024-04.pdf'}, {'text': 'CFPB Takes Action Against Coding Boot Camp BloomTech and CEO Austen Allred for Deceiving Students and Hiding Loan Costs', 'link': '/about-us/newsroom/cfpb-sues-coding-boot-camp-bloomtech-and-ceo-austen-allred-for-deceiving-students-and-hiding-loan-costs/'}, {'text': 'View case filings', 'link': '/administrative-adjudication-proceedings/administrative-adjudication-docket/bloom-institute-of-technology/'}]",https://www.consumerfinance.gov/about-us/newsroom/cfpb-sues-coding-boot-camp-bloomtech-and-ceo-austen-allred-for-deceiving-students-and-hiding-loan-costs/,https://www.consumerfinance.gov/administrative-adjudication-proceedings/administrative-adjudication-docket/bloom-institute-of-technology/,['Administrative Proceeding'],2024-CFPB-0001,"APR 17, 2024",Post Order/Post Judgment,['Student Loan Origination']

The complaint also named the following relief defendants: Strategic ESOP; Strategic ESOT; The Blust Family Irrevocable Trust through Donald J. Holmgren, Trustee; Jaclyn Blust; Lit Def Strategies, LLC; and Relialit, LLC. SFS is a debt-relief company with offices in Buffalo and Manhattan, New York. In the First Amended Complaint filed on March 27, 2024, the Bureau alleges that since at least January 2016, SFS and the individual defendants have operated a debt-relief scheme that collects exorbitant, illegal advance fees from vulnerable consumers suffering financial difficulties through a web of interrelated companies they have created, including law firms, that serve as a facade for SFS’s debt-relief operation. The Telemarketing Sales Rule (TSR) prohibits charging and collecting fees before renegotiating the terms of at least one debt and before a payment is made under the renegotiated terms, as well as charging fee amounts that are not tied to the percentage of the enrolled debt settled or reduced or the amount saved. The TSR also prohibits making a false or misleading statement to induce any person to pay for goods or services as well as misrepresenting any material aspects of debt relief services. The Bureau alleges that the defendants violated, and substantially assisted violations of, these prohibitions. Specifically, under SFS’s direction, the web of companies induce consumers to sign up for debt-relief services using a bait and switch scheme that draws consumers in by offering a debt consolidation loan. Once consumers call SFS to inquire about the loan, SFS representatives push them towards purchasing debt relief services, which they misleadingly describe as the “0% interest” option. After making the sale, SFS begins debiting fees for the debt-relief services from consumers’ escrow accounts long before any of the consumers’ debts have been settled, and the fee amounts the companies collect are pre-determined and do not depend on any results the companies might obtain. As alleged in the complaint, since January 2016, defendants have collected at least $100,000,000 from consumers before any of the consumers’ debts were settled, and in some instances when no such settlements ever took place. The complaint seeks permanent and preliminary injunctive relief, redress for consumers, and a civil money penalty. On January 11, 2024 and March 4, 2024, the court granted the Bureau’s request for a temporary restraining order and preliminary injunction, respectively.","[{'text': 'Complaint', 'link': 'https://files.consumerfinance.gov/f/documents/cfpb_complaint-stratfs_2024-01.pdf'}, {'text': 'First Amended Complaint', 'link': 'https://files.consumerfinance.gov/f/documents/cfpb_first-amended-complaint-stratfs_2024-03.pdf'}, {'text': 'CFPB and Seven State Attorneys General Sue Debt-Relief Enterprise, Strategic Financial Solutions, for Illegally Swindling More Than $100 Million from Financially Struggling Families', 'link': '/about-us/newsroom/cfpb-and-seven-state-attorneys-general-sue-debt-relief-enterprise-strategic-financial-solutions-for-illegally-swindling-more-than-100-million-from-financially-struggling-families/'}]",https://www.consumerfinance.gov/about-us/newsroom/cfpb-and-seven-state-attorneys-general-sue-debt-relief-enterprise-strategic-financial-solutions-for-illegally-swindling-more-than-100-million-from-financially-struggling-families/,,['Civil Action'],1:24-cv-00040,"JAN 10, 2024",Pending Litigation,['Debt Relief']

U.S. Bank has offered prepaid debit cards to eligible consumers in at least 19 states and the District of Columbia to distribute unemployment insurance benefits through its ReliaCard program. In the summer of 2020, U.S. Bank implemented new freeze criteria to determine whether to freeze a card due to suspected fraud. Using these new fraud controls and its expanded criteria used for freezing accounts, U.S. Bank froze the accounts of tens of thousands of cardholders eligible for benefits. The Bureau found that U.S. Bank engaged in unfair acts or practices in violation of the Consumer Financial Protection Act of 2010 by failing to provide those eligible ReliaCard prepaid debit cardholders whose accounts U.S. Bank froze with adequate means to verify their identities and timely regain access to their benefits. For freezes that U.S. Bank imposed in August 2020 through November 2020, on average it took a month or longer for consumers to unfreeze their ReliaCard accounts. And for freezes that U.S. Bank imposed in December 2020 through March 2021, on average it took multiple weeks for consumers to unfreeze their ReliaCard accounts. The Bureau also found that U.S. Bank violated the Electronic Fund Transfer Act, and its implementing Regulation E, by failing to timely investigate ReliaCard prepaid debit cardholders’ notices of error concerning alleged unauthorized electronic fund transfers (EFTs). The order requires U.S. Bank to provide $5.7 million in redress to consumers and to pay a $15 million civil money penalty. The order also requires U.S. Bank to take measures to ensure future compliance.

The Bureau also found that Commonwealth violated the Fair Debt Collection Practices Act by sending debt collection letters to consumers before providing the consumer a verification of the debt when Commonwealth had received a written dispute from the consumer within 30 days of the consumer’s receipt of a debt validation notice; misrepresenting to consumers that they owed alleged debts in certain circumstances when Commonwealth lacked a reasonable basis to make those representations; and communicating credit information about alleged debts to CRAs but failing to communicate that the debts were disputed.

The bank must also provide the consumer with a written notice describing the overdraft service before it can obtain that consumer’s consent. The Bureau found that the bank violated Regulation E because, as part of its in-branch, checking account-opening process, its employees requested that new customers orally provide their enrollment decision before providing them with an adequate written notice describing the overdraft service. The Bureau also found that Atlantic Union Bank engaged in unlawful deception in violation of the Consumer Financial Protection Act of 2010 by misleading consumers who called in by phone and enrolled in its Opt-In Overdraft Privilege service; the bank misrepresented which transactions the service covered and omitted material information about the terms and conditions of the service.

Toyota Motor Credit provides financing for vehicles and optional “add-on” products and services sold with the vehicles. These add-ons include Guaranteed Asset Protection (GAP), which waives some of a consumer’s remaining loan balance if their car is totaled but they still owe money on the loan even with car insurance, and Credit Life and Accidental Health (CLAH), which is designed to pay a remaining balance if the consumer dies or becomes disabled. The Bureau found that Toyota Motor Credit violated the Consumer Financial Protection Act of 2010 by: (1) unfairly and abusively making it unreasonably difficult for consumers to cancel unwanted add-ons, including when consumers complained that dealers had forced add-ons on consumers without their consent; (2) unfairly failing to ensure consumers received refunds of unearned GAP and CLAH premiums when they paid off their loans early or ended lease agreements early, making the products no longer of any value to consumers; and (3) unfairly failing to provide accurate refunds to consumers who canceled their vehicle service agreements as a result of flawed system logic. The Bureau also found that Toyota Motor Credit violated the Fair Credit Reporting Act and its implementing Regulation V by falsely reporting customer accounts as delinquent even though customers had already returned their vehicles and failing to promptly correct the negative information it had sent to consumer reporting agencies; and failing to maintain reasonable policies and procedures to ensure payment information it sent to consumer reporting agencies was accurate. The order requires Toyota Motor Credit to pay $48 million in consumer redress and a $12 million civil money penalty.

The 2019 order, among other requirements, barred Enova from making or initiating electronic fund transfers without valid authorization and from failing to honor loan extensions. The Bureau found that Enova violated the 2019 Order, and therefore the CFPA, by debiting or attempting to debit consumers’ bank accounts in a wide array of circumstances without the consumer’s express informed consent; failing to honor loan extensions it had granted to consumers; debiting the full loan payment instead of a loan extension fee on loans for which Enova had granted a loan extension; and making or initiating electronic fund transfers from consumers’ bank accounts on a recurring basis without valid authorization identifying the particular bank account the consumer had authorized for EFTs and providing a copy of that authorization to the consumer. The Bureau also found that Enova violated the CFPA’s prohibition on unfair acts and practices by debiting or attempting to debit consumers’ accounts without their authorization and by canceling previously-granted loan extensions and debiting such consumers’ bank accounts for the full loan payment instead of a loan extension fee. The Bureau further found that Enova violated the CFPA’s prohibition on deceptive acts or practices by failing to tell consumers who had been granted a loan extension that making an interim partial payment would result in cancellation of the loan extension, misrepresenting the amount that Enova would charge consumers who made such an interim partial payment, misrepresenting the due date for certain loan payments, misrepresenting that consumers could skip certain loan payments, and misrepresenting the amounts due on certain consumer loans.

Security freezes and locks block certain third parties, such as lenders, from accessing consumers’ credit reports to prevent a potential identity thief from obtaining new credit in those consumers’ names. Consumers can remove or lift security freezes upon request to, for example, apply for credit. Starting in September 2018, Federal law has required nationwide consumer reporting agencies to provide security freezes as a free service, whereas locks are a feature of certain paid products. The Bureau found that TransUnion, from as early as 2003, failed to timely place or remove security freezes and locks on the credit reports of tens of thousands of consumers who requested them, including certain vulnerable consumers; in some cases, those requests were left unmet for months or years. The Bureau found TransUnion’s failure to place or remove security freezes in a timely manner occurred as a result of problems, including systems issues, that TransUnion knew about but failed to address for years. The Bureau found that TransUnion’s failure to place or remove security freezes in a timely manner violated the Fair Credit Reporting Act (FCRA), and TransUnion’s failure to place or remove both security freezes and locks in a timely manner was unfair in violation of the Consumer Financial Protection Act of 2010 (CFPA).

Tempoe purchased personal property and services from retailers and then leased them to consumers. Typically, consumers were offered Tempoe’s product after applying and being rejected for conventional financing through the retailer. Under the terms of Tempoe’s agreements, consumers made periodic payments for an initial term of five months. Then, unless the consumer made an active selection to purchase or return the property, Tempoe continued auto-debiting the consumers for the full month-to-month term of the contract, typically 18 to 36 months. Some consumers discovered only at the conclusion of their initial term that they did not own their items and were required to pay more. The Bureau found that Tempoe engaged in unfair acts and practices in violation of the Consumer Financial Protection Act of 2010 by (1) failing to ensure that consumers had access to the terms of the transaction, and (2) prohibiting the return of some goods and services. The Bureau also found that Tempoe violated Regulation M, which implements the Consumer Leasing Act, by failing to provide consumers with required disclosures for leases that extended beyond the initial term by six months or more. The order permanently bans Tempoe from offering or providing consumer leases and requires Tempoe to release all consumers with existing lease agreements from their leases and to allow them to maintain the leased products with no further financial obligation; this includes approximately 19,300 leases with an aggregate value of approximately $33 million. The order also requires Tempoe to pay a $2 million civil money penalty, of which $1 million will be remitted upon Tempoe’s payment of that amount to the states that filed a parallel multi-state settlement addressing the same conduct.",[],,,['Administrative Proceeding'],2023-CFPB-0010,"SEP 11, 2023",Post Order/Post Judgment,"['Short Term, Small Dollar']"

The Bureau alleges that Southern employs numerous harmful underwriting, sales, and servicing practices for their refinanced loans that are designed to churn delinquent borrowers into continuous fee-laden debt; these fee-laden refinances erode the borrowers’ available credit and increase their total cost of borrowing with each successive refinance. The Bureau further alleges that Southern has generated hundreds of millions in loan costs and fees and that it derives 40% of its net revenue through this process of “churning” borrowers in repeated, fee-laden refinances. The Bureau alleges that Southern’s loan-churning practices violate the Consumer Financial Protection Act of 2010 because they are unfair; they are abusive because they take unreasonable advantage of borrowers’ lack of understanding of the material risks, costs, or conditions of a refinanced Southern loan; and they are abusive because they take unreasonable advantage of payment-stressed borrowers’ inability to protect their interests in the selection or use of a refinanced loan.

Prehired has its principal place of business in Delaware and, prior to filing bankruptcy, operated a private, for-profit vocational training program for software sales representatives. Prehired charged up to $30,000 for its program and encouraged consumers who could not pay upfront to enter into income share loans. Prehired’s income share loans required consumers to make minimum payments equal to between 12.5% and 16% of their gross income for 4 to 8 years or until they had paid a total of $30,000, whichever was sooner. Prehired transferred ownership of many of these loans to other entities, including Prehired Recruiting and Prehired Accelerator. The complaint alleged that Prehired deceptively represented that its income share loans were not loans; deceptively represented that consumers would pay nothing until they had a job making at least $60,000 a year; and failed to disclose key financing terms required by the Truth in Lending Act (TILA) and Regulation Z. The complaint also alleged that Prehired Recruiting engaged in unfair acts and practices by filing debt collection lawsuits in a distant forum when consumers neither lived in that forum nor were in that forum when they executed the financing agreement. The complaint further alleged that Prehired Recruiting and Prehired Accelerator violated the Fair Debt Collection Practices Act (FDCPA) and the Consumer Financial Protection Act of 2010 (CFPA) by deceptively inducing consumers to enter into settlement agreements, and the FDCPA by claiming the consumers owed more than they did.

When a consumer writes a check or authorizes an ACH transaction to a merchant or other payee using their deposit account at Bank of America, the merchant or other payee may then present that check or ACH authorization to the bank for payment. Until February 2022, if a consumer did not have sufficient funds in their account to pay for the transaction and the bank decided not to pay it, Bank of America assessed the consumer a $35 non-sufficient funds fee. Merchants commonly “re-present” these returned transactions—that is, they again try to receive payment—often multiple times. For many years, Bank of America assessed non-sufficient fund fees on ACH and check transactions that it returned unpaid even though it had already assessed a $35 fee for the same ACH or check transaction that it had previously returned unpaid (i.e., repeat non-sufficient fund fees). Bank of America would assess these repeat non-sufficient fund fees potentially as soon as the next day after the initial transaction. From September 2018 until February 2022, Bank of America generated hundreds of millions of dollars in such fees. The Bureau found that Bank of America’s assessment of repeat non-sufficient fund fees was unfair in violation of the Consumer Financial Protection Act of 2010. The Bureau’s order requires Bank of America to refund all repeat non-sufficient fund fees that it collected since September 2018 and has not yet refunded, totaling approximately $80.4 million in redress.

(RMK), a California-based mortgage lender that also does business under the name Majestic Home Loans. RMK, which is licensed as a mortgage broker or lender in at least 30 states, originates consumer mortgages, including mortgages guaranteed by the Department of Veterans Affairs (VA) and mortgages insured by the Federal Housing Administration (FHA). The Bureau previously issued an order against RMK on April 8, 2015 (2015 Order). The Bureau’s 2015 Order was based on the Bureau’s finding that RMK disseminated numerous advertisements for mortgages that contained deceptive representations in violation of the Consumer Financial Protection Act of 2010 (CFPA) and the Mortgage Acts and Practices—Advertising Rule (Regulation N) or failed to include required disclosures in violation of the Truth in Lending Act (TILA) and its implementing regulation, Regulation Z. These included advertisements that RMK sent to U.S. military servicemembers and veterans that used the names and logos of the VA and FHA in a way that falsely implied that the advertisements were sent by the VA or FHA and advertisements that misrepresented the loan’s terms. The 2015 Order required RMK to abide by a series of prohibitions against the types of misrepresentations and other violations the Bureau found in the 2015 Order. The Bureau found that, after the 2015 Consent Order went into effect, RMK disseminated millions of mortgage advertisements that made deceptive representations or contained inadequate or impermissible disclosures in violation of the 2015 Order, as well as the CFPA, Regulation N, and Regulation Z. These included, for example, advertisements that misrepresented that RMK was the VA or the FHA or that RMK was affiliated with the VA or the FHA, advertisements that misrepresented they were sent by the VA or FHA, advertisements that misrepresented that benefits available to those who qualified for VA or FHA loans were time limited, and advertisements that misrepresented the amount of the monthly payments for the advertised loan. Many of these advertisements reflected the same types of deceptive and other unlawful advertising practices that were the subject of the Bureau’s findings in the 2015 Order and expressly prohibited by the 2015 Order. This order permanently bans RMK from the mortgage lending business by permanently prohibiting RMK from engaging in any mortgage lending activities, including advertising, marketing, promoting, offering, providing, originating, administering, servicing, or selling mortgage loans, or otherwise participating in or receiving remuneration from mortgage lending, or assisting others in doing so. The order also requires RMK to pay a $1 million civil money penalty.",[],,,['Administrative Proceeding'],2023-CFPB-0002,"FEB 27, 2023",Post Order/Post Judgment,['Mortgage Origination']

The Military Lending Act (MLA) contains a number of protections for active-duty servicemembers, their spouses, children, and other dependents, defined as “covered borrowers.” Among other protections, the MLA prohibits nonbank creditors from using vehicle titles to secure loans to covered borrowers. The Bureau found that TitleMax violated the MLA by extending thousands of title loans to covered borrowers; extending loans that exceeded the MLA’s 36% Military Annual Percentage Rate (MAPR) cap; failing to make disclosures required under the MLA; extending loans to covered borrowers with MLA-prohibited arbitration clauses; and extending loans to covered borrowers with onerous notice requirements. The Bureau also found that TitleMax engaged in unfair acts or practices in violation of the Consumer Financial Protection Act of 2010 (CFPA) by charging borrowers for an insurance product that provided no coverage on about 15,000 loans. The Bureau further found that in doing so, TitleMax understated the finance charges and annual percentage rates of those loans, violating the Truth in Lending Act and CFPA.

Credit Acceptance is one of the country’s largest publicly traded auto lenders, doing business with a network of more than 12,000 affiliated used-car dealers. The joint complaint alleges that Credit Acceptance pushes dealers to sell cars with hidden interest costs and surreptitiously include expensive add-on products with vehicle sales. The complaint further alleges that Credit Acceptance applies complicated algorithms to predict how much it is likely to collect from borrowers to determine how much to offer dealers for each loan, resulting in high-cost loans—with annual percentage rates (APR) often exceeding state usury caps—made without regard for borrowers’ ability to repay, while still yielding profits for Credit Acceptance. A significant number of Credit Acceptance’s most credit-constrained borrowers become delinquent on their loans within the first year, and many also lose their cars to repossession and auction or suffer other negative effects from the loans. The joint complaint alleges that Credit Acceptance is engaging in deceptive acts or practices in violation of the Consumer Financial Protection Act of 2010 by misrepresenting key loan terms, including the true principal, finance charge, and APR. The joint complaint further alleges that Credit Acceptance is engaging in abusive acts or practices by taking unreasonable advantage of consumers’ lack of understanding of the risk of default and the severity of the consequences associated with its loans, and taking unreasonable advantage of consumers’ inability to protect their interests in selecting or using Credit Acceptance’s loans. The joint complaint also alleges that Credit Acceptance substantially assists dealers in the deceptive sale of add-on products.

The Bureau found that since 2013, UniTeller has engaged in wide-ranging failures to comply with the Electronic Fund Transfer Act (EFTA) and its implementing Regulation E, including Subpart B, known as the Remittance Transfer Rule.

Wells Fargo is the third largest bank in the United States, with nearly $1.8 trillion in assets, and the largest provider of consumer financial products. The Bureau identified multiple violations across several of the bank’s largest consumer product lines, which led to billions of dollars in financial harm and, in thousands of cases, the loss of customers’ vehicles and homes. Specifically, with respect to auto loan servicing Wells Fargo engaged in unfair acts and practices in violation of the Consumer Financial Protection Act of 2010 by incorrectly applying consumer payments; charging borrowers incorrect fees, interest, or other amounts; wrongly repossessing borrowers’ vehicles; and failing to refund consumers who had paid certain fees upfront to automobile dealers when warranted. Wells Fargo also engaged in unfair practices by improperly denying mortgage loan modifications, miscalculating fees and other charges, and assessing unwarranted charges and fees. With respect to deposit accounts, Wells Fargo: unfairly froze multiple consumer accounts in instances of suspected fraud when lesser restraints were available; made deceptive claims as to the availability of waivers of monthly service fees; and unfairly charged overdraft fees even if the consumer had enough funds available in their account to cover the amount of the transaction at the time they made it.

Carrington services a large number of federally backed mortgage loans, which are made or guaranteed by federal agencies or government-sponsored entities (GSEs). In 2020, Congress passed the CARES Act, which provided borrowers with federally backed mortgage loans who were experiencing financial hardship during the COVID-19 emergency with certain assistance, including forbearances of up to 180-days each upon request and protections for credit reporting. The federal agencies and GSEs also issued guidelines to their servicers relating to assistance to borrowers during the pandemic. The Bureau found that Carrington failed to implement a number of those protections through misrepresentations to consumers, including by: representing that borrowers could not have 180 days of forbearance on request or that certain borrowers could not have forbearance at all; representing that consumers had to make more detailed attestations than were actually required by law; representing that late fees for amounts in forbearance would be charged when they were not permitted; and providing incorrect or confusing information about forbearance and repayment options. The Bureau also found that Carrington did not accurately report the status of borrowers on forbearance to consumer reporting agencies (CRAs), and failed to maintain and update its written policies and procedures relating to furnishing to CRAs in connection with the CARES Act. As a result, the Bureau determined that Carrington violated the Consumer Financial Protection Act of 2010’s (CFPA) prohibition on deceptive conduct, as well as certain provisions of the Fair Credit Reporting Act (FCRA) and its implementing regulation, Regulation V. The order requires Carrington to, among other things, conduct an audit to ensure any improperly charged late fees have been refunded to consumers, and if not, to refund them; to assess customer service staffing and provide training relating to applicable CARES Act and agency and GSE guidelines; to establish policies and procedures to prevent the issues from recurring; and to pay a civil money penalty of $5.25 million.",[],,,['Administrative Proceeding'],2022-CFPB-0010,"NOV 17, 2022",Post Order/Post Judgment,['Mortgage Servicing']

ACTIVE provides enrollment and payment processing services to organizers of charity races, youth camps, and other events. The Bureau alleges that ACTIVE engaged in deceptive and abusive acts and practices in violation of the Consumer Financial Protection Act of 2010 (CFPA) by enrolling consumers in and charging them for discount club memberships without their knowledge, consent, or a full understanding of the material terms of the transaction. ACTIVE does this by inserting a webpage into the online event registration and payment process that provides an offer for a free trial enrollment in a discount club membership called “Active Advantage.” Many consumers click on the highlighted call to action button—which is typically labeled “Accept”—because they believe that by doing so, they are accepting charges to participate in an event. Instead, consumers are enrolling in a trial membership in Active Advantage, which automatically converts to a paid subscription with an annual fee, unless consumers opt out by canceling their membership within 30 days.

MoneyLion is a fintech company (formerly known as MoneyLion Inc.) that offers online installment loans and other products to consumers through its lending subsidiaries and membership programs through its subsidiary ML Plus. The Military Lending Act (MLA) contains a number of protections for active-duty servicemembers and their dependents, defined as “covered borrowers.” The Bureau alleges that MoneyLion and its lending subsidiaries violated the MLA by: imposing membership fees on covered borrowers that, when combined with loan-interest-rate charges, exceeded the MLA’s annual percentage rate cap; inserting illegal arbitration provisions into contracts; requiring covered borrowers to submit to arbitration or in the case of a dispute, to reject the arbitration provision within thirty days of the date of the contract; demanding that borrowers provide written notice rejecting the arbitration provision within thirty days of the date of the contract as a condition for legal action; and failing to make required disclosures to covered borrowers. The Bureau also alleges that MoneyLion, its lending subsidiaries, and ML Plus engaged in deceptive acts or practices in violation of the Consumer Financial Protection Act of 2010 by misrepresenting that covered borrowers owed loan payments and associated fees that they did not in fact owe because loan contracts were void from their inception. The Bureau further alleges that MoneyLion and ML Plus engaged in unfair, deceptive, and abusive acts and practices by: not permitting consumers with unpaid loan balances to exit the membership program and stop monthly membership-fee charges; misrepresenting consumers’ right to cancel their memberships for any reason and not clearly disclosing these restrictions on membership cancellation when consumers took out loans; and continuing to charge and collect monthly membership fees after consumers had asked to cancel their memberships or terminate ACH-fee withdrawals.

Previously, in 2015, the BureauorderedRegions to cease certain unlawful conduct related to its charging overdraft fees to resolve the Bureau’s findings that Regions: (1) violated the law when it failed to obtain consent for overdraft fees from customers with linked savings accounts; and (2) deceived customers by charging them overdraft fees in connection with repaying deposit advances despite the bank’s representations that it would not charge such fees. In this case, the Bureau found that, from August 2018 through July 2021, Regions charged overdraft fees on debit-card purchases and ATM withdrawals even though consumers had sufficient funds when they made the transaction ( “Authorized-Positive Overdraft Fees”). There is a delay between the time a customer made a purchase with a debit card and when Regions pays the merchant from the customer’s account for the purchase. When a customer had sufficient funds in their account to make a debit-card purchase, Regions authorized the transaction and indicated that it was “holding” those funds aside. And yet, until July 2021, when it came time for Regions to pay the merchant for the initial purchase, Regions charged an overdraft fee on that purchase if the account’s available funds were insufficient to cover the purchase at that time. Regions assessed these fees as a result of counter-intuitive, complex practices that it knew customers did not understand. The Bureau found that Regions acted unfairly and abusively in violation of the Consumer Financial Protection Act of 2010 when it charged these Authorized-Positive Overdraft Fees fees. The Bureau also found that Regions could have discontinued the fee years ago but chose to wait while it pursued changes that would generate new overdraft fees to make up for the lost revenue from the illegal fee.

The Bureau found that Hello Digit engaged in deceptive acts or practices because, in fact, Hello Digit’s automated-savings tool routinely caused consumers’ checking accounts to overdraft and Hello Digit did not always reimburse consumers for overdraft fees caused by the auto-save tool. The Bureau also found that as early as mid-2017, Hello Digit deceived consumers when it represented that it would not keep any interest earned on consumer funds that it was holding, when in fact Hello Digit kept a significant amount of the interest earned.

The Bureau found that Bank of America engaged in unfair acts or practices by denying prepaid debit cardholders’ notices of error and freezing their prepaid debit card accounts based solely on the results of the Bank’s flawed fraud filter.

Further, Bank of America engaged in unfair acts and practices by impeding unemployment insurance benefit prepaid debit cardholders’ efforts to file notices of error concerning their prepaid debit card accounts. The Bank’s failure to conduct a reasonable investigation of prepaid debit cardholders’ notices of error and failure to timely investigate and resolve prepaid debit cardholders’ error claims also violated the Electronic Fund Transfer Act and its implementing Regulation E. The Bureau’s order requires Bank of America to redress harmed consumers who suffered hundreds of millions of dollars in direct and consequential financial harm; harmed consumers will also be eligible to receive additional remediation through an individualized review process. The Bank must also review and reform its unemployment insurance benefit prepaid debit card program and pay a $100 million civil penalty to the Bureau.

(“ACE”).","On July 12, 2022, the Bureau filed a lawsuit in the U.S. District Court for the Northern District of Texas against Populus Financial Group, Inc., which does business as ACE Cash Express, Inc. (“ACE”). ACE is a payday lender headquartered in Irving, Texas and has approximately 979 stores in 22 states and the District of Columbia. The Bureau had previously found that ACE abusively induced borrowers with a demonstrated inability to repay their existing loan to take out a new ACE loan with accompanying fees, andon July 10, 2014, the Bureau ordered ACEto cease encouraging or suggesting that a delinquent borrower pay off their loan and then take out a new loan. ACE’s loans come with a fee that is equivalent to a triple-digit interest rate, and consumers who cannot afford to pay back the loan and this fee often refinance their loans, incurring another fee to extend their loan for 14 or 30 days. Consumers in ten states, however, had the contractual right to one free repayment plan per year, which is designed to help consumers get out of a debt trap. Under the free repayment plan, consumers would owe their outstanding balance in four equal installments over their next four paydays, rather than owing one lump sum, without paying any additional fees or interest. The Bureau alleges that ACE engaged in unfair, abusive, and deceptive acts or practices in violation of the Consumer Financial Protection Act of 2010 (“CFPA”) by concealing this free repayment plan from consumers who were entitled to it, instead inducing them to refinance their loans for additional fees. As alleged in the complaint, since July 10, 2014, hundreds of thousands of consumers have paid ACE over $240 million in reborrowing fees while eligible for a free repayment plan. The Bureau also alleges that when ACE attempted to collect payment on its payday and title loans ACE unfairly made electronic withdrawals of consumers’ money without their authorization.

Until AMS sold its assets to RAM Payment on January 4, 2019, AMS operated as “Reliant Account Management” and offered account maintenance and payment processing services to debt relief companies and to consumers.

The order also bans AMS, Winters, and Chaya from the debt relief payment processing and account maintenance industry, and, among other things, RAM Payment must (1) stop providing services to both student loan debt relief service providers and debt relief service providers receiving funding from or owned by an affiliated company; (2) stop paying commission to third-party marketing companies for consumer referrals; and (3) consent to the Bureau’s supervisory authority.

A garnishment notice is a notice issued by a court or judgment creditor directing a financial institution to freeze and then turn over a consumer’s funds to pay off a court-ordered debt. The Bureau found that Bank of America engaged in unfair and deceptive acts and practices in violation of the Consumer Financial Protection Act of 2010. Specifically, Bank of America unfairly required consumers to waive its liability as to consumers’ garnishment-related protections in its deposit agreement and misrepresented to consumers that they could not go to court to attempt to prevent wrongful garnishments. This conduct violated the CFPA. The Bureau also found that Bank of America failed to disclose to courts in states that restricted the garnishment of out-of-state accounts that the garnishment notice pertained to bank accounts located out-of-state; and Bank of America froze accounts and sent funds to creditors even though prohibited by state law. Bank of America also in some instances applied the wrong state’s exemption laws and represented to consumers that their rights to have certain funds exempted from garnishment were governed by the law of the issuing state when in reality the consumer’s own state law applies. The consent order requires Bank of America to refund at least $592,000 in, or cancel, associated unlawful garnishment-related fees and pay a $10 million civil money penalty.

The Public Service Loan Forgiveness (PSLF) Program is a government program that forgives student-loan debt for certain borrowers who work in public service and make 120 qualifying loan payments. Ordinarily, FFELP loans must be consolidated into Direct Loans before any payments qualify towards the PSLF program; but in October 2021 the Department of Education provided a limited waiver allowing payments to FFELP loans to retroactively qualify so long as the borrower consolidated into Direct Loans by a certain date. The Bureau found that Edfinancial made various deceptive statements to FFELP borrowers, including in many instances telling borrowers that they were not eligible for the PSLF program even though borrowers could become eligible by consolidating their loans; that borrowers could not consolidate their loans; that borrowers’ past payments qualified when they did not qualify; and that qualifying jobs did not qualify for PSLF. The Bureau also found that, in numerous instances, when FFELP borrowers asked about forgiveness options available to them, Edfinancial’s representatives did not mention PSLF as an available option. The consent order requires Edfinancial to contact all its FFELP borrowers to inform them of the limited waiver so that eligible borrowers can take advantage of the waiver before it expires.

In 2016, the Bureau issued an administrative consent order against LendUp to address the Bureau’s finding that LendUp misled consumers about the benefits of its loans. That order prohibits LendUp from misrepresenting the benefits of borrowing from the company. In this action, the Bureau alleged that, though LendUp claimed that consumers who ascended the LendUp Ladder would gain access to lower interest rates and larger loans, many borrowers did not actually get those benefits. The Bureau alleged that LendUp’s marketing claims were deceptive under the Consumer Financial Protection Act of 2010 and violated the prohibitions of the Bureau’s 2016 order. The Bureau also alleged that LendUp failed to timely issue required adverse-action notices and failed to provide accurate denial reasons on its adverse-action notices to thousands of loan applicants, in violation of the Equal Credit Opportunity Act and Regulation B, and that these violations also constitute violations of the CFPA.",[],,,['Civil Action'],3:21-cv-06945,"SEP 08, 2021",Post Order/Post Judgment,"['Fair Lending', 'Short Term, Small Dollar']"

(Seterus), a former mortgage servicer based in North Carolina, and Kyanite Services, Inc. (Kyanite), Seterus’s former parent company and its successor in interest. The consent order addresses widespread failures in Seterus’s handling and processing of struggling homeowners’ applications for loss mitigation options to avoid foreclosure. The Bureau found that Seterus, which used automated processes for handling loss mitigation applications, violated the Consumer Financial Protection Act of 2010’s (CFPA) prohibition of unfair acts and practices by systematically failing to accurately review, process, track, and communicate to borrowers information regarding their applications, and deceptive acts and practices by sending numerous borrowers acknowledgment notices regarding their applications that misrepresented the status of borrower documents and provided inaccurate due dates for submission of borrower documents. The Bureau also found that Seterus violated Regulation X, which implements the Real Estate Settlement Procedures Act, by sending numerous acknowledgment notices that failed to state the additional documents and information borrowers needed to submit to complete their loss mitigation applications or failed to provide a reasonable due date for submission of borrower documents; failing to exercise reasonable diligence in obtaining documents and information necessary to complete borrowers’ loss mitigation applications; failing to properly evaluate borrowers who submitted complete loss mitigation applications for all loss mitigation options available to the borrower; and failing to treat certain applications as “facially complete” when required under Regulation X. These violations also constitute violations of the CFPA. The consent order requires Kyanite, as Seterus’s successor in interest, to pay $4,932,525 in total redress to approximately 11,866 of the consumers to whom Seterus sent a defective acknowledgment notice. The consent order also imposes a $500,000 civil money penalty and includes injunctive relief that would apply in the event Kyanite engages in mortgage servicing operations.",[],,,['Administrative Proceeding'],2020-BCFP-0024,"DEC 18, 2020",Post Order/Post Judgment,['Mortgage Servicing']

The Bureau found that during the period that RAB was obtaining judgments against consumers, RAB threatened to sue, sued, and demanded payment from consumers in Connecticut, New Jersey, and Rhode Island even though RAB did not hold the licenses that those states required to sue to collect debts.

The consent order prohibits RAB from collecting on the judgments against, or payment agreements from, consumers it obtained in Connecticut, New Jersey, and Rhode Island when RAB did not hold a required debt-collection license in those states.

The Bureau alleges that Townstone violated the Equal Credit Opportunity Act (ECOA); its implementing regulation, Regulation B; and the Consumer Financial Protection Act (CFPA). For years, Townstone drew almost no applications for properties in majority-African-American neighborhoods located in the Chicago-Naperville-Elgin Metropolitan Statistical Area (Chicago MSA) and few applications from African Americans throughout the Chicago MSA. The Bureau alleges that Townstone engaged in discriminatory acts or practices, including making statements during its weekly radio shows and podcasts through which it marketed its services, that discouraged prospective African-American applicants from applying for mortgage loans; discouraged prospective applicants living in African-American neighborhoods in the Chicago MSA from applying for mortgage loans; and discouraged prospective applicants living in other areas from applying for mortgage loans for properties located in African-American neighborhoods in the Chicago MSA. On November 25, 2020, the Bureau filed an amended complaint, which added as a defendant Barry Sturner, Townstone’s cofounder, sole owner, and sole director, as the fraudulent transferee of more than $2.4 million from Townstone. The defendants filed a motion to dismiss the amended complaint on February 8, 2021, which the court granted on February 3, 2023. The Bureau appealed, and, on July 11, 2024, the Seventh Circuit held that “an analysis of the text of the ECOA as a whole makes clear that the text prohibits not only outright discrimination against applicants for credit, but also the discouragement of prospective applicants for credit” and that “Regulation B’s prohibition on the discouragement of prospective applications is consistent with the plain text of the ECOA.” The court reversed the district court’s decision and remanded the case for further proceedings. On November 1, 2024, the Bureau filed a proposed stipulated final judgment and order against Townstone, which, if approved by the court, would prohibit Townstone from engaging in any acts or practices that violate ECOA in connection with offering or providing mortgage loans. It would also require Townstone to maintain a compliance management system and policies and procedures designed to ensure and test compliance with ECOA, provide ongoing education and training for employees, and pay a $105,000 civil money penalty.

On December 9, 2022, the court entered a stipulated final judgment and order which requires defendants to pay a civil money penalty of $391,530, of which $241,530 will be remitted because of defendants’ satisfaction of their obligation to pay that amount in penalties to the Securities and Exchange Commission for related conduct inSEC v. Radjabli et al., 2:21-cv-01761. The order also requires redress to consumers in the form of a refund of all the deposits made with defendants, including all interest due to consumers under the advertised terms of the purchased financial products and services. Defendants have represented to the Bureau that they have already satisfied the obligation to provide redress because they already refunded the full amount received from consumers, plus all interest due to consumers under the terms advertised. The Bureau estimates the redress amount to be approximately $19 million, but an exact calculation has not yet been completed. The order also permanently bans the defendants from engaging or assisting others in any deposit-taking activities.",[],,,['Civil Action'],1:20-cv-05159,"JUL 06, 2020",Post Order/Post Judgment,['Deposits']

The Bureau alleges that Navient Solutions and Navient Corporation: (1) engaged in abusive and unfair acts and practices in violation of the Consumer Financial Protection Act of 2010 (CFPA) by steering borrowers experiencing long-term financial hardship into forbearance, a costly option designed for borrowers experiencing short-term financial hardship, instead of adequately advising them about more beneficial income-driven repayment plans; (2) engaged in unfair acts and practices in violation of the CFPA by failing to adequately notify borrowers who enrolled in an income-driven repayment plan about the requirement to annually recertify their income and family size as required under the plan; (3) engaged in deceptive acts and practices in violation of the CFPA by misleading borrowers about the consequences of submitting an incorrect or incomplete application to recertify their income and family size under an income-driven repayment plan; (4) engaged in deceptive acts and practices in violation of the CFPA by misleading private student loan borrowers about requirements to release their co-signer from the loan; (5) engaged in unfair acts and practices under the CFPA by making numerous payment processing errors, including by misallocating and misapplying borrower payments; and (6) violated the Fair Credit Reporting Act’s implementing Regulation V by failing to establish and implement reasonable written policies and procedures to furnish accurate information to credit reporting agencies regarding borrowers who had received a discharge on their federal loans due to a total and permanent disability. The Bureau also alleges that Pioneer and Navient Corporation engaged in deceptive acts and practices in violation of the CFPA and Fair Debt Collection Practices Act by misleading borrowers about the effect of loan rehabilitation on their credit reports and the collection fees that would be forgiven in the federal loan rehabilitation program. On March 24, 2017, Navient moved to dismiss the complaint, which the court denied on August 4, 2017.

Single-payment auto title loans are usually due in 30 days, with some carrying an annual percentage rate of up to 300 percent. The Bureau found that store employees, as part of their sales pitch for the 30-day loans, offered consumers a “monthly option” for making loan payments and then offered consumers a “Voluntary Payback Guide” that showed how to repay the loan with smaller payments over a longer period. The guide and sales pitch did not explain the true cost of the loan if the consumer renewed it multiple times. The Bureau found that TMX Finance engaged in abusive conduct by materially interfering with consumers’ ability to make an informed judgment about whether to pay off the loan over a longer period: it materially interfered with consumers’ ability to understand that they are receiving a 30-day transaction, that the guide is not an actual repayment plan, and that renewing the transaction over an extended period of time would increase the overall costs of the transaction. TMX Finance also engaged in unfair debt collection practices by revealing information about consumers’ past-due debts while visiting their homes, references, or places of employment. The Bureau ordered TMX Finance to stop its unlawful practices and pay a $9 million penalty.",[],,,['Administrative Proceeding'],2016-CFPB-0022,"SEP 26, 2016",Expired/Terminated/Dismissed,"['Debt Collection', 'Short Term, Small Dollar']"

The Bureau alleges that they deceived consumers about the cost of short-term loans and that the company’s contracts did not disclose the costs consumers would pay under the default terms of the contracts. The Bureau also alleges that the company unfairly used remotely created checks to debit consumers’ bank accounts even after the consumers revoked authorization for automatic withdrawals. The Bureau is seeking injunctive relief, restitution, and the imposition of a civil money penalty. On September 27, 2016, the Administrative Law Judge (ALJ) issued a Recommended Decision finding liability and recommending injunctive and monetary relief. The Recommended Decision was appealed to the Director, but further activity on that appeal was held in abeyance pending a decision inPHH Corp. v. CFPB, No. 15-1177 (D.C. Cir.), and, subsequently, pending a decision inLucia v. SEC, No. 17-0130 (S. Ct.).

The Bureau also alleged that consumers who paid the fee received nothing or a generic booklet that failed to provide individualized advice. The Bureau also alleged that the defendants misrepresented their affiliation with government and university financial aid offices and pressured consumers to enroll through deceptive statements.

The Bureau brought suit alleging that the defendants violated Regulation O, formerly known as the Mortgage Assistance Relief Services Rule, by taking payments from consumers for mortgage modifications before the consumers signed a mortgage modification agreement from their lender, by failing to make required disclosures, by directing consumers not to contact lenders, and by making deceptive statements to consumers when providing mortgage assistance relief services. A trial was held in April 2017. On June 21, 2017, the district court entered a stipulated judgment against the bankruptcy estate of TMLG, which sought Chapter 7 bankruptcy. The court enjoined TMLG from operating and ordered TMLG to pay $18,331,737 in redress and $20,815,000 in civil money penalties. On May 29, 2018, the Bureau filed an unopposed motion to increase the redress amount ordered by the court to $18,716,725.78, based on newly discovered information about additional advance fees paid by consumers. The amended stipulated judgment against TMLG increasing redress to $18,716,725.78 was issued by the court on November 15, 2018. On November 15, 2018, the court issued an opinion and order ruling that defendants CFLG, Macey, Aleman, Searns, and Stafford violated Regulation O by taking upfront fees and by failing to make required disclosures, and that some of the defendants also violated Regulation O by directing consumers not to contact their lenders and by making deceptive statements. The court directed that the parties submit briefs addressing what damages, injunctive relief, and civil money penalties, if any, should be awarded. On November 4, 2019, the court issued an opinion and order against defendants CFLG, Macey, Aleman, Searns, and Stafford, imposing a total of $21,709,022 in restitution ($18.7 million of which TMLG is also jointly and severally liable for) and $37,294,250 in civil money penalties. CFLG, Macey, Aleman, and Searns were permanently enjoined from marketing, selling, providing, or assisting others in selling or providing any mortgage-assistance-relief or debt-relief products or services. Stafford was enjoined from marketing, selling, providing, or assisting others in selling or providing mortgage-assistance-relief services for five years. CFLG, Macey, Aleman, Searns, and Stafford filed an appeal with the Seventh Circuit on December 4, 2019. On July 23, 2021, the Seventh Circuit affirmed the district court’s rulings that defendants violated Regulation O, vacated the remedial order, and remanded to the district court for further proceedings on remedies. On August 1, 2022, the district court awarded $10,854,510.85 in restitution and $18,410,500 in penalties against the defendants, and imposed an eight-year ban on all the defendants except Stafford, whose five-year ban remained in place, on mortgage-assistance relief services. On August 11, 2022, defendants filed a notice of appeal, and the Bureau filed a notice of cross-appeal on September 15, 2022. On February 5, 2024, the remaining defendants entered into a settlement under which the parties dismissed their respective appeals, and on February 7, 2024, the Seventh Circuit dismissed the appeals. The settlement requires defendants to pay $10.9 million in consumer redress and a $1.1 million penalty. The individual defendants remain subject to the bans from the mortgage assistance industry under the district court’s August 1, 2022 order.","[{'text': 'Complaint', 'link': 'https://files.consumerfinance.gov/f/201407_cfpb_complaint_cfpb-v-tmlg-et-al.pdf'}, {'text': 'Amended Stipulated Final Judgment and Order - The Mortgage Law Group, LLP', 'link': 'https://files.consumerfinance.gov/f/documents/cfpb_amended-stipulated-judgment-and-order-tmlg_2018-11.pdf'}, {'text': 'Opinion and Order – Consumer First Legal Group, LLC, Thomas Macey, Jeffrey Aleman, Jason Searns, and Harold Stafford', 'link': 'https://files.consumerfinance.gov/f/documents/201911_cfpb_opinion-order_cfpb-v-tmlg-et-al.pdf'}, {'text': 'U.S. Court of Appeals Opinion – CFLG, Macey, Aleman, Searns, Stafford', 'link': 'https://files.consumerfinance.gov/f/documents/cfpb_cflg-us-court-of-appeals-opinion_2021-07.pdf'}, {'text': 'U.S. District Court Opinion and Order on Remand - CFLG, Macey, Aleman, Searns, Stafford', 'link': 'https://files.consumerfinance.gov/f/documents/cfpb_cflg-us-district-court-opinion-and-order-on-remand_2022-08.pdf'}, {'text': 'Settlement Agreement – CFLG, Macey, Aleman, Searns, Stafford', 'link': 'https://files.consumerfinance.gov/f/documents/cfpb_cflg-settlement-agreement_2024-02.pdf'}, {'text': 'Joint Dismissal Agreement – CFLG, Macey, Aleman, Searns, Stafford', 'link': 'https://files.consumerfinance.gov/f/documents/cfpb_cflg-joint-dismissal-agreement_2024-02.pdf'}, {'text': 'U.S. Court of Appeals Order of Dismissal - CFLG, Macey, Aleman, Searns, Stafford', 'link': 'https://files.consumerfinance.gov/f/documents/cfpb_cflg-order-of-dismissal_2024-02.pdf'}, {'text': 'CFPB, FTC and States Announce Sweep Against Foreclosure Relief Scammers', 'link': 'https://www.consumerfinance.gov/newsroom/cfpb-ftc-and-states-announce-sweep-against-foreclosure-relief-scammers/'}, {'text': 'CFPB Secures $12 Million From Ringleaders of Foreclosure Relief Scam', 'link': '/about-us/newsroom/cfpb-secures-12-million-from-ringleaders-of-foreclosure-relief-scam/'}]",https://www.consumerfinance.govhttps://www.consumerfinance.gov/newsroom/cfpb-ftc-and-states-announce-sweep-against-foreclosure-relief-scammers/,,['Civil Action'],3:14-cv-00513,"JUL 22, 2014",Post Order/Post Judgment,['Debt Relief']

Paul Reddam; WS Funding, LLC, a subsidiary; and Delbert Services Corporation, an affiliate, for collecting money consumers did not owe. The Bureau’s amended complaint, filed on March 21, 2014, alleges that the defendants violated the Consumer Financial Protection Act of 2010’s prohibition against unfair, deceptive, and abusive acts or practices by collecting and attempting to collect consumer-installment loans that were void or uncollectible because they violated either state caps on interest rates or state licensing requirements for lenders. The Bureau alleges that CashCall serviced loans it made in the name of an entity, Western Sky, which was located on the Cheyenne River Sioux Tribe’s land. The loan agreements included a choice-of-law provision saying that the Tribe’s law applied to the loans. The case was transferred to the Central District of California, where defendants were based, on September 23, 2015. On August 31, 2016, the court granted the Bureau’s motion for partial summary judgment, concluding that the choice-of-law provision in the loan agreements was not enforceable and that the law of the borrowers’ states applied, resulting in the loans being void or uncollectible. Because the loans were void, the court found that the defendants engaged in deceptive acts or practices by demanding and collecting payment on debts that consumers did not owe. A two-day trial was held in October 2017 on the issue of appropriate relief. On January 19, 2018, the court issued findings of fact and conclusions of law imposing a $10.28 million civil money penalty but denying the Bureau’s request for restitution and an injunction. The Bureau and the defendants appealed. On May 23, 2022, the Ninth Circuit affirmed the district court’s finding of liability; vacated the district court’s penalty, remanding for the district court to re-assess the penalty amount taking into account defendants’ reckless conduct; and vacated the district court’s decision to award no restitution, remanding to the district court to determine whether and what restitution would be appropriate in consideration of the Ninth Circuit Court’s opinion. On February 10, 2023, the district court issued an order awarding the Bureau a $33,276,264 civil money penalty and $134,058,600 in restitution.
