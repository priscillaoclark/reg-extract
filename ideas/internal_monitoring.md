- **Text Classification** using machine learning models to categorize documents

  ```python
  from sklearn.feature_extraction.text import TfidfVectorizer
  from sklearn.naive_bayes import MultinomialNB

  vectorizer = TfidfVectorizer()
  X = vectorizer.fit_transform(documents)
  model = MultinomialNB()
  model.fit(X, y_labels)
  ```

   ```python
   import re

   pattern = re.compile(r'\b(bribe|kickback|fraud)\b', re.IGNORECASE)
   if pattern.search(text):
       print("Potential compliance issue detected.")
   ```

2. **Supervised Learning Models**:

   - **Algorithms**: Random Forest, SVM, Logistic Regression
   - **Feature Extraction**: TF-IDF, Word Embeddings (Word2Vec, GloVe)

3. **Deep Learning Models**:

   - **Recurrent Neural Networks (RNNs)** for sequential data
   - **Transformers** (e.g., BERT, GPT) for contextual understanding

   ```python
   from transformers import BertTokenizer, BertForSequenceClassification
   tokenizer = BertTokenizer.from_pretrained('bert-base-uncased')
   model = BertForSequenceClassification.from_pretrained('bert-base-uncased')
   inputs = tokenizer("Sample text", return_tensors="pt")
   outputs = model(**inputs)
   ```

### **Training and Evaluation**
