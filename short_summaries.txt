The email highlights a loophole in Regulation DD, which governs the Truth in Savings Act, concerning disclosures for variable-rate accounts. Currently, the regulation only requires specific disclosures for fixed-rate accounts, leaving variable-rate accounts without clear notification requirements. This gap has been exploited by some entities to attract consumers with high Annual Percentage Yields (APYs) and then lower them without notice. The sender urges the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau (CFPB) to address this issue promptly by amending Regulation DD to mandate at least a 10-day notice to consumers before any interest rate or APY changes on their accounts.
